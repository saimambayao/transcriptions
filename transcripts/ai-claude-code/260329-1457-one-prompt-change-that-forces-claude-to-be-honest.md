## Organized Notes

**The Honesty Gap Problem**

- As AI models get smarter, they get **worse at admitting when they're wrong** -- intelligence increases but honesty stays flat
- **Dylan Davis**, AI consultant who uses Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini daily across client work, explains this as the "honesty gap"
- OpenAI published a research paper confirming this exact phenomenon
- Two compounding problems:
  1. **AI sycophancy** -- the model wants to please you and give an answer rather than say "I don't know"
  2. **Automation bias** -- as AI sounds more confident, humans trust it more and check its output less
- This creates a **dangerous feedback loop**: smarter AI + more confident output + less human checking = compounding errors over time

**Where AI Guessing Manifests**

- The most common category is when asking AI to **extract information from a source** (reports, Excel sheets, contracts, emails)
- AI may **infer from its own knowledge base** instead of sticking to the provided document
- Concrete examples:
  - **Contract review**: two clauses mention different payment terms (net 30 vs net 45), AI picks one and ignores the other
  - **Meeting notes**: AI sees "let's circle back next week" and **invents a specific date and task owner**
  - Also applies to: invoices, receipts, legal documents, insurance, leases, vendor scoring, CRM building

**Rule 1: Force Blank Answers with Explanations**

- **Do NOT use confidence scores** -- giving AI a confidence scale just gives it another way to lie (it may say "8/10 confidence" when the real answer is zero)
- Instead, instruct the AI to **return a blank value** when it's uncertain or doesn't know
- Require a **"reason" column** explaining why the field is blank
- Two benefits:
  1. You can **quickly skim for blanks** and focus review only on those
  2. The explanation tells you **exactly where the error is** so you can fix it yourself
- Prompt structure:
  - State the purpose: "Extract the following fields from this document into a table"
  - **Grounding rule**: "Only extract values explicitly stated in the document"
  - **Permission to be blank**: "If the value is ambiguous, missing, or unclear, leave the field blank"
  - **Require explanation**: "Add a 'reason' column with a one-sentence explanation for each blank"
  - **Reassurance**: "Base every value on what the document actually says; quote and reference specific sections"

**Rule 2: Change the Incentive Mechanism**

- By default, the AI sees a wrong answer and a blank answer as **equally bad** -- so it defaults to guessing because it wants to give you something
- Fix this with a single line: **"A wrong answer is 3x worse than a blank answer"**
- Analogy: telling a new employee that wrong answers cost the company 3x more than saying "I don't know" -- they'll give you more blanks and fewer wrong answers
- Prompt: "A wrong answer is 3x more than a blank answer. When in doubt, leave it blank."

**Rule 3: Force Source Attribution (Safety Net)**

- Even with rules 1 and 2, AI will **drift back to inferring** on complex tasks -- it keeps getting pulled away from the system instruction
- Add a **"source" column** to every extracted field with one of two values:
  - **"Extracted"** -- value came word-for-word from the document
  - **"Inferred"** -- AI derived the answer from surrounding context, calculated, or interpreted something
- For inferred values, require an **"evidence" column** with a one-sentence explanation of what was inferred and from where
- This is a **safety net**: even when the AI ignores your instructions, you can quickly skim for "inferred" tags and validate only those

**The Combined Framework**

- All three rules together **reduce the review burden**: instead of checking everything, you only check blanks + inferred fields
- This **increases trust** with AI output because you have a systematic way to validate
- Dylan shares the full prompt template in the video description for copy-paste use

*Quotable Quotes:*

> "The smarter these models get, the more confidently they guess instead of admitting that they don't know." [00:10]

> "A wrong answer is 3x worse than a blank answer. When in doubt, leave it blank." [06:26]

> "We're reducing the burden on ourselves and increasing our trust with AI because we don't have to check everything it gives us. Instead, all we have to do is check the blanks as well as the areas where it inferred." [08:32]

## What This Means for Your Work

Dylan's three-rule framework directly addresses a problem you've already solved in a more sophisticated way through your **Universal Verification Framework** (Prevent-Detect-Confirm) and `/fact-checker` skill. But his approach surfaces a key insight worth integrating: **shifting the burden of proof to the AI at prompt time**, rather than only catching errors after output.

Your current pipeline is strong on the **Detect** and **Confirm** layers -- `/fact-checker` catches fabricated BAA numbers, BOL article swaps, and ministry abbreviation errors after the content is generated. But Dylan's Rule 1 (force blank answers) and Rule 3 (force source attribution) operate at the **Prevent** layer, which is where your source-preload protocol already lives. The gap is that your subagent prompts tell agents *what sources to use* but don't explicitly penalize guessing or require extracted-vs-inferred tagging on every claim.

This is especially relevant for your **guidebook production pipeline**. When subagents draft chapters for the Bill Drafting Guidebook, CSW Manual, or MOP guidebooks, they routinely fabricate BAA numbers and cite non-existent provisions -- exactly the pattern Dylan describes with contract extraction. His "3x penalty for wrong answers" rule (Rule 2) is a lightweight prompt addition that could reduce fabrication rates before `/fact-checker` even runs.

**Concrete next steps:**
- Add Dylan's Rule 2 ("wrong answer is 3x worse than blank") to the universal subagent prompt template you use for BARMM content generation
- For `/legislative-briefer` and `/bill-drafter`, add Rule 3's extracted/inferred tagging requirement so every legal citation is tagged as "extracted from [source]" or "inferred from [context]" -- this makes `/fact-checker` verification faster
- Test whether combining your source-preload protocol with Dylan's blank-answer incentive reduces the `/fact-checker` error rate on a sample guidebook chapter

### How This Can Improve Your Claude Skills and Workflows

**Skill improvements:**

- `/fact-checker` -- The extracted/inferred tagging from Rule 3 could be built into the skill's **Prevent** phase. If content-generating skills tag every factual claim as extracted or inferred at generation time, `/fact-checker` can prioritize checking inferred claims first, reducing verification time significantly
- `/bangsamoro` -- Your subagent prompts for Bangsamoro content already include fabrication warnings and `[UNVERIFIED]` rules, but adding the explicit "3x penalty" line and blank-answer permission would reinforce the behavior. This directly addresses the feedback in `feedback_fact_check_errors.md` about BOL article swaps and BAA number inventions
- `/content-research-writer` and `/deep-research` -- Both could benefit from Rule 3's source column approach. Instead of just producing citations, require each claim to be tagged extracted/inferred so the user can quickly skim for inferred claims that need validation
- `/legal-assistant` and `/legal-reviewer` -- The extracted/inferred distinction maps directly to legal analysis: a provision "extracted" from BOL Art. XII is different from a conclusion "inferred" from multiple provisions. Making this explicit in the output format would strengthen the Legal QA Loop

**Workflow changes:**

- **Subagent prompt template** -- Your parallel agent workflows dispatch multiple subagents for guidebook chapters. Adding Dylan's three rules as a standard footer to every subagent prompt could reduce fabrication rates across the board, meaning fewer `/fact-checker` iterations needed
- **NotebookLM pipeline** -- When `/research-pipeline` sends content to NotebookLM for analysis, the returned analysis could be tagged with extracted/inferred markers before being incorporated into knowledge notes. This would make the vault's knowledge-areas notes more trustworthy

**New skill opportunity:**

- Consider a `/prompt-guardrails` skill or prompt fragment library that automatically injects Dylan's three rules (blank answers, 3x penalty, source tagging) into any extraction or analysis prompt. This would be a reusable building block rather than something you remember to add manually each time. Check if this overlaps with your existing `/prompter` skill -- it likely complements rather than duplicates, since `/prompter` focuses on intent clarification while this focuses on output honesty constraints

## Transcript

[00:00] The newest AI models are the smartest that we've ever had. They're also the worst at telling you when they're wrong. For those of you that are new here, hi, I'm Dylan. I run an AI consultancy and I

[00:10] use Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini every single day across all my client work. And the smarter these models get, the more confidently they guess instead of admitting that they don't know. Now, this video gives you three prompt rules that fix that. I'll walk you through

[00:27] each one and give you the exact prompt that stops the guessing completely. So, let's get into it. So, this is the challenge we're all facing. As new model

[00:35] generations are released, its intelligence increases, which is a benefit. But the negative here is that the more intelligent AI becomes, the less likely it the less likely it is to admit that it's wrong. So, its honesty stays the same, its intelligence increases, which causes the honesty gap.

[00:54] And this is known by many researchers. Open AI just published a research paper on this exact topic. And that's just one of two problems. So with this first

[01:01] problem, we know as the intelligence increases, the AI wants to please us and it wants to give us an answer instead of just saying it doesn't know. That's the first problem. And the second problem is actually you and me. That's what we call

[01:10] automation bias. So what's happening here is as the AI sounds more confident, as its intelligence increases, we start to trust it more, which means we check its output less, which in turn causes errors that compound over time. And this loop feeds back into itself as the intelligence gets smarter and smarter and smarter. So if we don't add any

[01:29] checks and balances here, there's a high probability that we're missing stuff that's critical for us not to miss. And this challenge is something that all of us will face. Here are just a few use cases that I've seen this manifest when working with clients. But it's important

[01:40] to note this is just a small sampling. This can happen and likely does happen in hundreds of cases. The most common category of task where AI guesses is when you're asking the AI to pull something directly from a source. So if

[01:51] you've given it a report, an Excel sheet, a contract, an email, whatever else, you wanted to extract that information and do something with it. In the process of extracting that information and giving you the answer, it may infer things from its own knowledge base, the internet or elsewhere, and that might go against what you actually wanted to do. Some clear examples of this is say you have the AI reviewing contracts for you.

[02:10] Well, we're reviewing those contracts. There could be two clauses in there that talk about payment terms, but the AI just picks one and gives you an answer from that and ignores a second. Another one could be a simple thing with meeting notes. So, say you have a transcript and

[02:22] you have the AI extracting action items from that and it sees in the transcript that somebody said, "Let's circle back next week." From this, the AI may infer that it's going to just choose a specific date as well as give that task to a specific owner. And sometimes the AI inferring from the context is useful, but most times you at least want to check it. And there are many other use

[02:40] cases that I've seen. So, extracting information from invoices and receipts, checking legal documents for insurance and leases, scoring different vendors against each other, building out CRM, all types of things. Quick pause in your regular programming. This video is

[02:52] brought to you by me as always. So, two quick things. First off, Blow is a 30-day AI insight series, completely free. You'll get 30 insights in your

[03:01] inbox so I can apply AI to your business and your work. The second thing is if you'd like to work with me, blow a series of offerings to see if there's a good fit from the two of us. Now, let's get back in the video. So, we know the

[03:10] challenge and we know where this potentially could pop up. Now, let's actually walk through the rules of how we can mitigate this. So, the first rule is forcing the AI to give us blank answers when it doesn't know the answer.

[03:20] And a common thing people mess up here is instead of asking the AI to give them nothing, they ask them to give me something but give me a confidence score associated to that answer. With this approach, we're giving the AI another out to lie to us. It could give us an eight confidence score, but really it's probably a zero. So, we don't want to

[03:36] leave that up to AI. We want to remove that responsibility from them and have them just give us evidence. And the way we're going to do that is we're going to ask the AI to give us a blank value when it's uncertain or doesn't know. In

[03:46] addition to the blank value, it has to tell us why it's uncertain. So, it has to give us an explanation of why it doesn't know the answer. This helps us in two big ways. One is we can quickly

[03:55] skim all the values, seeing the ones that are blank, and those that are blank we can check quickly. In addition to that, by forcing the AI to explain why it doesn't know, it gives us an easier way to identify exactly where the error is and fix it ourselves quickly. So let's see what this looks like in action. So on the left hand side we have

[04:11] no rule. So this is using it without the rule. And here we can see we're extracting data from a contract. We have

[04:17] payment terms, renewal date, liability cap, etc. All the values been have been populated by the AI. Now we have the rule turned on with the prompt. And

[04:25] instead of having all the values filled in, we have a few different blanks here. And these blanks have reasons as to why they're blank. So for the payment terms, we can see that the AI stated on pages 8 and 14, there are two different payment terms, net 30 and net 45. That's why I

[04:39] left it blank. So we as the user, we can look at this and say, okay, we want net30 or we want net 45. But we don't have to have the AI decide that for us.

[04:46] And the prompt here is simple to actually enable this specific rule. It's only a few lines. So at the very top, we're stating that I want you to extract the following fields from this document into the table. So we're giving it a

[04:56] purpose. Below that are the rules and this is the important part. So the first rule is stating that we can only extract values that are explicitly stated in the document. So this here is a concept

[05:05] called grounding. So we're grounding the AI in the source document ensuring that it only gets information from here and nowhere else. And after that we're giving the AI an out. So we're saying

[05:13] it's okay to give us no answer. So if the value is ambiguous, missing or unclear, I want you to leave that field blank. In addition to leaving the field blank, you also need to add a column called reason. And next to those blank

[05:25] fields, I want you to give a one-sentence explanation as to why you left it blank. And then we add a last reassurance at the bottom, reaffirming that the AI should base every value on what the document actually says, and it should quote and reference specific sections that it pulled from for that blank section. So this is our first rule in first prompt, where we're forcing the AI to give us blank answers when it doesn't know and explaining why it's blank. The second rule is actually

[05:47] changing the incentive mechanism because currently the way the AI sees these answers is it equates a wrong answer to the same value as a blank answer. And we want to change that. We don't want the AI to think that these are the same because if it does, it's likely going to default to the wrong answer because it wants to give you something. So to

[06:03] change that, we're just going to add a single line prompt that alters the incentive in the AI's head. So instead of saying this, we're going to say that a wrong answer is three times worse than a blank answer. And imagine if you have a new employee and you hire them and they want to please you and they want to give you answers. Well, if you tell them

[06:18] that if you give me a wrong answer, it costs the company 3x more than a blank answer. They're likely going to give you a lot more blank answers than wrong answers. The same thing applies here.

[06:26] And this is the prompt. Like I said, it's very basic. All we're saying is a wrong answer is 3x more than a blank answer. When in doubt, leave it blank.

[06:33] That's it. That's rule two, changing the incentives. The final rule is forcing the AI to show the source. And we're

[06:39] doing this because again we're fighting a battle that the AI is constantly being pulled into. So say we've given our instructions here and the instructions explicitly state that we want the AI to extract only information from the document and nothing else. Well, over time as the AI is working on a complex task, it will continually want to infer.

[06:57] So it keeps getting pulled away from the system instruction that we gave it and it's wanting to go back to its old ways. So when this occurs for rule three, we want to have a safety net that catches it. And that's what this third rule is all about. Even when the AI wants to

[07:09] avoid what we're asking it to do, we're still going to have a safety net to catch it. And here's the prompt for that. So in this prompt, we're saying that for each field, I want you to add another column. So every field that you

[07:19] extract, and that column is going to be the source column. In the source column, you're going to add one of two answers. Either you're going to say the value is extracted because you got it word for word from the document like I asked you, or you're going to say inferred, and that's when the AI derived the answer from the surrounding context, it calculated something or interpreted something itself. and for the inferred

[07:37] column. So when you add this value, if you do add this value, I also want you to have an evidence column right next to that that tells me exactly in one sentence explaining what you inferred from where. Now remember the reason we have to do this, even though we've asked the AI to only extract stuff and not infer stuff and give us blank answers, it will over time on complex tasks start to infer. And when it does, we want to

[07:58] have an out or a safety net to ensure that when it does, it gives us an answer as to why. And this is what it looks like through an example. So say we're still extracting information from the contract. We have the field names that

[08:07] we're extracting. We have the values and then right next to that we have the source. So the source is the information I mentioned previously. So we have the

[08:13] extracted, the extracted and inferred. For the extracted, it has the evidence column telling me exactly where it got it from. For the inferred section, it's telling me exactly what it inferred and from where. So again, this makes it easy

[08:24] for me to skim and validate the AI's output. So instead of looking at everything, I'm just looking at the inferred fields. And that's our third rule. But we're adding a safety net when

[08:32] the AI decides to infer on more complex tasks. And this is what it looks like altogether. And as a reminder, the reason we're doing this and we're adding this to every single prompt that our AI extracts information with is we're reducing the burden on ourselves and increasing our trust with AI because we don't have to check everything it gives us. Instead, all we have to do is check

[08:50] the blanks as well as the areas where it inferred. We can skim and approve the rest. And I'll share this presentation with you below in the description so you can get access to this prompt and all the subprompts. So you can copy and

[09:00] paste this anywhere you like. Now, as a quick recap of the three rules. So the first one is we're forcing the AI to give us blank information as well as explain why it's blank instead of allowing it just to fill in the gaps and give us wrong answers. After that, we're

[09:13] penalizing the AI and trying to change the incentives. So we're telling it that if you give us a wrong answer, that's three times worse than just giving us a blank answer of saying I don't know. And finally, in rule three, we're asking the AI to show the source. Because even

[09:25] though we've stated we only want the AI to extract information on complex tasks, it will likely still infer. When it does, we want it to show the evidence as to why it did. So, it can quickly skim, find the area that's been inferred, check the evidence, and see if it's right or wrong. And that's it. So, as a

[09:39] quick reminder, two things. First off, Blow is a 30-day AI insight series, completely free. You'll get 30 insights in your inbox so I can apply AI to your business and your work. And the second

[09:49] thing is, if you'd like to work with me, Blow a series of offerings to see if there's a good fit between the two of us. So, these prompts handle accuracy, but accuracy is just one piece of using AI well. I mapped out four levels that every AI user moves through. Most people

[10:03] skip to the end, and that's exactly why they stall out. I'll show you where you are and what to focus on next in this video right here. So, go ahead, click that video, internet. Click it. I'll see

[10:13] you next time.
