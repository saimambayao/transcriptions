PROPOSED RESOLUTION No. 53

*Introduced by* **MP JAAFAR APOLLO MIKHAIL L. MATALAM**

**A RESOLUTION URGING THE BANGSAMORO TRANSITION AUTHORITY (BTA) PARLIAMENT THROUGH THE APPROPRIATE COMMITTEE TO PRIORITIZE THE CONVERSION AND ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SPECIAL GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, COMPOSED OF SIXTY-THREE (63) BARANGAYS, INTO MUNICIPALITIES GRANTING THEM CORPORATE PERSONALITY AND IDENTITY, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.**

**WHEREAS,** Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is composed of, *inter alia*, sixty-three (63) barangays in the Special Geographic Areas (SGAs) in Cotabato province, located in parts of Aleosan, Carmen, Kabacan, Midsayap, Pigcawayan, and Pikit;

**WHEREAS,** the inclusion of the SGAs in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) since then, deprived them of their identity as belonging to a unique local government unit;

**WHEREAS,** the challenge of uncertainty and ambivalence is forced upon the constituents of SGAs, leaving them at loose ends, and still anticipating whether their welfare and protection will be secured and fully afforded to them;

**WHEREAS,** the proposition to convert the SGAs and establish them into Municipalities will settle obscurities on their identity and autonomy, at once;

**WHEREAS,** Section 2(l), Article V of the RA 11054 otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law provides the Bangsamoro Government the power to create, divide, merge, abolish or alter boundaries of municipalities and barangays within its territorial jurisdiction;

**WHEREAS,** the conversion of the SGAs into functional local government units will grant them corporate personality, enabling them to enjoy genuine and meaningful local autonomy as self-reliant Municipalities;

**WHEREAS,** the conversion of SGAs into Municipalities will empower them to enact public local policies and laws, implement and enforce them, govern their territorial jurisdictions, and formulate development plans;

**WHEREAS,** the conversion of the SGAs into Municipalities will lead to them to fulfill an administrative purpose of supplying goods and services, and will enable them to establish local peace and order council that will institutionalize a mechanism to manage all efforts towards the maintenance of peace, public order, and safety;

**WHEREAS,** the conversion of the SGAs into Municipalities will enable them to enter contracts and other transactions, impose and generate revenues of their own through their elected and appointed officials;

**WHEREAS,** the conversion will empower the crucial aspect of democratization and intensification of mass participation in the decision-making process of local government units;

**WHEREAS,** if left unheeded, the political system of SGAs will remain incomplete, for not having a system of a local government;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED,** by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) Parliament to urge the appropriate committee to prioritize the conversion and establishment of the Special Geographic Areas, composed of sixty-three (63) barangays, into Municipalities, in order to grant them their corporate personality and identity, and for other purposes.
