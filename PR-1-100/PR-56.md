**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

According to 2015 National Nutrition Survey, BARMM nutritional status among under five children showed 24.5% in underweight, 45.2% are stunted, wasted at 8.2% compared to 4.2% (national), while 93% among 6-23 months children failed to meet the minimum acceptable diet, and 19.5% nutritionally at risk pregnant women versus national of 24.5% respectively.

The Republic Act No. 7160, or the Local Government Code of 1991 states “*devolved to the Local Government Units the delivery of basic services including nutrition*”. Nutrition Programs are key turning points in implementation strategies leading to food and nutrition improvement as a basis for socio-economic development. For this to be effective and successful, a holistic approach with convergence of services supported with approved fund budget and policy is critical.

Complimentary to the Salamat Excellence for Leadership Award (SEAL), the national government through the National Nutrition Council annually honors and recognizes outstanding Local Government Units nationwide. To date, there were about 90 LGUs none from BARMM of any of this award, that received the Green Banner, Consistent Regional Outstanding Winner in Nutrition (CROWN) and Nutrition Honor Award (NHA) from 2011-2016, while 234 LGUs had received at least one of the awards in the past.

Salamat Excellence for Leadership Award (SEAL) of BARMM shall be trailblazer recognition among all regions in giving credit to champions of nutrition. To include nutrition intervention as major criteria for the prestigious award given by MILG, these includes Annual Investment Plan for Health and Nutrition, the creation of Local Nutrition Committee, Local Nutrition Action Plan, and the hiring and capacitation of Barangay Nutrition Scholars and Registered Nutritionist-Dietitian, as support to Presidential Decree 1569, House Bill No. 6427 the Magna Carta of Barangay Nutrition Scholars, Republic Act No. 11148 the “Kalusugan at Nutrisyon ng Magnanay Act”, the Joint Department of Interior and Local Government–Department of Health Memorandum No. 2019-001 the integration of PPAN 2017-2022 and Letter of Instruction 441 of DILG.

The Local Chief Executive, as the champion, mobilizes the people under his care to support, adopt and practice good nutrition, with the help of properly selected and well-trained volunteers, the Barangay Nutrition Scholars.

The BNS upon the recommendation of the City/Municipal Nutrition Action Officers are from the barangays that undergo intensive training in the delivery of standard nutrition services: monitoring the growth of preschool children, giving lectures in simple nutrition practices especially among pregnant and lactating women, and timely delivery of food and vitamin supplements to targeted population and assist in the conduct of OPT, height and MUAC measurements. About 44,000 BNS are now serving the country, including the 548 active BNS of BARMM.

Thus, this resolution seeks the Ministry of the Interior and Local Government to include nutrition programs and its components as major criteria for the participation in SEAL Award by MILG BARMM, to wit;

a. the activation of Local Nutrition Committees,
b. integration of Local Nutrition Action Plan to LGUs Annual Investment Programme,
c. recruitment of Barangay Nutrition Scholars, and
d. designated or hire a Registered Nutritionist and Dietitian
