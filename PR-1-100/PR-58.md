**“RESOLUTION URGING THE MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT (ECCD) IN THE FIRST 1000 DAYS (F1KD) PROGRAM IN ALL LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNITS IN BARMM”**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The First 1000 days of life refers from the start of the conception up to 9 months which is composed of 270 days, baby’s first year at (365) days, till its second year for 365 days. The early childhood and early childhood nutrition, were often referred to the first 1000 days. A mother’s nutrition during pregnancy and the nutrition a child receives in the first two years of life are vitally important which influences in the determination of good health both now and into the future. These first 1000 days of life set us up for good health across our lives. Ensuring babies have the right mix of nutrients in their first 1000 days helps them to better resist infections and allows their growing brains and bodies to realise their full development.

Results of the 2015 National Nutrition Survey in BARMM showed a 45.2% or 5 out of 10 under five children are stunted compared to national data of 33% , while 93% among 6-23 months children failed to meet the minimum acceptable diet, we have 19.5% nutritionally at risk pregnant women versus national with 24.5% respectively. With this very high prevalence BARMM was included in the priority areas for targeting in the Philippine Plan of Action for Nutrition (PPAN) 2017-2022. Mobilization will aim to transform low-intensity nutrition programs to those that will deliver targeted outcomes. It will involve capacity building and mentoring of LGUs on nutrition program management to transform them to self-propelling LGUs able to plan, implement, coordinate, and monitor and evaluate effective nutrition programs. This strategy is also expected to complement the interventions in the first 1000 days.

The Philippine economy lost a total of Php 328 billion in 2013 due to the impact of child stunting on education and productivity, equivalent to 2.84 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.$^1$ The cost covers grade-level repetition based on the Department of Education data and productivity loss due to low grade level achievement or premature deaths among economically active adults. The estimate of Save the Children, while higher than the estimate of the UNICEF study, is consistent. The latter study estimated about USD 3.99 billion annual cost of the status quo of nutrition programming in the Philippines

The first 1000 days of life refer to the period of pregnancy up to the first two years of the child. This is the period during which key health, nutrition, early education and related services should be delivered to ensure the optimum physical and mental development of the child. This is also the period during which poor nutrition can have irreversible effects on the physical and mental development of the child, consequences of which are felt way into adulthood.

Effects of stunting were impaired growth has adverse functional consequences on the child. Some of those consequences include poor cognition and educational performance, low adult wages, lost productivity and, when accompanied by excessive weight gain later in childhood, an increased risk of nutrition-related chronic diseases in adult life, which is irreversible.

Thus, this resolution urged the Ministry of the Interior and Local Government for the implementation of the Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD) in the First 1000 days (F1KD) in all Local Government Units in BARMM.
