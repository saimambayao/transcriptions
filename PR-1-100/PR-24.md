**A RESOLUTION**
**URGING THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MINISTER (OCM) AND THE MIMNISTRY OF BASIC, HIGHER, AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION (MBHTE) TO DEVISE A MECHANISM THAT WILL INCENTIVIZE FAMILIES WITH AT LEAST THREE (3) HIGH SCHOOL AND/OR COLLEGE STUDENTS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE COMPLETION OF THE STUDENTS’ SCHOOLING**

**WHEREAS,** Article IX of R.A. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) enumerates the basic rights of the Bangsamoro. As part of social justice, Section 8 provides, in part, that the Bangsamoro Government shall provide, maintain, and ensure the delivery of basic and responsive quality education;

**WHEREAS,** according to the World Bank in its article titled “*Unlocking the Potential of the Bangsamoro People through the Alternative Learning System*,” in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), only one (1) in every 10 students who began primary education completes their junior high school (JHS) education on time. Moreover, out-of-school youth and adults have accumulated over the decades, with their percentage being 45%, which is double the national average¹;

**WHEREAS,** in June of 2021, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) assisted 17 private higher education institutions (HEIs) in the BARMM to be included in the CHED Registry to benefit from the programs under R.A. 10931, or the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Law. According to CHED Chairman Popoy De Vera, BARMM still has the highest poverty incidence across all regions, which was even more worsened by the pandemic. This led the CHED to assist the 17 HEIs to be qualified in the validation for Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES) beneficiaries. Chairman De Vera stated that access to free and quality tertiary education will continue to be offered for disadvantaged Filipino students by giving them additional funds that will help them cope with the pandemic and cover not just their educational needs but also their living expenses²;

**WHEREAS,** according to the CHED, for Academic Year (A.Y.) 2020-2021, more than 42,709 students in state universities and colleges in the BARMM are benefiting from free higher education. Moreover, in the first year of implementation of the TES Program in A.Y. 2018-2019, 10,965 TES grantees were registered both for public and private HEIs in the region. In A.Y. 2019-2020, the number increased to 17,967 and in A.Y. 2021-2022, the numbers have leaped to 19,876³;

**WHEREAS,** there is a need to strengthen the delivery of secondary and tertiary education in the BARMM;

**WHEREAS,** sending students to school should be seen as an opportunity and not an additional burden for Bangsamoro families;

**WHEREAS,** keeping students in school should be a top priority in the BARMM;

**WHEREAS,** government assistance through CHED has been given to HEIs and more and more grantees for subsidies have been recorded for the past three academic years from 2019 to 2022. Furthermore, several other scholarship grants are being given by the government;

**WHEREAS,** other than scholarships and subsidies, to keep students in school and to attract families to keep on sending their family members to school, the OCM and the MBHTE should work together to provide more opportunities for families to keep students in school. Thus, the said offices should devise a mechanism to incentivize families with at least three (3) students who are in their secondary or tertiary education;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED,** by the BTA Parliament, to pass and approve this resolution urging OCM and the MBHTE to devise a mechanism that will incentivize families with at least (3) high school and/or college students, in order to ensure the completion of the students’ schooling.

Adopted,
