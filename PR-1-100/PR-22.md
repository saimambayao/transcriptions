**RESOLUTION**
**ENCOURAGING THE MINISTRY OF BASIC, HIGHER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION (MBHTE) TO CONSIDER THE PROVISION OF FREE HYGIENE KITS, ESPECIALLY FREE SANITARY NAPKINS IN ALL PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL COMFORT ROOMS WITHIN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM)**

**WHEREAS,** Section 3, Article V of R.A. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants;

**WHEREAS,** Section 8, Article IX of the BOL provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall provide, maintain, and ensure the delivery of basic and responsive health programs, quality education, appropriate services, livelihood opportunities, affordable and progressive housing projects, power and electricity, and water inhabitants of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS,** Section 22, Article IX of the BOL also provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. It shall also uphold the peoples' right to have access to essential goods, and other social services that promote their well-being;

**WHEREAS,** we face a global phenomenon called “*period poverty*”. According to Medical News Today, it is defined as a lack of access to menstrual products, education, hygiene facilities, waste management, or a combination of these. It affects an estimated 500 million people worldwide¹;

**WHEREAS,** included in the 12-point priority agenda of the MBHTE is the creation of comprehensive health and nutrition programs in school;

**WHEREAS,** public school toilets, apart from stocking products, such as toilet paper, soap, and paper towels, should also provide another basic necessity – menstrual products²;

**WHEREAS,** menstruation is unpredictable and students may not have menstrual hygiene products on hand while in school. This can lead to leaving school early or absences in many young teens due to the lack of access to menstrual products;

**WHEREAS,** creating ease of access to free menstrual and hygiene products can ensure a healthy and enabling learning environment for the students to reach their maximum potential. It can increase their confidence, and improve their health and well-being outcomes, since lack of access to these products can frustrate their ability to participate fully in their educational opportunities including co-curricular activities;

**WHERAS,** having the provision of free menstrual products in every public school comfort room will ensure that every menstruating student gets access to sanitary pads easily. This is not only a provision of a basic need but a resolution of an issue of economics, equity, and basic needs are also being met³;

**WHEREAS,** sanitation and hygiene are crucial in menstrual hygiene management among girls. Poor hygiene during menstruation creates a perfect environment for bacteria to proliferate which may lead to bacterial infection, which will eventually lead to poor performance of students in their studies;

**WHEREAS,** in addition, by providing such, the students can manage their menstrual hygiene with dignity;

**WHEREAS,** in furtherance of the mandate of MBHTE in creating comprehensive health programs for the students, it is imperative for the said ministry to create a plan to provide free menstrual hygiene products in all public school comfort rooms and to continue offering them to students.

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED,** by the BTA Parliament, to pass and approve this Resolution encouraging the MBHTE to consider the provision of free hygiene kits, especially free sanitary napkins, in all public high school comfort rooms within the BARMM.

**Adopted,**
