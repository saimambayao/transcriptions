WHEREAS, Section 6, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution mandates that the Supreme Court shall have administrative supervision over all Courts and the personnel thereof;

WHEREAS, the Supreme Court of the Philippines, the Constitutional repository of judicial power and administration of all Courts including the Shari’ah Courts and having the duty and power to pursue its constitutional missions and ideals through the granting of ten (10) years moratorium on the implementation of the qualifications of judges of Shari’ah Courts as stated in the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL);

WHEREAS, the above-mentioned qualifications of the Shari’ah Judges could have been hardly met by the Bangsamoro professionals.

WHEREAS, according to our recent survey, the ten (10) years moratorium on the implementation of the qualifications of judges of the Shari’ah Courts as stated earlier is an essential element for the administration of justice, otherwise the Shari’ah Courts existing within and outside the core territory of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), created pursuant to PD 1083 or known as Code of Muslim personal Laws of the Philippines will die a natural death;

WHEREAS, while it is true that there are some qualified Muslim professionals who have possessed the said qualifications of Shari’ah Judges as stipulated on the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), they are not interested on the said position for unknown reason;

WHEREAS, in order to preserve the gains of the peace process between the Government of the Philippines (GPH) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), which includes the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), it is necessary and indispensable that the qualifications of the Shari’ah Judges be in accordance with Articles 140 and 152 respectively of the PD 1083, otherwise known as the Code of Muslim Personal Laws of the Philippines which unequivocally states;

Article 140. Qualifications- No person shall be appointed Shari’ah District Judge unless, in addition to the qualifications for judges of Courts of first instant fixed in the Judiciary Law, he is learned in Islamic Jurisprudence.

Article 152. Qualifications- No person shall be appointed judge of the Shari’ah Circuit Court unless he is a natural born citizen of the Philippines, at least twenty-five years of age, and has passed as examination in the Shari’ah and Islamic Jurisprudence (fiqh) to be given by the Supreme Court for admission to special membership in the Philippine Bar to practice in the Shari’ah Courts.

WHEREAS, it is strongly believed that Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is considered the best agreement ever had reached by the Bangsamoro people;

WHEREAS, the purpose of this Organic Law is to establish a political entity, provide for its basic structure of government in recognition of the justness and legitimacy of the cause of the Bangsamoro people and the aspirations of Muslim Filipinos and all indigenous cultural communities in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to secure their identity and posterity, allowing for meaningful self-government within the framework of the constitution and the national sovereignty as well as territorial integrity of the Republic of the Philippines;

WHEREAS, it is also believed that the grant of ten (10) years moratorium on the application of the qualifications of the Shari’ah Judges on the Republic Act 11054, known as the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region will build up the confident and sincerity of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines on the implementation of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL);

WHEREAS, this request for a moratorium is also consistent with the spirit of this stipulation in the pertinent article and section of the BOL (Article X, Sec. 8, last sentence): “The Supreme Court may grant the incumbent Shari’ah District and Circuit Court judges who are not regular members of the Philippine Bar a reasonable period within which to qualify, pending which they shall be allowed to continue discharging their duties.”

NOW, THEREFORE, be it resolved and it is hereby resolved, to respectfully request the Supreme Court of the Philippines for the ten (10) years moratorium on the application of the Shari’ah Judges on the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL).

IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED FURTHER that this resolution will be submitted to the Office of the Chief of Justice, Supreme Court of the Philippines.
