**RESOLUTION CONDEMNING THE BRUTAL KILLING OF FORMER BARANGAY CHAIRMAN OF DALICAN, DATU ODIN SINSUAT, DATU JAMAEL Q. SINSUAT, SR. AND CALLING ON THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION TO IMMEDIATELY CONDUCT AN INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL INVESTIGATION TO BRING THE PERPETRATORS AND THE MASTERMIND TO THE BAR OF JUSTICE**

**WHEREAS,** on September 30, 2022, just after the Friday Jumu'ah Prayer, within the vicinity of a Mosque located in Barangay Dalican, Datu Odin Sinsuat Municipality, Datu Jamael Q. Sinsuat, Sr. was treacherously shot to death by an unidentified gunman;

**WHEREAS,** according to the Philippine National Police (PNP), "the victim had just stepped out of the gate of the mosque compound and was about to board his vehicle after attending the Friday prayers when a gunman shot him from across the road. The victim's security escorts fired back at the gunman, killing him"$^1$. The manner of killing was not only brazen but also a blatant desecration to the sanctity of places of worship;

**WHEREAS,** the killing of Datu Jamael Q. Sinsuat, Sr. along the vicinity of a mosque only shows that the perpetrators have no fear of Allah nor have they any iota of respect in a place of worship. They will surely reap the wrath of Allah SWT in this pronouncement: "Whoever kills a soul unless for a soul is as if he had slain mankind entirely";

**WHEREAS,** Datu Jamael Q. Sinsuat, Sr. was the official mayoralty candidate of the United Bangsamoro Justice Party (UBJP) in the last May 9, 2022 local election for the Municipality of Datu Odin Sinsuat, Province of Maguindanao. As a standard bearer of UBJP, Datu Jamael Q. Sinsuat, Sr., boldly carried the torch for political reforms and moral governance in his own hometown and paid the highest price for such a noble cause;

**WHEREAS,** the criminal act happened where the PNP Municipal Office is just a few meters away and the Municipal Hall is just a few steps away;

**WHEREAS,** the UBJP Vice Chairman issued a Statement on September 30, 2022 requesting that the incumbent Chief of Police of the Municipality of Datu Odin Sinsuat, Maguindanao be immediately relieved for his dismal failure to maintain the peace and order in the Municipality as his area of responsibility;

**WHEREAS,** on October 1, 2022, PNP Police Regional Office - BARMM issued Special Order No. 430 effectively relieving the former Chief of Police of said municipality, and naming the Officer-in-Charge on the same date;

**WHEREAS,** to avoid a possible miscarriage of justice, there is a need to invite the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to conduct an independent and fair investigation on the motive, identity and factual circumstances surrounding the killing of Datu Jamael Q. Sinsuat, Sr., and consequently file the appropriate criminal charges against the perpetrators, conspirators and, especially, the mastermind of this dastardly and cowardly act;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,** as it is hereby RESOLVED by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao:

1. To condemn in the strongest terms the brutal killing of Datu Jamael Q. Sinsuat, Sr.; and
2. To call upon the NBI to handle the investigation of the case.

Let a copy of this Resolution be furnished to the NBI for its consideration and appropriate action.

**Adopted, ________ October 2022.**
