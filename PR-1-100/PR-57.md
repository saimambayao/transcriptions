**“A RESOLUTION URGING THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH TO CONDUCT FEASIBILITY STUDY ON THE POSSIBLE PROCUREMENT AND ACQUISITION OF LOW COST HIGH EFFICIENT OXYGEN GENERATOR AMONG THE 27 HOSPITALS OF BARMM”**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

*“Additional healthcare facilities are one of the most critical needs of the hour”.*
- *Reliance Foundation*

*“Health is a state of complete mental, social, and physical well-being, not merely the absence of disease or infirmity”.*
- *World Health Organisation*

Oxygen is an essential medicine used to care for patients at all levels of the healthcare system, including in surgery, trauma, heart failure, asthma, pneumonia and maternal and child care. Pneumonia alone accounts for 800,000 deaths per year. It is estimated that 20–40% of these deaths could be prevented with the availability of oxygen therapy.

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated global demand for oxygen and made the delivery of oxygen supplies more urgent than ever. The need for oxygen has increased to 1.1 million cylinders in low to middle-income countries alone. 40% of these deaths could be prevented with the availability of oxygen therapy.$^1$

Oxygen is a life-saving essential medicine with no substitution. Healthcare professionals use oxygen to treat respiratory illnesses like COVID-19 and pneumonia. Oxygen is also essential for surgery and trauma. Vulnerable groups like the elderly, pregnant women and newborns need oxygen therapy on a regular basis.

Despite being an essential medicine, oxygen is a complex product. It needs to be produced by a medical device or Industrial plant. Oxygen also requires a whole system to safely reach patients.

Due to their complexity, access to oxygen meets many challenges: availability, quality, affordability, management, supply, human resources capacity and safety. In face of these challenges, the WHO continuously recommends to develop resources and tools to overcome them.$^2$ While it is a fact that most hospitals in BARMM are in Geographically Isolated and Disadvantaged Area (GIDA) and are difficult to access due to security and transportation issues, it is therefore mandatory to acquire a low cost, friendly and efficient oxygen generator, after a comprehensive feasibility study is conducted. To supply the 27 hospitals with a secure and constant source of onsite medical grade oxygen making the lifesaving element immediately available when needed.

Oxygen Generator is an equipment that provides a safe, efficient, low-cost solution to the high-cost of cryo-oxygen delivery and oxygen cylinder filling and a solution to shortages of oxygen tank deliveries considering multiple factors involved.

Finally, not a single Level 1 hospital in BARMM has an installed oxygen generator. Therefore the resolution urgently seeks the passage for implementation.
