**A RESOLUTION RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING THE PHILIPPINE CONGRESS TO CREATE A LONE CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF COTABATO CITY**

**WHEREAS,** Article VI, Section 5 (1) of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides that *"The House of Representatives shall be composed of not more than two hundred and fifty members, unless otherwise fixed by law, who shall be elected from legislative districts apportioned among the provinces, cities, and the Metropolitan Manila area in accordance with the number of their respective inhabitants, and on the basis of a uniform and progressive ratio, and those who, as provided by law, shall be elected through a party-list system of registered national, regional, and sectoral parties or organizations"*;

**WHEREAS,** Article VI, Section 5 (3) of the 1987 Philippine Constitution states, *"Each legislative district shall comprise, as far as practicable, contiguous, compact, and adjacent territory. Each city with a population of at least two hundred fifty thousand, or each province, shall have at least one representative"*;

**WHEREAS,** Article VI, Section 5 (4) of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides that *"Within three years following the return of every census, the Congress shall make a reapportionment of legislative districts based on the standards provided in this section"*;

**WHEREAS,** The aforementioned Philippine Constitution makes it very clear that the fundamental principle of equality of representation, which is a crucial component of patriotism, acts as the driving factor behind the rule of appointment;

**WHEREAS,** Cotabato City was the capital of the Sultanate of Maguindanao, which fought against Spain, the United States, and Japan;

**WHEREAS,** on June 20, 1959, Cotabato City was officially created as a chartered city by virtue of Republic Act No. 2364, and on July 10, 1959, it became a city.

**WHEREAS,** Section 9. R.A. 11550 states that Cotabato City is only part of the lone legislative district of the Province of Maguindanao del Norte;

**WHEREAS,** Cotabato City was formerly a part and the Regional Center of Region XII, but due to the ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law, it is now part of Bangsamoro and serves as the regional center. Being an independent component city, it is not subject to regulation from the Provincial Government of Maguindanao, where it is geographically located;

**WHEREAS,** the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) lists Cotabato City as statistically independent;

**WHEREAS,** the 2020 census conducted by the Philippine Statistic Authority showed that Cotabato City had a total population of 325,079. This population meets the required number of at least 250,000 people to create a lone district;

**WHEREAS,** the population of Cotabato City will increase by 3,900 persons annually and is projected to double by the year 2029 if the population growth rate (2.38 percent) will not change within the said period;

**WHEREAS,** the commercial and business centers, such as malls and renowned restaurants, are gradually growing due to the city’s rapid economic growth and the influx of investors. These developments contribute to the city’s continued economic development, which creates employment for Cotabateños;

**WHEREAS,** the place is booming and transforming into a modern cosmopolitan city. The famous and historic Pedro Carolina Hill, or PC Hill, overlooking the city has been transformed into a colorful and fascinating attraction similar to the one in La Trinidad, Benguet, which was painted as an outdoor mural by Davies Paints. This spot is a must-see, especially for those looking to take memorable pictures. One of the tourist spots that are located in the city is the Kalanganan Baywalk. It is constantly improving, like the Manila Baywalk. With its instagrammable appearance, Kalanganan Baywalk is best for relaxation, family bonding, and also brisk walking along the baywalk is very satisfying while waiting for the sunset.

**WHEREAS,** with a lone congressional district representation in the House of Representatives, the voice of the Cotabateños will be heard in a broader arena, access to the development will be reached, and the people will tremendously benefit from it as it will result in rapid growth or progress of the city;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT HEREBY RESOLVED,** by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority:

**TO PASS AND APPROVE THIS RESOLUTION URGING THE PHILIPPINE CONGRESS TO CREATE A LONE CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF COTABATO CITY**

Adopted, ________________________
