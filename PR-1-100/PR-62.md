**WHEREAS**, on October 26, 2020, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) Government launched its Marawi Rehabilitation Program (MRP) which has an allotted ₱500-million fund as part of its continuous intervention to expedite the recovery, reconstruction, and rehabilitation of Marawi City;

**WHEREAS**, the Marawi Rehabilitation Program encompasses all of the BARMM’s plans and actions for the Marawi City’s Rehabilitation which are based on the approved committee report made by the Bangsamoro Transitions Authority’s (BTA) Special Committee on Marawi (SCM).;

**WHEREAS**, the allotted fund can be accessed after the program steering committee (PSC) under Chief Minister office approves project proposals submitted by Bangsamoro ministries, line agencies, and offices in charge of rehabilitation;

**WHEREAS**, the Project Steering Committee (PSC) serves as the key policy-making and oversight body of the BARMM-MRP, which covers all BARMM-funded and initiated projects and activities for the people and places affected by the Marawi siege;

**WHEREAS**, Administrative Order No. 0007 of the Office of Chief Minister orders the establishment of BARMM-Marawi Rehabilitation Program Project Management Office (BARMM-MRP PMO) who will be responsible for the technical, operational, and financial management of the program as well as for the provision of administrative support to the PSC;

**WHEREAS**, the formulation of the numerous programs of the BARMM-MRP PMO were founded on the issues and concerns raised by the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) during the series of public consultations conducted in the years 2018 and 2019;

**WHEREAS**, these issues and concerns were consolidated in the Committee Report No. 35 of the Special Committee on Marawi (SCM);

**WHEREAS**, some of these programs were already implemented like the Bangsamoro Sagip Kabuhayan (BSK) and others;

**WHEREAS**, on September 27, 2022, the Office of the BTA Parliament Member Atty. Rasol Yap Mitmug, Jr. conducted a Town Hall Meeting (Information Drive) in the City of Marawi;

**WHEREAS**, the said event was attended by different individuals who are residents of Marawi City and other Municipalities of Lanao del Sur; some of the attendees are librarian, health workers, teachers, MSU students, and members of CSO’s who are also IDP’s;

**WHEREAS**, during the said Town Hall Meeting, one of the attendees who is an IDP, shared that his father is one of the selected beneficiaries of the SAGIP KABUHAYAN PROGRAM, who should have been a recipient of a P15,000.00 worth amount of money capital for livelihood but unfortunately, he never received the said amount;

**WHEREAS**, he further alleged that there were anomalies in the selection of the beneficiaries of BSK as there were special slots given to certain Barangay Chairpersons in Most Affected Areas (MAA);

**WHEREAS**, another IDP who was also present during the meeting, claimed that some of the Marawi Rehabilitation Programs do not directly cater to the needs of the IDP’s and that there is a need to assess the BARMM-MRP PMO programs because she noticed that some of the MRP Programs are overlapping with some of the programs of national government’s Task Force Bangon Marawi (TFBM);

**WHEREAS**, through assessment by consultation, the BARMM – MRP PMO may have the opportunity to scrutinize the implementation of its existing programs, verify the alleged anomalies, and modify the system of its programs to meet the primary needs of the IDP’s;

**NOW, THEREFORE**, be it resolved as it is hereby **RESOLVED** by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to **urge the MARAWI REHABILITATION PROGRAM PROJECT MANAGEMENT OFFICE (MRP – PMO) to assess its existing programs by conducting a public consultation with the Internally Displaced Persons (IDP’s) of Marawi City.**
