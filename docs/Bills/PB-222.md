**AN ACT GIVING RECOGNITION AND INCENTIVES TO RESIDENT BANGSAMORO TOPNOTCHERS AND LEARNING INSTITUTIONS WITHIN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Achieving academic excellence for the sake of Allah (SWT) is a form of worship. As mentioned in Usool Al-deen Al-Islami by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem Al-Tuwayjri, Islam calls us to learn all kinds of beneficial knowledge. Branches of knowledge vary in status, the highest of which is knowledge of sharee’ah, then knowledge of medicine, then the other fields of knowledge.

A person seeking knowledge must pour enormous amount of time, effort, and resources to excel in his/her chosen field or profession. National licensure examinations are placed to test a person’s mastery over his chosen field and grant them the license and authority to practice such profession. Every aspiring professional’s dream is to pass the licensure examinations.

In every national licensure examination, topnotchers are recognized for posting the highest scores among all examinees. Only those who have strived hard and blessed by the Almighty are destined to take this precious recognition in the academic world. Indeed, topnotchers are sources of inspiration and strength, especially to the Bangsamoro youth. To strive for greatness, one must work hard, maintain focus, and bolster his faith and belief to Allah (SWT).

The achievements of these topnotchers are worthy of our recognition. They deserve our admiration for bringing pride, glory, and honor to the Bangsamoro. In fact, the Bangsamoro Parliament passed several resolutions recognizing the achievement of Bangsamoro Topnotchers is the past. But, although such resolutions are very much appreciated by these individuals, we believe that they deserve more from the Bangsamoro government considering the weight of their achievements and its positive impact to the Bangsamoro.

Hence, to give recognition worthy of the achievements of these Bangsamoro Topnotchers and Learning Institutions in the region, it is earnestly sought that this bill be enacted.
