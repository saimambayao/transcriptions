**AN ACT**
**REMOVING THE "NONE OF THE ABOVE" (NOTA) OPTION FROM THE OFFICIAL BALLOT IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION, AMENDING FOR THE PURPOSE SECTION 14, ARTICLE VII OF BANGSAMORO AUTONOMY ACT NO. 35, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE "BANGSAMORO ELECTORAL CODE OF 2023"**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Bangsamoro Autonomy Act (BAA) No. 35, otherwise known as the *Bangsamoro Electoral Code of 2023*, was enacted by the Bangsamoro Parliament on March 8, 2023. This law prescribes the structural, functional, and procedural principles governing the conduct of elections, plebiscites, initiatives, referenda, and recall proceedings, and promotes the formation of genuinely principled political parties in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).

Section 14, Article VII of the said law provides for the inclusion of the names of all candidates, their photo/logo, and a "None of the Above" (NOTA) option in the official ballot. However, if left unamended, this provision may result in the possibility of unfilled seats in the Bangsamoro Government during the first Parliamentary Elections in the Bangsamoro on October 13, 2025.

The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) has urged the Bangsamoro Parliament to amend the Bangsamoro Electoral Code, particularly the NOTA provision. Under the existing law, if the NOTA or abstain vote garners the majority, the candidate placing second shall be proclaimed as the winner. Constitutionally, however, the proclamation of a second-place candidate is impermissible, as categorically ruled by the Supreme Court in *Datu Pax Ali Mangudadatu v. Commission on Elections* (G.R. Nos. 260219 & 260231, June 2025).

This bill therefore seeks to amend Section 14, Article VII of the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 35, or the *Bangsamoro Electoral Code of 2023*, by removing the NOTA option from the official ballot.

In view of the foregoing, the immediate passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
