**AN ACT GRANTING SPECIAL HARDSHIP ALLOWANCE FOR PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS IN THE ISLAND PROVINCES OF BASILAN, SULU, AND TAWI-TAWI AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREOF**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Public school teachers play a fundamental role in society as they shape the lives of the Bangsamoro learners and mold the thinkers of tomorrow. Their dedication in educating students is crucial for societal progress of the island provinces of Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi. However, their work is often challenged by a range of hardships that stem from geographic isolation, lack of resources, and socio-economic constraints even to the extent of risking their own lives.

This proposed measure seeks to recognize the dedication of public school teachers in educating Bangsamoro students by institutionalizing the grant of special hardship allowance to all covered public school teachers serving in far-flung areas and remote islands in the provinces of Basilan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi. This bill aims to acknowledge the heroism of public school teachers by providing them the compensation they deserve.

To support them effectively, the government must invest more in infrastructure, provide adequate allowances, and create policies that prioritize the well-being and development of educators in remote regions. Let us not deprive our public school teachers of this benefit by considering the passing of this bill at the earliest possible time.
