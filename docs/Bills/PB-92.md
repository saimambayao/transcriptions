**AN ACT**
**CREATING THE BANGSAMORO HOUSING OFFICE, DEFINING ITS MANDATES, POWERS AND FUNCTIONS, AND PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**Explanatory Note**

The importance of housing to a person remains an indisputable fact. Housing is a basic need of every human being, just as food and clothing. It is fundamental to the well-being, continued existence, and health of a person.

Home ownership brings a sense of being as to where one belongs. Housing is key to the indispensable right of the Bangsamoro people to self-determination and in ensuring the long-term development of the Bangsamoro Region.

Article 25 (1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) states that:

"Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and his family. The right to an adequate standard of living requires, at a minimum, that everyone shall enjoy the necessary subsistence rights, adequate food and nutrition, clothing, and housing. As a universal economic, social, and cultural right, the right to adequate housing guarantees the right to live in security, peace, and dignity."

The same principle is infused in no less that our own 1987 Philippine Constitution, under Article XIII, Section 9, provides that:

The State shall, by law, and for the common good, undertake, in cooperation with the private sector, a continuing program of urban land reform and housing which will make available at affordable cost, decent housing and basic services to underprivileged and homeless citizens in urban centers and resettlement areas.

Moreover, as provided under the International standards: *International rapporteur on the right to adequate housing* of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), to be defined as ‘adequate’, housing should meet seven minimum criteria, namely:

1) accessibility;
2) affordability;
3) habitability;
4) security of tenure;
5) cultural adequacy;
6) suitability of location; and
7) access to essential services such as health and education.

In the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), there is a housing crisis with issues on housing affordability, accessibility, safety, and access to essential services, such as water, electricity, sanitation, health care, and education. According to data from the Ministry of Human Settlements and Development (MHSD), as of 2015, the region’s housing backlog is an estimated 68,250 units. From this figure, the table below shows the housing backlog per province:

| PROVINCE | HOUSING BACKLOG | PERCENTAGE |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Lanao del Sur | 39,426 | 57.77% |
| Tawi-Tawi | 10,416 | 15.26% |
| Maguindanao | 9,194 | 13.47% |
| Sulu | 6,265 | 9.18% |
| Basilan | 2,949 | 4.32% |
| **Total** | **62,850** | **100%** |

Note that these figures do not include new housing losses caused by both natural and man-made disasters from 2015 onwards.

The Philippines ranked third in the 2018 World Risk Index of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. It is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, where the majority of the world’s earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur. Its islands are regularly impacted by floods, typhoons, landslides, and droughts. More than these natural calamities, the Mindanao region is also affected by conflict and instability that have left thousands of people living in protracted displacement for over decades. These occurrences displace millions of Filipinos, including Bangsamoro citizens every year. The effects of the housing crisis became worse during the pandemic when a significant number of the BARMM’s population lost their jobs and means of livelihood because of induced lockdowns and stringent quarantines.

Data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) shows that as of December 2021, an estimated 203,940 families, or approximately 805,096 individuals, were displaced in Mindanao. Around 115,241 of this number are from the Bangsamoro region. Going on, the BARMM has the highest number of people displaced by armed conflict, crime, and violence in the Philippines. The majority of the displaced people are from the Province of Lanao del Sur, Marawi City in particular, following the Marawi Siege in 2017. The intense fighting and aerial bombing, which lasted for five months, has led to a massive humanitarian crisis, displacing approximately 300,000 people and ultimately leaving many of them homeless. The siege in Marawi City also forcefully moved many Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) to Iligan, Cagayan de Oro, and other areas outside BARMM. Five years after the siege, the displaced population remain to be in various transitory arrangements, with only a limited number of permanent shelters built. As of November 2021, around 17,060 families, or approximately 87,230 individuals, belonging to the most affected areas, remain displaced in various places. As per Task Force Bangon Marawi shared report, 4,214 families (approximately 21,060 individuals) are scattered in various transitory sites. Smaller displacements are also ongoing in Maguindanao, North Cotabato, and the island provinces.

The housing issues faced by the BARMM do not occur in a vacuum and are deep-rooted in its history. The 2014 GPH-MILF Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro acknowledges how historical injustices, human rights violations, and marginalization through land dispossession are root causes of the armed struggle waged by the Bangsamoro to assert their cultural identity and achieve meaningful self-determination. Colonial powers and the subsequent Philippine Central Government encouraged Christian families and former rebels from Luzon and Visayas to settle in Mindanao and gave them land titles in Bangsamoro communities. Thus, many Bangsamoro families were unjustly expelled from their lands and properties. Moving on to the present day, resulting and recurring cycles of displacement have pushed many Bangsamoro people to indigence. At present, the rising cost of land and construction materials have denied underprivileged sectors of the region of the chance to construct adequate housing.

However, despite the disheartening history of displacement of the Bangsamoro, it is worth noting that the Bangsamoro people also have various long-standing traditional practices around land and housing which ought to be considered in the context of cultural uniqueness. These include sea-dwelling ethnic groups who were born on the water and live on their boats, whose culture and livelihood are attached to the sea and stilt houses near fishing grounds. Others live on the shorelines of lakes, rivers, and marshlands. However, these customary practices are not always factored into national housing policy, which is a matter that ought to be considered.

Recognizing the urgency of the housing problem, *Republic Act No. 11054* or the *Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL)* has provided in its Article IX, Section 8 that:

"The Bangsamoro Government shall provide, maintain and ensure the delivery of xxx affordable and progressive housing projects xxx to the inhabitants of the Bangsamoro Region. It shall maintain appropriate disaster-preparedness units for immediate and effective relief services to victims of natural and man-made calamities. It shall also ensure the rehabilitation of calamity-affected areas and victims of calamities.

Also, Article IX, Section 9 provides that: [t]he Bangsamoro Government, in cooperation with the private sector, shall develop its own housing and human settlement programs. Section 1 of the same Article provides that the Bangsamoro Parliament, taking into account the report of the Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Commission, shall enact a transitional justice mechanism to address the legitimate grievances of the Bangsamoro People and the indigenous peoples, such as historical injustices, human rights violations, and marginalization through unjust dispossession of territorial and proprietary rights and customary land tenure. This complements the existing mandates of local government units (LGUs) on housing provision under the Local Government Code and the Urban Development and Housing Act (UDHA), among other relevant laws.

Under the BOL and Bangsamoro Autonomy Act (BAA) No. 13, or the Bangsamoro Administrative Code, the Ministry of Human Settlements and Development (MSHD) is mandated as the primary agency for the management of housing, human settlement, and urban development in the region. However, in practice, the implementation of housing projects is currently being done by various agencies such as MHSD, Ministry of Public Works (MPW), Ministry of Social Services and Development (MSSD), Ministry of Interior and Local Government (MILG)-Tugon, and the Office of the Chief Minister (OCM) - Kapayapaan sa Pamayanan (Kapyanan). To ensure efficiency in planning and delivery, the implementation of housing projects should ideally be concentrated rather than dispersed, hence, there is a pressing need to concentrate such efforts, resources, functions and activities in one regional housing agency to maximize results. As such, free housing being implemented by MSHD, MPW, MSSD, and the OCM shall be a temporary intervention intended to fill the compounded gaps brought about by decades of displacements of Bangsamoro people.

The creation of the Bangsamoro Housing Office (BHO) as an attached agency to the MHSD shall reinforce partnerships between the public and the private sectors and other stakeholders in addressing BARMM's housing gaps. The BHO shall use a holistic approach in solving the housing crisis of the Region. It shall maximize all efforts in involving financial institutions to provide the necessary funding, material builders to ensure resistance against natural disasters, and other relevant sectors to cater technical assistance and efficient land management.

The proposed Bangsamoro Housing Office shall be the primary mechanism of the Bangsamoro Government for both economic housing provision for moderately low-income households and social housing provision for underprivileged and internally displaced persons.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
