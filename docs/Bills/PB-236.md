**"AN ACT ESTABLISHING A GENERAL HOSPITAL WITH FIFTY BED CAPACITY IN COTABATO CITY TO BE KNOWN AS THE GHAZALI JAAFAR GENERAL HOSPITAL AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR"**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The 1987 Philippine Constitution, in Section 15, Article III declares that the State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. Section 11 Article XIII declares that the State shall adopt an integrated and comprehensive approach to health development that shall endeavor to make essential goods, health and other social services available to all the people at affordable cost.

Hospital is a place devoted primarily to the maintenance and operation of facilities for the diagnosis, treatment and care of individuals suffering from illness, disease, injury or deformity, or in need of obstetrical or other medical and nursing care. It is also the place where there are installed beds, or cribs, or bassinets for twenty-four-hour use or longer by patients in the treatment of diseases, diseased-conditions, injuries, deformities, or abnormal physical and mental states, maternity cases, and all institutions such as those for convalescence, sanitarial or sanitarial care, infirmities, nurseries, dispensaries and such other names by which they may designated.

Cotabato City is composed of 37 barangays with 325,079 total population. There are 4 hospitals located therein namely, Cotabato Puericulture Center and General Hospital Foundation with 30 bed capacity, Notre Dame Hospital with 40 bed capacity, Cotabato Regional and Medical Center (CRMC) with 600 bed capacity, and Eros Medical Clinic and Hospital with 18 bed capacity. Among the aforementioned hospitals, CRMC delivered services not only to those patients coming from Cotabato City but also in its adjacent province such such those coming from the Maguindanao del sur and Maguindanao del Norte.

Based on the standards set forth by the Department of Health, it provides that the ratio of bed capacity is 1 bed for every 1000 population. Applying such standards, the 325,079 population of Cotabato City needs at least 325 bed capacity. Considering that the service delivery areas of CRMC extend to those patients coming from some part of its adjacent provinces such as the Maguindanao Del Sur and Maguindanao Del Norte. Hence, only the 3 hospitals could accommodate its population having an aggregate bed capacity of 88. Therefore, there is a deficiency of at least 230 bed capacity in order to fully accommodate the populations of Cotabato City.

The establishment of a General Hospital with 50 bed capacity in the Cotabato City may serve primarily, but not limited to, the patients coming from the Cotabato City but also it may serve as an augmentation and support, when such need arises, to those coming from its nearby municipalities.

The hospital shall be named as Ghazali Jaafar Memorial Hospital in honor of the memory of Ghazali Jaafar who was the first Vice Chair of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). He also served as the first Chairman of the MILF Peace Panel and in fact was significantly instrumental in the drafting of what now became the Organic Law for the BARMM.

In view of the above, ensuring access to basic, quality and affordable medical services for Bangsamoro people must be given priority by the BARMM government. Essentially, this can be realized by establishing the general hospitals in identified strategic areas in BARMM, such as in Cotabato City.

Thus, in view of the foregoing, the immediate approval of this bill is earnestly sought.
