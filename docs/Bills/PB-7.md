**“An Act Strengthening Disaster Risk Reduction and Management in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, thereby Creating the Ministry of Disaster Resilience, Establishing its Powers and Jurisdictions, Providing Funds Thereof and for Other Purposes”**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is very vulnerable and prone to calamities, both natural and human-induced disasters. Based on the 2014 World Risk Report, the Philippines placed second in the World Risk Index. This can be attributed to an annual average of 20 typhoons, of which five (5) to nine (9) cause significant damage; 25 active volcanoes; earthquakes and landslide threats in the country, as well as human-induced disasters caused by the extremist militant groups such as the *Abu Sayaff Group (ASG)* and Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), among others, in the BARMM. The Marawi siege, as well as the BIFF and ASG’s intermittent attacks in some BARMM areas, are manifestations of these human-induced disasters.

This Act adopts the widely acceptable definition and frameworks of disaster resilience being used in the international and national arenas. *Disaster resilience is defined as the ability of individuals, communities, organisations and states to adapt to and recover from hazards, shocks or stresses without compromising long-term prospects for development.* Moreover, according to the *Hyogo Framework for Action (UNISDR, 2005)*, disaster resilience is determined by the degree to which individuals, communities, and public and private organisations are capable of organising themselves to learn from past disasters and reduce their risks to future ones, at international, regional, national and local levels.

This Act considers various studies and reviews on the Republic Act (RA) No. 10121 or the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management law such as the:

1) World Bank’s lessons learned from Yolanda, Recommendations from the Assessment Paper;
2) Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) research, titled “*Have we Institutionalized DRRM in the Philippines?*”; and
3) Disaster Risk Reduction Network Philippines (DRRNetPhils) Sunset Review on RA No. 10121.

The Sunset Review of the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management law, spearheaded by the Disaster Risk Reduction Network Philippines (DRRNetPhils), cited the following issues, namely, the presence of:

1) a fragmented structure, **no devoted and independent agency with full authority for disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM)**;
2) a gap in creating a fully functional local risk reduction and management (LRRM) Office;
3) a need to strengthen the capacities of local disaster risk reduction and management councils (LDRRMCs); and
4) a lack of awareness or have different understandings of disaster risk reduction/ climate change adaptation (DRR/CCA), leading to poor planning and implementation.

The World Bank cited the following recommendations in its assessment paper on the lessons learned from Yolanda:

1) **establish a more responsive National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Agency or Department**;
2) institutionalize a Disaster Rehabilitation and Recovery Framework;
3) institutionalize an effective coordination structure and mechanisms;
4) identify implementation modalities and strategies to speed up rehabilitation and recovery interventions;
5) develop an effective emergency procurement guide;
6) identify funding options for disaster rehabilitation and recovery; and
7) develop standards for disaster rehabilitation and recovery communications.

In the BARMM, the shift in the government system poses a challenge as to how it can systematically fit into the national structure, given that the latter follows the presidential form of government, whereas the BARMM follows the parliamentary system. As of this date, disaster risk reduction management in the Bangsamoro is still patterned from the national government, as seen in the Bangsamoro Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (BDRRMC), which is chaired by the Chief Minister.

the Bangsamoro Administrative Code, under Section 9, Title III, states that:

> ***Section 9. Bangsamoro Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council.*** – *The Bangsamoro Regional Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (Bangsamoro DRRMC) shall be chaired by the Chief Minister with the Minister of Ministry of Science and Technology as Vice-Chair for Disaster Mitigation and Prevention, the Minister of Ministry of Interior and Local Government (MILG) as Vice-Chair for Disaster Preparedness, the Minister of Ministry of Social Services and Development (MSSD) as Vice-Chair for Disaster Response, and the Bangsamoro Director-General of the Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority (BPDA) as Vice-Chair for Disaster Recovery and Rehabilitation. The Chief Minister shall identify the member-agencies of the Bangsamoro DRRMC (underscoring supplied).*

It is worth noting that in the cited provision, four (4) pillars of Bangsamoro risk reduction and management are mentioned, namely:

1) disaster mitigation & prevention,
2) preparedness,
3) response, and
4) recovery & rehabilitation.

On the other hand, Bangsamoro Administrative Code’s Section 26, Title VIII provides:

> ***Section 26. Rapid Emergency Action on Disaster Incidence Office.*** – *There shall be a Rapid Emergency Action of Disaster Incidence Office (READi) attached to the Ministry of the Interior and Local Government, that shall serve as executing office of the Bangsamoro Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (BDRRMC). The Bangsamoro READi shall also serve as the secretariat to the Bangsamoro DRRMC... x x x*”

As can be seen from these provisions, the structure alone poses a challenge to the BARMM’s disaster risk management for the following reasons:

a. **Fragmented interventions, no devoted ministry.** – Various ministries are in-charge of implementing disaster response, preparedness, prevention and mitigation, and rehabilitation and recovery programs, projects and activities. There is no devoted or focused ministry on disaster risk reduction and management working towards building disaster resilience in the Bangsamoro region;

b. **Incoherent structure.** – While the Chief Minister chairs the Bangsamoro DRRM Council, the BARMM-*READi*, which is the executing office of the Council, is lodged with the MILG. The Office of the Chief Minister, as Chair of the Bangsamoro DRRM Council, should have the operational control of the BARMM-*READi*, since the latter is the Secretariat of the Council. This would systematically link policymaking with operations;

c. **Duplication of functions.** – As mentioned above, the BARMM-*READi*, being the executing office of the Council, is attached to the MILG and not to the MSSD, which is the disaster response ministry. The response ministry cannot effectively and efficiently carry-out its mandate when there is a parallel ministry fulfilling its responsibility. There is a potential duplication of services in this situation;

d. **Weak DRMM structure and capacity.** – The programs for disaster risk reduction and management have in reality been merely for response, and little has been done to make it preventive or mitigative, or to develop more efficient and coordinated response actions. The other pillars of the DRRM are yet to be capacitated. Thus, there is an urgent need to strengthen and improve the functionality of the four (4) pillars of Bangsamoro DRRM, and establish a strong and devoted ministry that will work closely with the local government units;

e. **No updated DRRM plan and framework.** – There is no published updated DRRM plan and framework from the defunct ARMM in the current BARMM; and

f. **Absence of counterpart national agencies in the BARMM.** – Compounding the cited issues, some national agencies were either not devolved or had no counterpart in the BARMM, such as the Office of Civil Defense (OCD), the Climate Change Commission/Office (CCC/O); the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHILVOCS); and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA).

Moreover, the implementation of the peace agreement through the Bangsamoro Organic Law is a big opportunity for institution building. There is a potential to showcase the advantage of autonomy and a parliamentary system by creating its own structure that is peculiar to the Bangsamoro region’s situation. *It will be a pilot structure for disaster resilience in the country.* Considering that the BARMM is a disaster-prone region in which disasters are inevitable, adding one Ministry that caters to disaster resilience to the 15 existing ministries is a good investment. The Ministry shall be the very arm of the region in disaster risk reduction and management.
