**"AN ACT INSTITUTIONALIZING THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCE DIVISIONS AND GRANTING FISCAL AUTONOMY TO THE OFFICE FOR SETTLER COMMUNITIES (OSC), BANGSAMORO INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY OFFICE (BICTO), BANGSAMORO INFORMATION OFFICE (BIO), AND THE BANGSAMORO DARUL-IFTA' (BDI), AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES, AND PROVING FUNDS THEREFOR"**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is committed to building an efficient, transparent, and accountable government that responds effectively to the needs of its people. A key component of this commitment is the strengthening of institutional capacities within agencies under the **Office of the Chief Minister (OCM).**

There are currently **eleven (11)** offices directly under the OCM. Of these, **four (4)** have already been granted **fiscal autonomy**, empowering them to manage their resources more independently and efficiently. However, the remaining **five (5)**—including the **Office for Settler Communities (OSC), Bangsamoro Information and Communications Technology Office (BICTO), Bangsamoro Information Office (BIO), and the Bangsamoro Darul-Ifta' (BDI)**—have not yet been granted fiscal autonomy, and continue to rely on other OCM units for administrative and financial transactions. This dependency has often resulted in delays in program implementation, low budget utilization, and reduced efficiency in service delivery.

The **Office for Settler Communities (OSC)**, created under Section 35, C, Chapter 3, Title III of Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 13, is the primary agency tasked with promoting the welfare and addressing the concerns of settler communities in BARMM. However, the OSC currently operates without a dedicated **Administrative and Finance Division**, which hinders timely disbursement, procurement, and implementation of programs. The lack of direct fiscal control delays supplier payments, causes administrative bottlenecks, and limits the efficiency of its service delivery. The establishment of this division will significantly enhance its operational performance and allow the OSC to fully exercise its mandate while remaining under the supervision of the Office of the Chief Minister.

Similarly, the **Bangsamoro Information and Communications Technology Office (BICTO)** serves as BARMM’s policy, planning, coordinating, and implementing agency for ICT infrastructure and digital transformation. This measure proposes the creation of an **Administrative and Finance Division** to empower BICTO to efficiently manage resources and fulfill its role as the government’s digital governance arm. The grant of **fiscal autonomy** will enable BICTO to accelerate digital development programs across BARMM.

The **Bangsamoro Information Office (BIO)** plays a vital role in information dissemination, promoting transparency, public engagement, and accountability. As its responsibilities grow, a dedicated **Administrative and Finance Division** is crucial for managing resources, planning budgets, and supporting the delivery of consistent and professional communication across BARMM. The grant of **fiscal autonomy** will further strengthen BIO’s responsiveness and institutional capacity.

Finally, the **Bangsamoro Darul-Ifta' (BDI)**, as the primary institution for Islamic jurisprudence and guidance, also faces increasing demands in fulfilling its religious and advisory mandates. This proposed measure amends the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 13 to establish an **Administrative and Finance Division** within the BDI. This will strengthen its internal operations and allow it to function more efficiently in support of its spiritual mission.

This bill not only institutionalizes the **Administrative and Finance Divisions** across these four key agencies but also grants them **fiscal autonomy**, ensuring that funds are **automatically and regularly released, and are not reduced below the previous year’s appropriations.** Each Administrative and Finance Division will include standardized sections—such as **Supply and Property Procurement, Cash, Accounting, Budget, and Management and Audit**—to promote internal efficiency and compliance with Bangsamoro financial rules and regulations.

In view of the foregoing, the **immediate passage of this bill** is earnestly sought to equip these agencies with the structural and fiscal capacity needed to deliver effective, timely, and accountable services to the Bangsamoro people.
