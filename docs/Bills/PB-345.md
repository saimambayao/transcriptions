**AN ACT GRANTING CIVIL SERVICE ELIGIBILITY UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS TO BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES APPOINTED UNDER JOB ORDER, CONTRACT OF SERVICE, CASUAL OR CONTRACTUAL STATUS WHO HAVE RENDERED A TOTAL OF TEN (10) YEARS OF EFFICIENT SERVICE, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Bangsamoro Organic Law provides for the establishment of a civil service system in the Bangsamoro region, ensuring that recruitment, selection, and promotion within the region’s government are based on merit, fitness, and equal opportunity. This provision underlines the importance of improving employment conditions and career prospects for public servants, which aligns with the objectives of the proposed bill to provide civil service eligibility to long-serving employees in non-permanent positions.

This bill seeks to provide civil service eligibility to employees of the Bangsamoro government who are currently appointed under non-permanent employment statuses such as job order, contract of service, casual, or contractual positions. Specifically, the bill grants civil service eligibility to those who have rendered a total of ten (10) years of efficient service in any of these positions.

This bill recognizes the long-serving employees and their contributions to public service by providing them with more job security and career advancement within the government. Further, by granting eligibility, the bill seeks to strengthen the workforce in the Bangsamoro region, helping the Bangsamoro government to retain skilled and experienced personnel who are familiar with their roles and the specific needs of their community.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this bill is earnestly sought.
