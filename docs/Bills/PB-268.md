**AN ACT PROVIDING FOR THE HALAL CONSUMERS ACT**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The 2020-2022 Bangsamoro Regional Development Plan (BRDP) envisioned industry development in Bangsamoro where halal criteria is embedded in its process and system. Accordingly, halal principles will be integrated starting at the production level to the value-adding process. The National Government has also listed the Establishment of Halal Industry as one of its priority investment areas.

In light of the general policies and the economic goals of the country, this Halal Consumer’s Act for the Bangsamoro Region is being proposed in order to lay down the groundwork of establishing a halal industry in the country. The Bangsamoro Region should take precedence in leading the nation towards this pursuit as the Bangsamoro people has the greatest interest in promoting halal.

In the present, there are various agency issuances relating to halal but none of them provides penalty clauses for those that are arbitrarily using the halal seal without going through the process of certification There is also no active monitoring process for products that have undergone the procedure of halal certification. Thus, the enforcement of halal in the country is still loose as there are no existing mechanisms by which the agencies and private establishments can follow to regulate their sale of halal products and services.

This proposed legislation is, thus, being submitted to define the rights of the Bangsamoro people to consume halal. This proposal is a major breakthrough that wishes to expand the Consumer Act of the Philippines by defining the halal standards and the rights of the consumers to be protected from non-halal products.

Hence, its passage is earnestly sought.
