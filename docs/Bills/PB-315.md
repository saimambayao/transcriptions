**AN ACT INSTITUTIONALIZING THE USE OF “QUICK RESPONSE” (QR) CODES FOR ALL DOCUMENTS ISSUED BY BANGSAMORO MINISTRIES, OFFICES, AND AGENCIES, AND RECOGNIZING ALL PHOTOCOPIED DOCUMENTS BEARING THE QR CODE AS CERTIFIED TRUE AND CORRECT**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The use of “Quick Response” (QR) codes has become increasingly prevalent in modern society due to their efficiency and versatility. QR codes offer a seamless way to digitize information, enabling swift access to data through the use of smartphones or other electronic devices.

In the Philippines, QR codes have been utilized in various sectors, including transportation, retail, and healthcare, to streamline processes and enhance convenience. Some government agencies are utilizing QR codes for faster and more convenient service delivery. QR codes are used to access online government forms, verify IDs, and even pay for licenses and permits.

Section 16, Article II of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides that the State shall protect and advance the right of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology in accord with the rhythm and harmony of nature. Further, Section 3, Article V of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law provides for a similar provision which states that:

> “Section 3. General Welfare. The Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the … xx… enhancement of the right of the people to a balanced ecology … xx.”

In addition, the Bangsamoro Organic Law empowers the Bangsamoro Transition Authority to enact laws necessary for the efficient functioning of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. Furthermore, it aligns with existing national laws promoting the use of electronic documents and signatures, such as the Electronic Commerce Act of 2000.

The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is at a critical juncture, where the preservation of our environment and the promotion of sustainable practices are paramount. As we strive for progress and development, it is imperative that we also prioritize the conservation of our natural resources and the reduction of our carbon footprint.

By adopting QR codes for official documents, the Bangsamoro government seeks to align with this trend of technological advancement, ensuring that its services are efficient, accessible, and in line with global standards. Additionally, the commitment of the Bangsamoro government to environmental preservation is underscored by this bill. Digitizing documents and reducing the need for physical copies can significantly minimize paper consumption, thereby contributing to efforts aimed at conserving natural resources and reducing carbon emissions. Moreover, it promotes transparency and accountability by providing a secure and reliable means of verifying document authenticity.

As a region with unique governance structures and developmental goals, the adoption of QR codes for official documents will enhance administrative processes, improve service delivery, and contribute to the region’s overall progress and development.
