**AN ACT ESTABLISHING THE BANGSAMORO MUSEUM, PROVIDING FOR THE CREATION OF THE BANGSAMORO MUSEUM BOARD, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The history of the Bangsamoro Museum can be traced to 1977 when Regional Commissioner Simeon A. Datumanong issued an executive order creating the Regional Cultural Heritage Council. This was later replaced by the Regional Cultural Heritage Affairs Services (RCHAS) with the aim of preserving and promoting the cultural identity and history of Region XII.

When the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) was created by R.A. No. 6734, the RCHAS was again replaced by the Bureau on Cultural Heritage-ARMM. During these years, the National Museum of the Philippines created a branch in Cotabato City and exhibited several important and priceless artifacts, the most valuable of which are the 19 limestone burial jars. During the transition period from ARMM to Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), the National Museum left the care of the collections to the Bureau.

The Bangsamoro Museum was established on January 22, 2019 by virtue of Executive Order No. 32 issued by then ARMM Regional Governor Mujiv S. Hataman. The Museum holds valuable and priceless artifacts including 125 ethnographic specimens loaned by the National Museum. Most prominent and astonishing are the 19 limestone burial jars. On March 29, 2019, three months after the Executive Order was signed, the BARMM was inaugurated replacing the ARMM. Under R.A. No. 11054 (the Organic Law for the BARMM), the primary responsibility to establish museums has been conferred upon the Bangsamoro Commission for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage (BCPCH). Corollary thereto, Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 13 (BARMM Administrative Code) tasked the BCPCH to encourage and support the establishment of museums in the region. As it is, the BCPCH holds office at the Bangsamoro Museum but its organizational structure does not include an office or even a plantilla position that would manage the Museum and be accountable therefor. Considering the valuable properties under the custody of the Museum and the important role of the Museum in the preservation of artistic and cultural heritage of the Bangsamoro people, the establishment of the Bangsamoro Museum as an agency becomes vital.

In view of the foregoing, the immediate passage of this measure is earnestly requested.
