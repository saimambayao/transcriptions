**AN ACT**
**CREATING A BANGSAMORO COFFEE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE, AUTHORIZING THE APPROPRIATION OF FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Bangsamoro region is endowed with vast tracts of agricultural lands being harnessed for the production of food and commercial crops, including coffee. However, there is a diverse array of barriers that lead to impediments that constrain the development of the industry in the region, including low volume of production and low quality of coffee.

While the Department of Agriculture’s seeding program has had some successes in increasing input distribution, the quality of the plants can be substandard. With little formal training and education, coffee farms in the region continue to produce coffee with outdated agricultural techniques. Key operations for driving productivity and quality improvements in coffee production such as pruning, weeding, irrigation, fertilizer use, and tree replacement are sporadic and unevenly applied.

In addition, while there is government attention to the sector and cooperation within individual segments of the industry, communication often falters between the various offices. Although the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Trade and Industry have both issued separate road maps and planning documents for the industry, implementation of these strategies is uneven due to the autonomy of local governments to select which recommended initiatives to undertake.

Through this measure, an initial boost will be provided to coffee farmers with the creation of the Bangsamoro Coffee Research and Development Institute. This body will spearhead the provision of well-established extension packages among farmers, traders, and processors in the region. This includes inputs such as seedlings, fertilizer, and irrigation equipment as well as free training services in coffee production.

Extension services, access to quality seedlings, and access to credit are key elements for achieving the upgrade of the coffee industry. Extension services are essential in teaching small farmers about modern farming and harvesting techniques to increase their quality and yields, while access to credit is essential for small farmers to invest in new coffee plantations, and other inputs.

Furthermore, the government must provide market linkages and export support for smaller producers that are not yet in a position to engage directly with buyers. It must also play a strong role in branding the region’s coffee and engaging traders directly in a business-to-business model to promote the particular characteristics of our coffee.

We must recognize that the region has had a strong reputation for coffee. This needs to be further developed once the region has improved its production and processing techniques. However, these efforts need to be tailored to raise the profile of the region as a specialty producer, drawing buyers and roasters, and creating linkages between producing organizations and buyers.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
