**AN ACT DECLARING A TWO-DAY HOLIDAY DURING EID’L FITR IN THE BANGSAMORO REGION**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

“Sawm, fasting during the holy month of Ramadan, is the fourth pillar of Islam. Ordained in the Holy Qur'an, the fast is an act of deep personal worship in which Muslims seek a richer perception of God. Ramadhan, the month during which the Holy Qur'an was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad, begins with the sighting of the new moon, after which abstention from eating and drinking is obligatory from dawn to sunset. Ramadan is also a joyful month. Muslims break their fast at sunset with a special meal, iftar, perform additional nocturnal worship, tarawih, after evening prayer; and throng the streets in moods that are festive and communal. The end of Ramadan is observed by three days of celebration called Eid’l Fitr, the feast of the breaking of the fast. Customarily, **it is a time for family reunion** and the favored holiday for children who receive new clothing and gifts.”¹

The Bangsamoro Region is home to a significant Muslim population who observe the holy month of Ramadhan with reverence, devotion, and fasting. As part of religious customs, Muslims celebrate Eid’l Fitr, marking the end of Ramadhan, as one of the most important festivals in Islam.

Presidential Decree No. 1083 recognizes Eid’l Fitr as an official Muslim holiday in the Philippines. However, the declaration of Eid’l Fitr as a holiday is dependent on the moonsighting on the evening of the 29th day of Ramadhan, leading to instances where the celebration does not align with the national holiday declared by the government. This discrepancy poses challenges for employees who are mandated to report to their workplaces during Eid’l Fitr, thereby undermining the intent and effectiveness of the existing law. Thus, the submission of this bill.

Enshrined under Section 5, Article VII, of Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law, the Bangsamoro Parliament shall have the power to enact laws declaring Bangsamoro holidays.

Recognizing the cultural and religious significance of Ramadhan and Eid’l Fitr to the Muslim community in the Bangsamoro Region, the proposed bill seeks to address the issue by declaring the last day of Ramadhan and the first day of Shawal as special non-working holidays. By enacting this legislation, the Bangsamoro government will provide predictability and consistency in the celebration of Eid’l Fitr, ensuring that Muslim employees in the region can observe this important religious festival without hindrance or conflict with work obligations.

This bill underscores the government's commitment to respecting the religious diversity and practices of Muslims in the Bangsamoro Region, guaranteeing that their rights to observe and celebrate their religious traditions are upheld and protected.
