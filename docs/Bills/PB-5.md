**AN ACT**
**CREATING A SUB-DISTRICT ENGINEERING OFFICE FOR THE SPECIAL GEOGRAPHIC AREA (SGA) TO BE KNOWN AS THE SGA SUB-DISTRICT ENGINEERING OFFICE (SGA-SDEO), UNDER THE MAGUINDANAO 2ND DISTRICT ENGINEERING OFFICE, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREOF, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**Explanatory Note**

Among the many functions of the government is to provide and manage quality infrastructure facilities and services responsive to the needs of the people. Infrastructure is crucially important to foster the region's economic development and prosperity. With this, it is necessary that government offices are readily accessible in areas that need them most.

This Act seeks to establish a Sub-District Engineering Office (SDEO) for the Special Geographic Area (SGA), covering sixty-three (63) barangays. Currently, there is no specific DEO for the SGA. The 63 barangays are scattered and located in the following:

a. From *Pikit Municipality* (22 barangays) – Macabual, Gligli, Rajah Muda, Bagoingud, Bulol, Kabalasan, Buliok, Barungis, Bualan, Lagunde, Panicupan, Batulawan, Fort Pikit, Pamalian, Manaulanan, Balong, Balungis, Nabundas, Gokoton, Nalapaan, Macasendeg, Nunguan;
b. From *Pigcawayan Municipality* (12 barangays) – Lower Baguer, Balacayon, Buricain, Datu Binasing, Datu Mantil, Kadingilan, Libungan Torreta, Matilac, Lower Pangangkalan, Upper Pangangkalan, Patot, Simsiman;
c. From *Carmen Municipality* (7 barangays) – Kitulaan, Pebpoloan, Manarapan, Langogan, Tupig, Kib-Ayao, Nasapian;
d. From *Kabacan Municipality* (7 barangays) – Tamped, Simbuhay, Simone, Nanga-an, Buluan, Pedtad, Sanggadong;
e. From *Midsayap Municipality* (13 barangays) – Central Labas, Malingao, Tumbras, Kapinpilan, Sambulawan, Tugal, Mudseng, Kadingilan, Nabalawag, Kadigasan, Damatulan, Olandang, Kudarangan; and
f. From *Aleosan Municipality* (2 barangays) – Barangays Dunguan and Tapodoc.

Given the spread of the barangays from the different municipalities in Cotabato province, there is a need for a devoted office that will cater to these areas.

With the passage of this Bill, the SGA Sub-DEO will be able to provide quality public infrastructure and maintenance services in its area of jurisdiction. It is expected to bring important benefits to the lives of those residing and those who are doing business in the SGA. Improvements in the quality of infrastructure services will also help cut the cost of doing business and will result to positive economic value that can stimulate job creation, encourage private investments, improve productivity and ensure the well-being of the Bangsamoro people.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
