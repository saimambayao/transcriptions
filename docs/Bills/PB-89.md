**AN ACT PROMOTING CLEAN WATER IN THE BANGSAMORO, INCLUDING SAFE DRINKING WATER, THROUGH EFFECTIVE WATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Water. As ubiquitous as it may seem, especially in an archipelagic country, the Philippines has been marred with a myriad of water issues. Many of the water supplied to our homes contain toxins like mercury and feces and are therefore unfit for domestic uses, let alone human consumption. But our country's problem with water extends beyond declining water quality. It includes issues on water access and is compounded by increasing water scarcity. As *Greenpeace* noted, our country ranks second lowest among Southeast Asian countries in terms of freshwater availability despite the abundance of freshwater resources.

In the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), water remains a top concern despite the pouring of investments and development assistance in recent years. Decades of armed conflict and government neglect have made access to clean water in the region a luxury. In Sulu and Tawi-Tawi, for instance, the lack of potable water has been ongoing for generations. Hence, projects like the recently funded desalination machines to convert marine water to freshwater initiated by the Bangsamoro Government already go a long way. However, even for areas with an abundance of freshwater, other issues continue to threaten the sustainability of the region’s water sources. For instance, take Lake Lanao, one of, if not the most significant freshwater resource in the region. The image of residents enjoying and utilizing its pristine waters are long gone—only retained in stories of previous generations of people of the Lake.

In a 2021 survey conducted by the Ministry of Science and Technology in BARMM, seventy percent (70%) of the respondents said that the top issue in the region is the quality of water supply—illustrating the importance of this issue to the Bangsamoro. Lack of or inadequate supply of water and declining water quality in the region have health, livelihood, development, ecological and other impacts.

The establishment of BARMM presents an opportunity to correct the decades of inaction of the government to address this perennial problem. Nevertheless, BARMM is also pressed to accelerate economic development in the region. And, we are not oblivious to the inherent tensions that exist between the economic development agenda and the interest to protect the environment, including our water resources. Thus, it is imperative that we, as members of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, institutionalize mechanisms to ensure that our water resources are not only preserved but are restored even as we pursue economic development for our region. Water quality standards consistent with prevailing science and international standards must be set in the region. Moreover, there must be means to ensure strict compliance to and enforcement of guidelines on water quality management. These, among others, are just some of the policies needed that would serve as foundations for an effective water quality management system in the region.

Our duty as stewards, our responsibility to preserve and restore our water resources and guarantee access to clean water for the present and future generations of Bangsamoro, are of invaluable importance. Most especially to a region whose Peoples have not only practical uses, but also hold cultural, religious, and symbolic meanings to water resources.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.

Expenses incurred in said operations shall be reimbursed by the persons found to have caused such pollution upon proper administrative determination in accordance with this Act. Reimbursements of the cost incurred shall be made to the Water Quality Management Fund or to such other funds where said disbursements were sourced.

**Section 15. Programmatic Environmental Impact Assessment.** – The Board shall implement programmatic compliance with the environmental impact assessment system.

Programmatic compliance with the environmental impact assessment system shall be guided by carrying capacity assessments determined from ecological profiles. Ecological profiles shall Identify environmental constraints and opportunities in programmatic areas. Programmatic assessment shall also consider cumulative impacts and risks.

Consistent with the provisions of the Local Government Code, the Board may enter into agreement with LGUs to incorporate programmatic environmental impact assessment into the preparation, updating or revision of local land use plans and area development plans.
