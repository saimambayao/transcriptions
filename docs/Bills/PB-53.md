**AN ACT**
**CREATING THE BANGSAMORO MEDICAL SCHOOL IN COTABATO CITY, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.**

**Explanatory Note**

"Wherever the art of Medicine is loved, there is also a love of Humanity."

— Hippocrates

Under Sec. 16 of Article IX, of Republic Act No. 11054, *it shall be a top priority of the Bangsamoro Government to establish, maintain, and support a complete and integrated system of quality education, which shall be a subsystem of the national education system. The Bangsamoro Government shall develop an educational framework relevant and responsive to the needs, ideals, and aspirations of the Bangsamoro people.*

This Parliament body have approved several bills establishing numerous hospitals in the region, adopted health standards and upgraded facilities of existing hospitals in observance of the policy on health of the Bangsamoro government. In relation to that, this representation created this bill to further implement the aforementioned policy by creating a medical school to encourage and open the opportunity to the Bangsamoro people to study medicine.

The Mindanao State University – College of Medicine is the only government medical school in Mindanao and the only medical school in the region, started in the school year 1984-1985. The college aims to provide competent medical practitioners for the underserved medically-depressed areas of the MINSUPALA (Mindanao, Sulu, and Palawan) region as well as to provide opportunities for Muslim students and other members of the cultural communities including poor but deserving students of MINSUPALA region to become Doctors of Medicine and serve the areas from which they come.

Considering that we are under the pandemic, aspiring medical students of different areas in the region, maybe contemplating as to the risks and the costs to pursue such education in faraway cities. That is why, this bill seeks to aid the desire of the Bangsamoro to medical education.

Furthermore, in our journey to a meaningful self – governance, an established medical school signifies the capacity of the Bangsamoro Government to address the needs of its people to education and to produce medical practitioners which will be of great help and importance not only to the society as a whole but most especially in our own region.

This representation is of the opinion that it is high time for this Bangsamoro government to establish medical school to cater aspiring medical students and to produce more medical practitioners to mobilize the implementation of the policy on health of the Bangsamoro government.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this legislative measure is earnestly sought.
