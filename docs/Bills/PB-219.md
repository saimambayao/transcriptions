**AN ACT ESTABLISHING A REGIONWIDE GEO-TAGGING SYSTEM FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

This bill aims to make it a legacy of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority under the leadership of Chief Minister Ahod "Al Haj Murad" Ebrahim and Parliament Speaker Ali Pangalian Balindong to institutionalize Moral Governance through legislation of a geo-tagging system for all infrastructure projects.

During his January 21, 2021, speech, Chief Minister Ahod Ebrahim stated in his report:

"The level of transparency in our infrastructure work has been manifested with the Expanded Bangsamoro Advanced Road Mapping and Management (E-BARMM) System - an online repository of the Ministry of Public Works - BARMM projects. Using geotagged photos for data validation, the core goals of the E-BARMM System are transparency and efficiency in project monitoring."

While geo-tagging is currently in place for the Ministry of Public Works, the system may in the future no longer be continued. Thus, the best practice may, in the future, be lost. In order to safeguard the best practice as being done by the present BARMM, its institutionalization through law is sought. Moreover, this will institutionalize geo-tagging not only in the MPW but in all the various agencies and instrumentalities of Bangsamoro that are implementing infrastructure projects. This will allow for a development reference that includes all sectors and improve the planning and programming for an integrated long-term anti-poverty and improved access to social services program.

Under the second Bangsamoro Transition Authority, the priority of the Government of the Day is to instill and maintain transparency, accountability, and efficiency in the delivery of government services which can be achieved through the use of information technology and institutionalizing systems which will be a legacy of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority to the next regular parliaments.

The geo-tagging of all infrastructure projects in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region will allow for more effective policymaking by the regional government agencies as well as National and local government units, improve the planning and programming of development projects, determine the location of geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas (GIDA) based on the cumulative location of development projects, and track and monitor the progress of government 59 projects.

The Updated Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022 acknowledges geo-tagging as a means for transparency and better planning and programming. President Duterte's "Build Build Build" programs have specific implementation reforms, which include the mandatory geo-tagging of projects.

Geo-tagging is an efficient way of tracking the existence and progress of government projects, as it allows government officials and the citizenry alike to check and follow up on projects as they are being carried out in real time.

With the use of a GPS-enabled phone, anyone can easily learn to take geo-tagged photos and upload them to the web-based platforms of various government agencies.

Geo-tagging is a revolutionary and inexpensive approach to using Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Global Positioning System (GPS) applications for accurate visualization of projects.

One of the benefits of geo-tagging is that it is very cost-effective and safe as it allows for easier monitoring of progress on the ground and in communities without having to undergo the security risks as well as the logistics costs. This will also provide easy reference for development partners and implementing agencies as to the location of current development works in order to better plan for other development interventions. This also serves as a transparency mechanism that allows the citizens to monitor development in their communities, avoid duplication and overlapping of infrastructure projects, and eliminate fictitious projects as well as false reporting of data. This will also allow the government agencies to determine which areas are receiving development projects and which areas are lagging in terms of infrastructure development.

Moreover, this will become a regional integrated spatial development database that will be vital for regional development planning.

As early as 2013, the National Economic Development Authority hailed and awarded the Mindanao Rural Development Authority with the 'Good Practice Award' for applying geo-tagging technology for good governance and transparency.

In 2020, National DPWH has required mandatory geo-tagging of all infrastructure projects, regardless of cost, infrastructure type, or fund source, in the four stages of the project: before project implementation, upon mobilization, during the monthly progress, and upon completion. This is to improve efficiency in planning, budgeting, project monitoring, and contract management processes.

In the National Government, geo-tagging technology has already been institutionalized in several executive agencies. Geo-tagging is already institutionalized in the Department of Public Works and Highways, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. The National agencies have used geo-tagging to build up their database and strengthen development planning and implementation.

In April 2019, RA 11315 was signed by former President Rodrigo Duterte, which established a community-based monitoring system (CBMS). It is "an organized technology-based system of collecting, processing, and validating necessary disaggregated data for monitoring at the local level while empowering communities to participate in the process." The CBMS utilizes geo-tagging technology together with other data collection methodologies of the National Government and local governments. The lead agency is the Philippine Statistics Authority.

Likewise, President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. assured that transparency and accountability would be the cornerstones of governance and policies, especially as his administration ramps up significant projects, including digitalization and infrastructure.

The current administration has prioritized Moral Governance, which includes transparency. This bill will provide our citizenry the transparency they seek and ensure their taxes are being used for the improvement of the welfare of Bangsamoro.

The adoption of this policy on transparency will redound in increased public trust in the Government of the Day and institutionalize a legacy of Moral Governance, transparency, efficiency, and effectiveness for the Bangsamoro Government.

This legacy bill will pave the way for the institutionalization of the right project for the right location at the right time for the right people and will promote people's empowerment and reduce poverty.

In line with this, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
