**AN ACT**
**ESTABLISHING A PERMANENT BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT CENTER OF BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM) PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**Explanatory Note**

Section 1, Article VII of the Bangsamoro Organic Law provides that “The Parliament shall fix by law the permanent seat of the Bangsamoro Government anywhere within the territorial jurisdiction of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region taking into consideration accessibility and efficiency in which its mandate may be carried out under this Organic Law.”

Further, Section 9, Chapter 2, Book I of the Bangsamoro Administrative Code also provides that “The seat of the Bangsamoro Government shall be in Cotabato City, unless otherwise provided by the Bangsamoro Parliament in a subsequent law.”

The current Bangsamoro Government Center is located at the Office of the Regional Governor (ORG) compound where the seat of the defunct Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) was situated for many long years. The structures of this Bangsamoro Government Center have been the witness of the previous generations of governors, assemblymen, and other public officials. Obviously, the organizational structure of the defunct ARMM was not as huge as the mandate provided by the Bangsamoro Organic Law to the reigning Bangsamoro Government of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. The compound is then sufficient to accommodate the not so huge number of officials and employees of the ARMM government working at the Bangsamoro Government Center. In contrast, at present the current Bangsamoro Government Center is insufficient to accommodate all the eighty (80) Members of the Parliament, Office of the Chief Minister, various BARMM Ministries, all BARMM Offices and its attached agencies. Consequently, some Office of Members of the Parliament, BARMM Ministries, and other BARMM agencies are situated outside the ORG compound.

Since the commencement of the Bangsamoro Organic Law and its political engagement in May 2019 the traffic congestions particularly at Governor Gutierrez Street heading to the ORG compound could not compliment with the traffic policies such as number coding scheme and other strategies of the traffic enforcers. The effort is not enough to manage the daily traffic along Governor Gutierrez Street considering that within the vicinity several schools, malls, barter trade, and other business centers are situated. Obviously, due to traffic congestion, sending and distributing pertinent documents, communications, and information to various BARMM Offices, Ministries, and Agencies outside the current BGC compound is time consuming that most of the time prejudices the performance and result of other needed mandates.

This Proposed Bill contemplates an establishment of a permanent Bangsamoro Government Center in another place within Cotabato City. This measure mandates the Bangsamoro Government to purchase a vast of land where a much wider Parliament Session Hall is to be established, legislative office of the eighty (80) Members of the Parliament, Office of the Chief Minister, BARMM Ministries, and BARMM Offices and its attached agencies will be accommodated in a one strategic area. It contemplates further for a sufficient parking space for the vehicles of eighty (80) Members of the Parliament, BARMM employees, visitors, guests, diplomats, and other dignitaries so as not to cause obstruction and turmoil on the parking site within the proposed Bangsamoro Government Center and prevent tardiness due to traffic congestions to many employees.

This proposed measure also brings an opportunity for economic growth in the area where the permanent Bangsamoro Government Center may be situated. Aside from a more convenient workplace, a business center such as but not limited to food hubs, convenience stores, and amenities may be embraced therein. Beyond easing the congestion within the Governor Gutierrez Street, the permanent Bangsamoro Government Center is expected to spread development to other parts of Cotabato City, generate jobs for other constituents and help the economy achieve sustainable growth.

Also, this proposed measure mandates for the creation of a special committee, a Technical Working Group (TWG), a group responsible to provide necessary information and data such as but not limited to the identification of the location, cost of the construction, and other pertinent statistics in the furtherance of the study and success of this proposal.

It is my fervent hope that by enacting this Proposed Bill the opportunities to have a well-planned Bangsamoro Government Center with modern facilities and technology to enhance government efficiency and productivity will be boundless.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this measure is earnestly sought.
