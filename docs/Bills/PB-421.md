**Explanatory Note**

The recent global health crises – most notably the COVID-19 pandemic – have underscored the urgent need for proactive, coordinated, and culturally responsive public health systems in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).

These events revealed critical gaps in the region's capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to emerging infectious diseases (EID), particularly at points of entry such as airports, seaports, and land borders.

The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) currently functions without a statutory quarantine agency empowered to manage infectious disease surveillance. The absence of this quarantine agency impedes timely responses to emerging health threats and undermines compliance with International Health Regulations under World Health Organization’s frameworks.

Section 2 (rr), Article V of the RA 11054 provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise its authority over quarantine regulations.

Without a specialized and empowered regional agency dedicated to quarantine and control diseases, the region remains vulnerable to outbreaks that can rapidly overwhelm local health systems, disrupt economic activity, and endanger lives. The impact of such events transcends health—it touches upon the security, dignity, and collective well-being of the Bangsamoro people.

In response to this urgent need, this bill seeks to establish the Bangsamoro Bureau of Quarantine, an agency attached to the Ministry of Health (MOH). It shall be mandated to lead the region's quarantine operations, disease surveillance, health screening at ports of entry and exit, contact tracing, outbreak response, and public health emergency preparedness. The Bureau shall operate in alignment with the International Health Regulations (IHR) of the World Health Organization (WHO) and in close coordination with the national Bureau of Quarantine and other relevant agencies.

The Bureau's creation is not merely an administrative measure; it is an instrument of public health justice. By institutionalizing disease control and quarantine functions within BARMM, the region affirms its commitment to safeguard public health. The Bureau shall ensure that all quarantine protocols, surveillance mechanisms, and public health interventions are scientific-based, culturally sensitive, and religiously appropriate, thereby upholding the dignity, rights, and welfare of all Bangsamoro citizens.

From an Islamic perspective, the practice of quarantine is not foreign; it is rooted in the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), who said:

"If you hear that a plague is in a land, do not go to it; and if it occurs in a land while you are in it, do not leave it." (Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith 5728)

This hadith is recognized by scholars as a foundational basis for modern quarantine and containment measures. Islam promotes not only faith, but also sound action in the face of danger—values that this bill seeks to integrate into the public health governance of BARMM.

The Bangsamoro Government holds a moral and constitutional duty to ensure that disease outbreaks and public health emergencies do not undermine the region's development, security, and unity. Through this legislative measure, we take a vital step toward institutionalizing a resilient, responsive, and ethically guided quarantine system that is built on both science and timeless Islamic principle.

Establishing the Bangsamoro Bureau of Quarantine is no longer optional—it's fundamental for safeguarding public health, and ensuring BARMM's readiness for future pandemics.

In view of the foregoing, the immediate passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
