**AN ACT ESTABLISHING A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROMOTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF TOURISM IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO, PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES¹**

**Explanatory Note**

Section 2, Article IV of Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), states that in the exercise of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region’s right to self-governance, it is free to pursue its political, economic, social and cultural development.

Section 2 (yy), Article V of the BOL, provides that subject to Section 20, Article X of the 1987 Constitution, the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise its authority over **tourism development** without prejudice to the general supervision of the President of the Republic of the Philippines.

Moreover, Section 35, Article XIII of the BOL states that the Bangsamoro Government shall promote tourism within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. It may recommend the designation of tourism enterprise zones to the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority, in accordance with Republic Act No. 9593, otherwise known as " *The Tourism Act of 2009.*"

The Secretary of the Department of Tourism, Christina Garcia Franco, formally unveiled the completed National Tourism Development Plan (NTDP) for 2023 to 2028 at the Tourism Stakeholders’ National Summit organized by the Department of Tourism (DOT) on March 15, 2023. The NTDP serves as a blueprint for the strategies on how the Department of Tourism intends to continue and to grow the impact of tourism upon the Philippine economy in the next few years. This will be the guidebook of the industry, where the department shall put in place mechanisms for sustainability for the years to come².

In addition, she also reported that 2022 was a fruitful year for the Philippine tourism industry, underscoring that last year’s international arrivals reached 2.65 million, exceeding the initial target of 1.7 million foreign visitors. This figure, she noted, translated to Php 214 billion, or roughly US$ 4 billion in estimated revenues. These statistics show a boost for the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the post-pandemic era, exceeding the targeted revenue of Php155.03 billion by 38.06 percent.³

During the first-ever Bangsamoro Business Congress last January 2023, the Ministry of Trade, Investments, and Tourism (MTIT) – Bureau of Tourism Director Marites Maguindra stressed that the BARMM has countless tourism destinations, comparable to the popular tourist destinations in the country. She further stated that there are around 784,495 tourist arrivals since 2019 in the region.⁴

The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is a relatively new political entity created on 2019 by virtue of Republic Act No. 11054, commonly known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL). The Bangsamoro Transition Authority, as the interim government of the region during the transition period, has the obligation and duty to develop and promote the tourism of the region. Therefore, it is imperative for the Bangsamoro government to develop interventions that will serve as the catalyst for the long-term and sustainable growth of the region.

The creation of a comprehensive framework for the development of tourism in the Bangsamoro region, as proposed in this measure, seeks to develop tourism in the region as one of its major socio-economic priorities. It is a framework that promotes a balance between the growth of the region economically, and the protection of the environment.

The promotion of tourism can be of service to the Bangsamoro people, not just in preserving the culture heritage of our people and developing the region, but also, creating livelihood opportunities that can improve the lives of the local communities in the region. In addition, this framework can make the local communities one of the primary beneficiaries of the profits to be generated from the development of tourism in the region. By encouraging the local communities to participate in developing tourism in the region, these measures can foster peace, unity, and understanding among the Bangsamoro people.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
