Introduced by: **MP FROILYN T. MENDOZA**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

This bill seeks to recognize, respect, and protect the rights of Indigenous Peoples to preserve and develop their cultures, traditions, and institutions, particularly the Non-Moro Indigenous Peoples (NMIPs) of the Tëduray, Lambangian, Dulangan Manobo/Mënubu Dulangan, Blaan, and Higaonon, and other Indigenous Peoples that ascribe as NMIPs in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.

This is anchored on our national policy to recognize and promote the rights of Indigenous Peoples within the framework of national unity and development. Likewise, the proposal empowers our constitutional duty to protect the rights of Indigenous Peoples to their ancestral lands, cultures, traditions, and institutions to ensure their economic, social, and cultural well-being.

As stated in the Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the “Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao”, the Bangsamoro Government recognizes the rights of the Non-Moro Indigenous Peoples and shall adopt measures for the promotion and protection of the following rights: (a) Native titles or fusaka ingëd; (b) Indigenous customs and traditions; (c) Justice systems and indigenous political structures; (d) Equitable share in revenues from the utilization of resources in their ancestral lands; (e) Free, prior, and informed consent; (f) Political participation in the Bangsamoro Government including reserved seats for the Non-Moro Indigenous Peoples in the Parliament; (g) Basic political and social services; and (h) Freedom of choice as to their identity.

Our Bangsamoro Organic Law further mandates the creation of a Ministry for Non-Moro Indigenous Peoples with the primary responsibility of formulating and implementing policies, plans, and programs to promote the well-being of all Non-Moro Indigenous Peoples in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, in recognition of their ancestral domain as well as their rights thereto.

This measure attempts to be faithful to the aforesaid directives of the Constitution and of our Bangsamoro Organic Law. This bill also aims to ensure that our Parliament shall in no way diminish the rights and privileges granted to Non-Moro Indigenous Peoples by virtue of the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, and other laws pertaining to Non-Moro Indigenous Peoples in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

This bill will play a crucial role in the development of Non-Moro Indigenous Peoples. It is thus imperative for the Parliament to give its full and unwavering support to them.

In view of the foregoing, the immediate passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
