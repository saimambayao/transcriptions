**AN ACT STRENGTHENING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REPUBLIC ACT NO. 11330 WHICH CONVERTED THE DINAIG MUNICIPAL HOSPITAL INTO A 50-BED CAPACITY HOSPITAL KNOWN AS THE DATU ODIN SINSUAT DISTRICT HOSPITAL IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF DATU ODIN SINSUAT, MAGUINDANAO DEL NORTE, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Datu Odin Sinsuat District Hospital was established in 1990 as the Dinaig Municipal Hospital which had a capacity of 10 beds in the municipality of Datu Odin Sinsuat, Maguindanao del Norte. In 2019, Republic Act No. 11330 converted the Dinaig Municipal Hospital into a 50-bed district hospital known as the Datu Odin Sinsuat District Hospital.

Under Republic Act No. 11330, the provincial government of Maguindanao shall continue to provide funding for the hospital while the Department of Health shall support the capital outlay requirements of the said district hospital. However, the new district hospital has never fully received the budgetary support it needed to fully implement the upgrade provided under its charter.

After consultation with the management of the district hospital, it was reported that while the hospital was converted into a 50-bed capacity district hospital, it remained operating at a 10-bed capacity, serving a catchment population as large as two hundred thousand.

The lack of sufficient funding for the district hospital has apparent and serious consequences. The overburdened limited health care facilities of the district hospital and the staff shortage negatively impact the hospital's overall efficiency.

This bill seeks to provide support to the Datu Odin Sinsuat District Hospital which shall include appropriation in an amount commensurate with its status as a 50-bed district hospital, consistent with the policy of the Bangsamoro government to protect and promote the health and well-being of its constituents.

In view of the foregoing, this representation humbly for the early passage of this legislation.
