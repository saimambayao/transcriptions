**AN ACT**
**ESTABLISHING A COLLEGE EDUCATION BRIDGING FUND TO SUPPORT QUALIFIED STUDENTS FROM LOW-INCOME FAMILIES IN THE BANGSAMORO REGION, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Access to quality and affordable higher education remains a challenge for many students from low-income families in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). While existing scholarship programs provide support to deserving students, many still fall through the cracks due to limited coverage, strict eligibility requirements, or economic hardship that prevents them from sustaining their education.

This bill is anchored on key provisions of Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law, specifically:

a) Article IX, Section 2 mandates the Bangsamoro Government to "establish, maintain, and support a complete and integrated system of quality education" that is "relevant and responsive to the needs, ideals, and aspirations of the Bangsamoro people."

b) Section 4 of the same Article grants the Bangsamoro Government the authority to establish and support education systems responsive to the region's specific needs.

c) Section 6 provides that the Bangsamoro Government "shall provide for a program of scholarships and other affirmative actions to uplift the marginalized and disadvantaged sectors, particularly the poor."

d) Furthermore, Article XII, Section 7 emphasizes that the Bangsamoro Government shall give priority to education in the allocation and use of its funds, thereby supporting the appropriation proposed in this measure.

Through this bill, we aim to uphold the constitutional mandate of making education accessible to all and fulfill our moral and legal duty to ensure that no Bangsamoro student is left behind due to poverty. The passage of this bill will contribute to building a more equitable and educated Bangsamoro society.

According to the 2023 Labor Force Survey released by the Philippine Statistics Authority, BARMM has the lowest tertiary education attainment rate in the country, with only 9.6% of the population aged 25 years and older having completed a college degree—far below the national average of 24.9%. The same report also notes that BARMM continues to register one of the highest poverty incidences in the Philippines, with over 50% of the population living below the poverty threshold as of 2021. These figures underscore the direct correlation between poverty and limited access to higher education.

While tuition in public colleges and universities is covered under the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act (RA 10931), many Bangsamoro students still struggle with incidental expenses such as transportation, dormitory accommodations, food, learning materials, and internet connectivity—factors that often lead to dropout or delayed graduation.

This proposed measure seeks to establish a College Education Bridging Fund (CEBF) to provide financial assistance to qualified students from low-income families in the Bangsamoro region. The fund is envisioned as a supplemental support mechanism for students who have already completed at least their third year in college but are at risk of dropping out due to financial constraints. It aims to help them complete their degrees and unlock greater opportunities for productive employment, empowerment, and participation in the regional development.

The Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education (MBHTE-BARMM), which currently implements regional scholarship and student assistance programs, shall be authorized to administer the Fund in coordination with relevant stakeholders. Its Higher Education Department may allocate a portion of its annual budget—or receive additional appropriations through this Act—to implement the CEBF. Furthermore, the Ministry may explore partnerships with local government units (LGUs), private institutions, development agencies, and other organizations to strengthen and sustain the Fund.

The CEBF aims to:

a) Bridge financial gaps that prevent deserving students from accessing or completing their college education;

b) Improve student retention and graduation rates, especially in geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas;

c) Support peacebuilding and regional development by empowering the next generation through education;

d) Contribute to the Bangsamoro Government's vision of building a more educated, skilled, and competitive workforce.

The establishment of this Fund is consistent with the Bangsamoro Education Code of 2021, the Bangsamoro Development Plan 2023–2028, and the 12-Point Priority Agenda of the Bangsamoro Government—all of which underscore the importance of inclusive, accessible, and equitable education for all.

In view of the foregoing, the immediate passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
