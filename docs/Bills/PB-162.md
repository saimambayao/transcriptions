**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Since the inception of revolutionary movements in the Philippines some 50 years ago, Sulu province had been in constant challenge of peace and order as it had been particularly prone to conflicts. Such a fact has deprived the residents of Sulu of various opportunities and support from the government and has stalled economic progress and development in the province. As a result, the delivery of basic services to the Sulu people had not been on par vis-à-vis other provinces in the country, in particular, on the aspect of health services in the province.

The people of Sulu usually go to hospitals and seek medical treatment when they are already in severe conditions that doctors can no longer cure and provide treatment. There are several reasons for the occurrence of such incidence such as the financial difficulty of the residents, since according to current data, out of all 82 provinces in the Philippines, Sulu is the poorest, as evidenced by its having the highest poverty rate. Likewise, while there may be existing hospitals and health clinics, the lack of adequate health services, medical facilities, and equipment that are provided by the existing hospitals contributes to the difficulty in the treatments of the patients. To some, going to other places where there are more sophisticated health services and facilities requires some fortune.

Parang district hospital is a government-run hospital and is currently a level 1 hospital with an authorized bed capacity of only 10. It is located in the municipality of Parang Sulu, which is far from the main town of the province, Jolo municipality where the provincial hospital is situated.

With each passing day, the population of the municipality and its neighboring areas is increasing. This goes to say that more and more people will require medical services from the only available nearby hospital, which is the parang district hospital. This situation has prompted the hospital to render medical services beyond its projected capacity precisely since it has a limited number of bed capacity as a level 1 hospital.

Hence, to ensure that the residents of Parang Municipality and its neighboring communities are accommodated and provided with immediate, adequate and more effective access to health care services since the municipality is far from the main town of Jolo, Sulu, it is believed that there is a need to upgrade the current level of Parang District Hospital from Level 1 into Level II hospital thereby increasing its bed capacity.

In view of the pertinent provisions of RA 11054 otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law, Section 22 provides that "The Bangsamoro government shall adopt a policy on health that provides for a comprehensive and integrated health service delivery for its constituents. It shall establish by law a general hospital system to serve the requirements of its people to ensure that the individual basic right to life shall be attainable through the prompt intervention of excellent and affordable medical services.", this government should take as paramount consideration the need to enact a bill that will address the impending health services problems of the constituent municipalities of Parang and other neighboring areas.
