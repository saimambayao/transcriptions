**AN ACT**
**PROMOTING THE DIGITALIZATION OF ALL FRONTLINE SERVICES IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS GOVERNMENT, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

It is the policy of the Bangsamoro Government to prioritize the acquisition, adoption, innovation, and application of science and technology for development. Thus, it shall exercise the powers granted to it to promote the general welfare of the Bangsamoro people.

During the inauguration of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, Jr. renewed his commitment to the peace process in Muslim Mindanao, as well as the push for socioeconomic development, and interventions to promote peace and development in areas across the region.

With the allocation of P74.4 billion for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region for 2023, President Marcos, Jr. encouraged the Parliament to pass measures that will secure the welfare of the Bangsamoro, particularly the development of digital infrastructure and e-governance.

As part of our shared vision for the BARMM through the lens of moral governance, it is high time that we subscribe and implement digital transformation in the regional government through the use of electronic services and platforms.

In response to the call of the Central Government, this measure seeks to increase the productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness in the delivery of regional government frontline services through the automation of all frontline government services within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Government.

In the bill, the author proposes to mandate the BICTO in instituting a ten-year roadmap to digitalization which will ultimately provide, among others, the following mechanisms:

a. Remove redundant and unduly burdensome processes, procedures, and requirements;
b. Adopt processes that are the least costly to the transacting public; and
c. Observe the whole-of-government approach which promotes data sharing, simultaneous assessment of applications and/or requests, one-time assessment and payment of taxes, fees and charges; and
d. Maximize the use of technology as the best way to implement a zero-contact policy

Through the full digital transformation of all regional frontline services, including the adoption of an integrated, interconnected, and interoperable information, resource sharing, and communications network in the region, we can significantly increase productivity and inclusiveness of service production, and provide a more transparent public service.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
