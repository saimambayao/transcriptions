**AN ACT ESTABLISHING IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF NORTHERN KABUNTALAN, PROVINCE OF MAGUINDANAO DEL NORTE, A LEVEL I GENERAL HOSPITAL TO BE KNOWN AS THE NORTHERN KABUNTALAN MUNICIPAL HOSPITAL, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Northern Kabuntalan is a fifth-class municipality of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), composed of around 26,000 residents. Currently, its constituents rely on Rural Health Unit (RHU) for medical attention. However, the RHU's capacity is limited to checkups, basic treatment, and pregnancy deliveries.

Owing to the absence of a local hospital, cases beyond the RHU's capabilities are transferred to hospitals outside Northern Kabuntalan. These cases include cancer patients requiring management, dengue patients for further treatment, and first-time or delicate pregnancy deliveries. The same goes for patients who require monitoring, observation, and laboratory testing. They are referred or transferred to Midsayap, Libungan or Dalikan. There are others who go to Cotabato City.

While the municipality provides ambulance transfers for select instances, most residents just travel by habal-habal. On the other hand, those living on the riverside of Northern Kabuntalan still need to take a boat ride before moving by land. Undeniably, the lack of a local hospital adds logistical and financial burdens for the patients, especially the lesser fortunate. It likewise delays treatment in emergencies. This situation presents an immediate need to provide an accessible hospital service to the residents.

In line with Sec. 22 Art. 9 of the Bangsamoro Organic Law, which mandates the Bangsamoro Government to establish a general hospital system to serve the health requirements of its people, this bill proposes to build a level 1 general hospital in Northern Kabuntalan. Having a hospital in the said municipality will improve the accessibility of treatment to the patients. Further, the availability of diagnostic and observatory facilities will also help mitigate illnesses and improve the overall wellness of the people. It may also cater to the constituents of the municipalities of Mother Kabuntalan and Datu Piang.

The aim of this bill aligns with the Bangsamoro Government's duty of ensuring the basic right to life through the prompt intervention of excellent and affordable medical services. It is also in consonance with the Constitutional mandate of the State to protect and promote the people's right to health, and to make health services available to all people at affordable cost.

The passage of this bill is a fulfillment of our duty to the Bangsamoro people. In view thereof, its approval is earnestly sought.
