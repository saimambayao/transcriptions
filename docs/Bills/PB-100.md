Republic of the Philippines
Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao
**BANGSAMORO TRANSITION AUTHORITY**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Sibutu is a municipality in the province of Tawi-Tawi with a land area of 109 square kilometers and a population of approximately 34,243 who are mostly boat builders and seaweed farmers. It lies about 14 k.m. east of the coast of Sabah, Malaysia. The municipality was created out of Sitangkai, Tawi-Tawi, by virtue of Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act No. 197, which was subsequently ratified in a plebiscite held on October 21, 2006. It has a poverty incidence of 26.26% per Philippine Statistics Authority. The only hospital in the municipality is Datu Alawaddin T. Bandon, Sr. Municipal Hospital which is a level I hospital with ten (10) bed capacity. The management of the hospital reported that the average bed occupancy rate was 95.89% in 2019; 85.44% in 2020; and 73% in 2021; and the existing facilities are gravely not up to standards and needs of its people. The next closest medical facility is the Datu Sakilan Memorial Hospital in the Municipality of Bongao which is around 51.7 kilometers. Their only mode of transportation to Bongao is by motor launch scheduled three times a week. In case of serious medical emergency, our constituents in that remote area not only have to wait for a scheduled trip to Bongao, but would also have to endure the distress and perils of traveling by sea for 3 hours. Since Datu Halun Sakilan Memorial Hospital is also a level I hospital with bed occupancy rate of 150 to 200 percent, in most cases, they would have to travel to Zamboanga City for proper medical attention. This has caused tremendous hardships and numerous fatalities for the people of those islands.

Section 8, Article IX of the Bangsamoro Organic Law states that “the Bangsamoro Government shall provide, maintain, and ensure the delivery of basic and responsive health programs... to the Bangsamoro people and other inhabitants of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.” Section 22, Article IX of the same law further enunciates that “the Bangsamoro Government shall adopt a policy on health that provides for a comprehensive and integrated health service delivery for its constituents. It shall establish by law a general hospital system to serve the health requirements of its people and ensure that the individual's basic right to life shall be attainable through the prompt intervention of excellent and affordable medical services.”

Therefore, it is incumbent upon the Bangsamoro Government as part of its core mandate to afford the people of Sibutu quality medical facilities and services by upgrading the only hospital in that municipality from level i of ten (10) bed capacity to level ii of (50) bed capacity.
