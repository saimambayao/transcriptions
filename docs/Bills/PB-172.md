**MANDATING THE FORMULATION AND PUBLICATION OF A KATARUNGANG PAMBARANGAY HANDBOOK THAT WILL BE TRANSLATED INTO THE BARMM MAJOR DIALECTS**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Section 6, Article IV of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) provides that:

> *"Promotion of Unity. – The Bangsamoro Government shall promote unity, peace, justice, and goodwill among all peoples, as well as encourage a just and peaceful settlement of disputes."*

Katarungang Pambarangay or Barangay Justice System is a community-based mechanism for dispute settlement administered by the basic political unit of the country - the Barangay whose ultimate goal is to improve access to justice through amicable settlement of family and community disputes.

Barangays are at the very frontline of the provision of basic services and have become a strategic point to ensure that government programs are felt by the people, they being the first responders of governance and are within the reach of mostly all constituents.

Based on the findings of the National Capital Region Report, almost 20% of the participants of a study conducted in NCR were not aware of any services offered by the Lupon. Hence, it is possible to suggest that in more isolated areas, the lack of information will be higher than in the capital region.

In order to address the communities' lack of knowledge and appreciation of the Barangay Justice System and help the implementors of the Katarungang Pambarangay Law in understanding their mandate, a handbook that will serve as a reference for Barangay officials will be formulated, developed, and translated into the BARMM's major dialects.

For these reasons, this representation earnestly asks for the approval of the bill.
