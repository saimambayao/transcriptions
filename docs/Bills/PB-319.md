**AN ACT ESTABLISHING A COMPREHENSIVE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE REGISTRATION, REGULATION, AND SUPPORT OF CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS (CSOS) OPERATING WITHIN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is an area endowed with rich cultural heritage and diverse communities. The establishment of BARMM has provided a unique opportunity to foster inclusive governance, social development, and human rights protection. Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) play a critical role in these efforts by promoting community participation, advocating for marginalized groups, and contributing to the development and implementation of policies.

CSOs are instrumental in advancing social justice, promoting human rights, and supporting community development. Their grassroots presence and ability to mobilize resources make them essential partners in achieving the goals of BARMM. A legal framework will formally acknowledge their contributions and provide the necessary support to amplify their impact.

While CSOs are crucial to development, it is essential to ensure that they operate with the highest standards of accountability and transparency. The proposed Act will establish mechanisms for the registration and accreditation of CSOs, ensuring that they adhere to good governance practices and are accountable to their stakeholders.

Recognizing the significant contributions of CSOs, it is imperative to provide a comprehensive legal framework that facilitates their registration, regulation, and support. This framework will enhance their capacity to operate effectively and sustainably, ensuring that they can continue to play their vital role in the socio-economic development of BARMM.

A structured framework will facilitate better collaboration between the Bangsamoro Government and CSOs. This collaboration is vital for the effective planning, implementation, and monitoring of development programs and policies. By providing clear guidelines and support mechanisms, the Act will strengthen partnerships and enhance the overall effectiveness of development initiatives in BARMM.

Many CSOs face challenges related to capacity and funding. The proposed Act includes provisions for capacity-building programs and financial support, enabling CSOs to improve their organizational and operational capacities. This support will empower CSOs to undertake more significant initiatives and expand their reach and impact.

The Act will ensure that all CSOs, regardless of their focus area, are treated equitably and that their programs are inclusive and non-discriminatory. This approach will foster a more inclusive and cohesive society, reflecting the diversity and unity of the Bangsamoro people.

In fine, the establishment of a comprehensive legal framework for CSOs in BARMM is a strategic initiative that will enhance the capacity, accountability, and impact of these organizations. By facilitating their registration, regulation, and support, this Act will ensure that CSOs can continue to contribute meaningfully to the development and governance of BARMM. This, in turn, will promote a more inclusive, participatory, and equitable society in the region.

In light of the above, the immediate passage of this Act is earnestly sought.
