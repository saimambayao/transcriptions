**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The first national office including its powers and functions to be devolved to the defunct Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao under the first Organic Act, Republic Act No. 6734, was the Board of Investments, establishing for this purpose the Regional Board of Investments (RBOI) office, as provided by Executive Order (E.O.) No. 458, Series of 1991 of then President Corazon Aquino. This devolution signified the importance put by the national government and autonomous regional government officials in the primary role of the private sector in economic development, creation of employment and productive economic activity that generates taxes for the government. It has been said time and again that taxes are the life blood of government but without the private enterprises and business investments by the private sector there would be no tax revenues that will be generated and nothing to tax.

It is also worth noting that the Omnibus Investment Code was passed into law and was one of the very first laws that then President Corazon Aquino crafted during the Freedom Constitution after the EDSA revolt so that it passed under the executive fiat of Executive Order No. 226, otherwise known as the Omnibus Investment Code of 1987. Together with the first Administrative Code, as promulgated into law by Executive Order No. 292, Series of 1987, under President Corazon Aquino, they have remained as the oldest codes and laws still in the books from that time and hardly changed by later legislation, if at all. In fact, the Omnibus Investment Code even predated the Administrative Code under President Corazon Aquino underlining the importance put by the fledging administration of President Corazon Aquino in bringing in private investments in support of stability and continuity of the Philippine State.

In the case of the autonomous region, the RBOI (now BBOI) has remained as the primary agency in dealing with private sector investments because it is the only agency recognized by national government agencies that is allowed to grant fiscal incentives under the Omnibus Investment Code now amended by Republic Act No. 12066, otherwise known as the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises to Maximize Opportunities for Reinvigorating the Economy (CREATE MORE) Act. These are the following reasons why BBOI continues to be relevant and needs to be maintained by the autonomous region: 1. National Taxes such as Income Taxes and Tariffs and Custom Duties remain within the purview of national government and they are inherently “national” by nature and as such granting of fiscal incentives involving them such as Income Tax Holiday or reduced Custom Duties requires the consent of the national government; 2. While the autonomous region has been granted the power to create its own sources of revenue, national taxes such as income taxes and tariffs and custom duties, have not been devolved to the autonomous regions and it follows that the autonomous region cannot provide for fiscal incentives relating to them except as provided in the terms of devolution of the RBOI; 3. The Bureau of Internal Revenue and the Bureau of Customs have not been devolved to the autonomous region and as such, they only follow national legislation and not regional legislation; and lastly, 4. the BBOI functions and mandate has a direct link to the President because it is the only agency in the autonomous region, which in a regular fashion submits its Regional Investment Priorities Plan together with the national Investment Priorities Plan, now the Strategic Investment Priorities Plan under the CREATE law (RA 11534) for the approval of the President signifying that it is actually the President’s power and prerogative to grant these fiscal incentives involving national taxes and tariffs and custom duties to investors.

By the terms of the devolution of the RBOI under E.O. 458, the governing law for the grant of fiscal incentives to investors involving national taxes and tariffs and custom duties in the autonomous region is the Omnibus Investment Code of 1987 and what was devolved to the autonomous region was the BOI powers and functions in the region. The jurisdiction over fiscal incentives involving national taxes and tariffs and custom duties was not given to the autonomous region except in accordance to the specific grant under E.O. 458. As such, E.O. 458 is very specific that the rules and regulations governing the grant of fiscal incentives must follow the BOI rules and regulations without prejudice to RBOI’s own rules and regulations as long as it is within the ambit of the Omnibus Investment Code. In fact, Section 5 of E.O. 458, as a condition to the devolution of the BOI’s powers and function, withheld the power to approve applications for fiscal incentives in the autonomous region until personnel of the RBOI are trained by the BOI.

Ultimately, the power to grant fiscal incentives to investors involving national taxes and tariffs and custom duties lies with the President and it is considered a power of the President by the clear terms of the Omnibus Investment Code as amended by the CREATE law and now, CREATE MORE law in giving the President the final say in determining the list of industries and economic activities under the Investment Priorities Plan crafted by the BOI and promulgated by the President. The autonomous region is privileged thru the BBOI in being given the power to determine its own Regional Investment Priorities Plan for the grant of fiscal incentives but subject to its incorporation and integration in the annual national Strategic Investment Priorities Plan (SIPP) and subject to final approval and promulgation by the President of the SIPP. No other region in the country enjoys this privilege.

Comes now, Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), which provides under Article XII, Section 8 on Tax Incentives that the BBOI grant of tax exemptions and fiscal incentives under the terms of its devolution in E.O. 458 shall continue to apply. Under the Organic Law of the BARMM, the Bangsamoro Parliament is not precluded to grant fiscal incentives as long as it does not diminish national revenues effectively precluding the grant of fiscal incentives involving national taxes and tariffs and custom duties. The Bangsamoro Parliament in its wisdom may still pass its own Bangsamoro Investment Code with fiscal incentives for investors involving regional taxes and this can be added to the functions of the BBOI. However, with the passage of the CREATE law and amended by CREATE MOE law, the BBOI-BARMM was specifically mentioned as one of the Investment Promotion Agencies (IPAs) covered by the CREATE law and subject to the Oversight of the Fiscal Incentives Review Board (FIRB) co-chaired by the Secretaries of the Department of Finance and the Department of Trade and Industry. Hence, as to the application of national fiscal incentives the BBOI-BARMM has to conform to the CREATE law.

On December 03, 2020, the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 13, otherwise known as the “Bangsamoro Administrative Code” became effective. The BARMM Administrative Code reorganized the RBOI and renamed it as the Bangsamoro Board of Investments (BBOI). The essential change in the BARMM Administrative Code was in the composition of its Board of Governors with ex-officio members coming from the Ministry of Trade, Investment and Tourism, Ministry of Agriculture, Finance and Agrarian Reform and Ministry of Finance, and Budget and Management. The functions and mandate of the Bangsamoro Board of Investments remained the same in accordance with the provisions of the BOL regarding the BBOI.

Last but not least is that the registration of business investors with the BBOI is the primary mechanism wherein corporations and corporate entities become recognized by the Bureau of Internal Revenue as regional tax payers because only investors in the region may register for fiscal incentives with BBOI. After their fiscal incentives from the BBOI expires, the autonomous regional government will partake of its share of the taxes levied on such investors as provided in Article XII, Section 12 on Payment by Corporations, Partnerships or Firms of the Organic Law. The CREATE law, as amended by the CREATE MORE specifically includes the BBOI as among the Investment Promotion Agencies recognized and covered by the law. For these and the foregoing reasons and premises this bill is submitted to the Bangsamoro Parliament for its urgent and priority enactment into law.
