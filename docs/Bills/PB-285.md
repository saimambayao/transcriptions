As enshrined in the Constitution, the State recognizes the vital role of communication and information in nation-building and the indispensable role of private sector in building the same.

Good Communication is critical in all aspects of life and orderly manner of the society and in ensuring coordination and control of circumstances such as emergency situations. Proper coordination saves life. Through proper communication, people receive correct information as it avoids false information, fake news, and non-information.

Radio is among the important source of basic information as this can itself help engender understanding among the people and the enhancement of communities disadvantaged by geography. Granting franchise to Bangsamoro Radio Suwara Meranaw will significantly contribute to the growth of the region in terms of telecommunication, modernization and development.

As such, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.

*Be it enacted by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority in Parliament assembled:*

**Section 1. Declaration of Policy.** – In the exercise of genuine autonomy and self-governance, the Bangsamoro Government is empowered under Article XIII, Section 38 of the “Organic Law of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao” (Republic Act No. 11054), to have the authority to grant regional franchises, licenses, and permits to telecommunication utilities whose frequencies are confined to and whose main offices are located within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region; *Provided, That* nothing herein shall be construed as limiting in any way the power of the Congress of the Philippines to grant national franchises in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

**Section 2. Nature and Scope of Franchise.** - Subject to the provisions of the Constitution and applicable laws, rules and regulations, there is hereby granted **BANGSAMORO RADIO SUWARA MERANAW**, hereunder referred to as the Grantee, its successors or assignees, a Regional franchise to construct, install, establish, operate, and maintain for commercial purposes and in the public interest, throughout the region, wired or wireless telecommunications systems including internet access, through copper, fiber optics, satellite systems, switches, and all other telecommunications systems or information and communications technologies as are at present available or will be made available through technological advances or innovations in the future, and offer telecommunications services, value-added services, including internet access service, or other electronic communication services, such as the transmission and reception of voice, data, facsimile, control signs, audio and video information services, or to construct, acquire, lease and operate or to manage transmitting and receiving stations, lines, cables, or systems, as are convenient or essential to efficiently carry out the purpose of this franchise.

**Section 3. Manner of Operation of Stations or Facilities.** - The stations or facilities of the Grantee shall be constructed and operated in a manner as will, at most, result only in the minimum interference on the wavelengths or frequencies of existing stations or other stations which may be established by law, without in any way diminishing its own privilege to use its assigned wavelengths or frequencies and the quality of transmission or reception thereon should maximize rendition of the Grantee's services and the availability thereof.

**Section 4. Authority of the Bangsamoro Telecommunications Commission (BTC)-BARMM.** - The Grantee shall secure from the NTC-BARMM a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity or the appropriate permits and licenses for the construction, installation, and operation of its telecommunications systems or facilities. In issuing the certificate, the BTC-BARMM shall have the power to regulate and impose such conditions relative to the construction, operation, maintenance, or service level of the telecommunications systems or facilities. Such certificate shall state the areas covered and the date the Grantee shall commence the service. The Grantee shall not use any frequency in the radio spectrum without authorization from the BTC-BARMM. The BTC-BARMM, however, shall not unreasonably withhold or delay the grant of such authority, permit, or license.

MPW or the LGU concerned. Should the Grantee, its successors or assignees, after ten (10)-day notice from the said authority, fail, refuse, or neglect to repair or replace any part of any public place, road, highway, street, lane, alley, avenue, sidewalk, bridge altered, changed or disturbed by the said Grantee, its successors or assignees, then the MPW or the LGU concerned shall have the right to have the same repaired and placed in good order and condition, and charge the Grantee, its successors or assignees, at double the amount of the costs and expenses for such repair or replacement.

**Section 6. Responsibility to the Public.** - The Grantee shall conform to the ethics of honest enterprise and not use its stations or facilities for obscene or indecent transmission, or for dissemination of deliberately false information, or willful misrepresentation, or assist in subversive or treasonable acts.

The Grantee shall improve and extend its services in areas not yet served, and in hazard- and typhoon-prone areas that shall be determined by the BARMM Rapid Emergency Action on Disaster Incidence (READi-BARMM), or its legal successor, in coordination with the BTC-BARMM.

The Grantee shall also improve and upgrade its equipment, facilities and services, in order to ensure effective compliance with the objectives of Republic Act No. 10639 or "The Free Mobile Disaster Alerts Act."

**Section 7. Rates for Services.** - The charges and rates for telecommunications services of the Grantee, except the rates and charges on those that may hereafter be declared or considered as nonregulated services, whether flat rates or measured rates or variations thereof, shall be subject to the approval of the BTC-BARMM or its legal successor. The rates to be charged by the Grantee shall be unbundled, separable, and distinct among the services offered and shall be determined in such a manner that regulated services do not subsidize the unregulated ones.

**Section 8. Right of the Government.** - The radio spectrum is a finite resource that is part of the national patrimony, and the use thereof is a privilege conferred upon the Grantee by the State that may be withdrawn any time after due process.

A special right is hereby reserved to the President of the Philippines, in times of war, rebellion, public peril, calamity, emergency, disaster, or disturbance of peace and order: to temporarily take over and operate the stations, transmitters, facilities or equipment of the Grantee; to temporarily suspend the operation of any station, transmitter, facility, or equipment in the interest of public safety, security, and public welfare; or to authorize the temporary use and operation thereof by any agency of the government, upon due compensation to the Grantee for the use of said stations, transmitters, facilities, or equipment during the period when these shall be so operated.

**Section 9. Term of Franchise.** - This franchise shall be in effect for a period of twenty-five (25) years from the effectivity of this Act, unless sooner revoked or cancelled.
