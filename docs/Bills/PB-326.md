**An Act Providing for Assistance, Benefits and Privileges to Families of Non-Decommissioned Martyred Mujahideen and Mujahidat Providing Funds Therefore and for Other Purposes**

**Explanatory Note**

In the context of contemporary struggles for self-determination and national identity, the sacrifices made by mujahideen and mujahidat—those who have fought and continue to fight for their people's rights—cannot be overlooked. This Act is designed as a critical step toward addressing the profound injustices faced by the families of non-decommissioned martyred mujahideen and mujahidat. Recognizing their sacrifices through the provision of assistance, benefits, and privileges acknowledges the gravity of their plight and ensures that their families do not suffer further as a consequence of their loved ones' martyrdom in the struggle for justice.

Martyred mujahideen and mujahidat refer to those combatants who have lost their lives in the pursuit of ideological and nationalistic causes, and whose contributions are integral to the historical narrative of resistance and resilience within their communities. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that many of these brave individuals died during the struggle and thus were not decommissioned, meaning they have not formally laid down arms or transitioned to civilian life. Consequently, their families are deprived of the government benefits afforded to other mujahideen or mujahidat or combatants who have undergone documented decommissioning. This bill seeks to bridge that gap and ensure comprehensive support for these families, extending beyond the battlefield to provide them with dignity and respect.
