**AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE CONTINUED USE OF FUNDS FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF UNPAID OBLIGATIONS OF FY 2020 AND 2021 AND EXTENDING THE VALIDITY OF FY 2022 AND 2023 APPROPRIATIONS**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

By virtue of Executive Order No. 91, s. 2019, then President Rodrigo Roa Duterte mandated the nationwide shift from obligation-based budgeting to the Cash-Based Budgeting System (CBBS) in order to improve the fiscal planning of government agencies, speed up the implementation of programs, and promptly deliver goods and services to the people¹. However, in the process of implementing the CBBS, a global pandemic ensued leading to interruption in the performance of functions of all government agencies, including the efficient and judicious utilization of their respective budgets.

As a result, the Philippine Congress enacted Republic Act (R.A.) No. 11464 or an Act Extending the Availability of the 2019 Appropriations to December 31, 2020, R.A. No. 11520 or an Act Extending the Availability of the FY 2020 Appropriations to December 31, 2021, and R.A. No. 11640 or An Act Extending the Availability of the 2021 Appropriations to December 31, 2022. On the other hand, in R.A. No. 11639 or the General Appropriations Act for FY 2022, the availability of funds, except for personnel services, was generally set for two years or until December 31, 2023, and similarly in R. A. No. 11936 or the General Appropriations Act for FY 2023, the availability of funds, except for personnel services, was generally set for two years or until December 31, 2024.

The Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA), in its own effort to implement the CBBS likewise originally enacted its appropriation acts with a one-year period of availability of funds. However, experiencing the same delays felt by the national government in its own utilization of regional funds, it extended the availability thereof, the latest of which is through Bangsamoro Autonomy Act (BAA) No. 24 where the funds for FY 2020 were made available for obligation and disbursement until December 31, 2022 in the case of continuing programs under maintenance and other operating expenses (MOOE), and for obligation until December 31, 2022 and delivery, inspection, and payment until June 30, 2023 for infrastructure and capital outlays. Similarly, the funds for FY 2021 were made available for obligation and disbursement until December 31, 2022 for infrastructure capital outlay items, and for obligation until December 31, 2022 and delivery, inspection, and payment until June 30, 2023 for infrastructure and capital outlays.

In the same vein, the BTA enacted BAA No. 33 where funds for FY 2022, except for Personnel Services and General Administration and Support under MOOE, were made available for obligation until December 31, 2023 and for delivery, inspection, and payment until March 31, 2024 in the case of MOOE and other capital outlay items, and for obligation until December 31, 2023 and for completion of construction, inspection, and payment until June 30, 2024 in the case of infrastructure capital outlays.

On the other hand, BAA No. 32 or the General Appropriations Act for the Bangsamoro for FY 2023 provided for availability of funds for obligation until December 31, 2023, and for completion of construction, inspection, and payment of infrastructure capital outlays until June 30, 2024, and for delivery, inspection, and payment of MOOE and other capital outlays until March 31, 2024.

Amid all these, it bears stressing that while the objectives of the shift to CBBS are noble, in a note issued by the Philippine Institute for Development Studies, it observed that the CBBS could pose major problems to developing countries and transition economies, as developing countries “may not have the administrative capacity or other pre-requisites needed for the effective introduction” of such budget reforms².

Along this line, as a government in transition, in an area undergoing major reforms in its entire government system as it emerges from decades-long of violent conflict, and in view of the multiple anticipated causes for delay (including natural calamities, right of way problems,³ and prohibitions during electoral exercises) resulting in slower utilization of funds, the Bangsamoro Government has a far greater need than the national government to have its funds available for a longer period of time to ensure full delivery of goods and services intended to benefit its constituents.

Thus, the enactment of this essential piece of legislation is sought.
