**AN ACT DECLARING COTABATO CITY AS THE PERMANENT SEAT OF THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENT OF THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**Explanatory Note**

Section 1, Article VII of the Bangsamoro Organic Law provides that **“[t]he Parliament shall fix by law the permanent seat of the Bangsamoro Government anywhere within the territorial jurisdiction of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region taking into consideration accessibility and efficiency in which its mandate may be carried out under this Organic Law.”**

Moreover, Section 9, Chapter 2, Book I of the Bangsamoro Administrative Code that the seat of the Bangsamoro Government shall be in Cotabato City, unless otherwise provided by the Bangsamoro Parliament in the subsequent law.

The Bangsamoro Government Center located in Cotabato City hosts various key infrastructures that are significant, historic and symbolic of the Bangsamoro struggle. This includes the Office of the Chief Minister (formerly Office of the Regional Commissioner [ORC]), the Shariff Kabungsuan Cultural Complex (SKCC) with the Bangsamoro Museum and Regional Library, Bangsamoro Parliament building, and various offices.

Akin to the history of Cotabato City is the regional government center that has existed since the late 1970s, from the *Lupon Tagapagpaganap ng Pook* (LTP) moving to the Office of the Regional Commissioner, to the Office of the Regional Governor (ORG), and now the Office of the Chief Minister (OCM). Various Bangsamoro leaders have held their offices in the Cotabato City seat of the government, who welcomed several Philippine presidents from the late President Corazon Aquino, the late President Fidel V. Ramos, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, the late President Benigno S. Aquino, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, and now, President Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos, Jr. Several dignitaries of the multilateral organizations and diplomatic corps have set foot in the Cotabato City seat of government, who have witnessed peace and development undertakings in the autonomous government.

These are part of the historical narrative of the seat of the autonomous government in Cotabato City that we cannot undo nor ignore. It must be reinforced, promoted and developed in order to preserved and advanced the rich historical dimensions of the Bangsamoro in the Southern Philippines.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
