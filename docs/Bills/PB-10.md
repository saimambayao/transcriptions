**AN ACT**
**REQUIRING MUSLIM RESTAURANTS AND FOOD ESTABLISHMENTS WITHIN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM) TO SECURE HALAL CERTIFICATION AND PROVIDING PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS THEREOF**

**Explanatory Note**

As a Muslim region, it is a policy of the Bangsamoro Government to regulate the operations and maintenance of business establishments in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

Among these business establishments is the operation and maintenance of Muslim restaurants and other food establishments within the jurisdiction of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.

Halal foods are foods that Muslims are allowed to eat, drink, and consume. Shariah or Islamic Law specifies what foods are allowed and how these foods must be prepared.

Halal certification gives assurance to the consumers that the food products are produced according to the Shariah Law, and that they are also clean, hygienic, environmentally-friendly, and respects animal welfare.¹

Halal food is now a growing business industry in the BARMM economy, particularly in the urban centers of the autonomous region. To protect the health and well-being of BARMM constituents, it is the intention of this proposed bill to require Muslim restaurants and other food establishments within BARMM to secure Halal certification from appropriate agency of the government and penalties should be provided for the absence and/or violation thereof.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this legislative measure is earnestly sought.
