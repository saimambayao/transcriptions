**AN ACT**
**PROHIBITING THE MANUFACTURE, IMPORTATION, DISTRIBUTION, SALE, AND USE OF SINGLE-USE PLASTICS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION, PROVIDING FOR A TRANSITION PERIOD, ESTABLISHING IMPLEMENTATION MECHANISMS, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**Explanatory Note**

The unrestrained manufacture, sale, and use of single-use plastics (SUPs) has generated a global environmental crisis, with consequences that are both far-reaching and severe. In the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), the impacts are acutely felt in our rivers, shorelines, and upland ecosystems, where discarded plastics persist for centuries and disrupt livelihoods, biodiversity, and health systems.

Globally, the annual production of plastic exceeds 400 million metric tons, a large portion of which consists of disposable consumer products. In the Philippines, data from the National Tax Research Center (NTRC) indicate that plastic bags—predominantly made from high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE)—remain the most common and visible forms of single-use plastics. These are routinely used once, discarded improperly, and seldom recycled. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) further reports that among the most problematic SUPs are thin plastic bags, straws, stirrers, sachets, and expanded polystyrene containers—all of which are regularly found in landfills, waterways, and marine environments.

Scientific evidence demonstrates that plastic pollution poses a major threat to marine life, as plastic waste is often ingested by fish, birds, and sea turtles, leading to death and ecological imbalance. On land, microplastics degrade soil quality, affect freshwater systems, and contribute to climate change through open burning or decomposition in unmanaged dumpsites. A single plastic bag can take up to 500 years to decompose, releasing harmful chemicals into the environment in the process. Unless addressed, plastic pollution will continue to undermine the region's efforts toward sustainable development, ecological justice, and disaster risk reduction.

The 1987 Constitution mandates the State to protect and advance the right of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology. Republic Act No. 9003, or the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000, and Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law, reinforce this duty by requiring the adoption of environmentally sound policies and the institutionalization of localized environmental governance.

This legislative measure seeks to prohibit the manufacture, importation, distribution, sale, and use of single-use plastics in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. It establishes a one-year transition period to ensure that all stakeholders—including small businesses, retailers, and consumers—are capacitated to shift toward environmentally acceptable alternatives. The Act mandates the implementation of extended producer responsibility (EPR) among manufacturers and importers, encourages innovation in plastic-free packaging, and supports micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in their transition through technical and financial incentives.

It is worth noting that some local government units across the Philippines have already pioneered ordinances to restrict SUPs. Cities such as Davao and municipalities like Palanan have demonstrated that such regulations can be implemented effectively and equitably, given proper education, enforcement, and collaboration. This bill builds on those best practices and ensures that enforcement mechanisms, exemptions for essential uses, and public education programs are institutionalized through an implementing framework grounded in participatory governance.

The passage of this Act is not merely an environmental imperative—it is a moral and intergenerational duty. Through this measure, the Bangsamoro Government takes a firm stand for ecological integrity, human dignity, and the sustainable future of our region.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this measure is earnestly sought.
