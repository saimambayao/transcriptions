**AN ACT CREATING AND ESTABLISHING THE BANGSAMORO CLIMATE CHANGE COMMISSION, DEFINING ITS POWERS AND FUNCTIONS, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Bangsamoro Government is mandated under Section 2, Article XIII of the Bangsamoro Organic Law, to protect and improve the quality of life of its inhabitants. Therefore, any development in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region must be carefully planned, taking into account the ecological balance and availability of natural resources for present and future generations. Moreover, Section 7 of the same Article emphasizes that the Bangsamoro Government, in compliance with the “Climate Change Act of 2009”, must ensure that its constituent local government units formulate their respective local climate change action plans for the proper and effective implementation thereof.

Research shows that the Philippines is the third most affected country by climate change. The effects of climate change in the country are substantial, including changes in rainfall patterns, droughts, risks to biodiversity and food security, rising sea levels, threats to public health, changing landscapes, fires, floods, and storms, as well as climate-related diseases. Consequently, the vulnerability of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region and its local communities, especially the disadvantaged groups such as the poor, women, and children, should be acknowledged in relation to the potential dangerous consequences of climate change.

Furthermore, the effects of climate change in the Bangsamoro territory are not mere hypothesis, but numerous disastrous incidents have already been reported. The region has experienced significant damage from typhoons, floods, and similar events, leading to extreme changes in the lives of individuals and communities.

Therefore, it is of primordial importance for the Bangsamoro Government to intervene and mitigate the effects of climate change. It should establish and institutionalize policies, initiatives, plans, and programs dedicated to addressing climate change. It is for these reasons that the approval of this bill is earnestly sought after.

Declaration of Policy.** — It shall be the policy of the Bangsamoro Government to develop a comprehensive framework for sustainable development through the proper conservation, utilization and development of natural resources, which shall guide it in adopting program and policy mechanisms that focus on the environment dimensions of social and economic interventions. It shall include measures for environmental justice and governance, as well as for the reduction of the vulnerability of women and marginalized groups to climate change and variability.

The Bangsamoro Government recognizes the importance of disaster risk reduction and management and climate change adaptation.

**Section 3. Definition of Terms.** — For purposes of this Act, the following shall mean:

(a) “Adaptation” refers to the adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities.
(b) “Adaptive capacity” refers to the ability of ecological, social or economic systems to adjust to climate change including climate variability and extremes, to moderate or offset potential damages and to take advantage of associated opportunities with changes in climate or to cope with the consequences thereof.
(c) “Climate Change” refers to a change in climate that can be identified by changes in the mean and/or variability of its properties and that persists for an extended period typically decades or longer, whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity.
(d) “Climate Variability” refers to the variations in the average state and in other statistics of the climate on all temporal and spatial scales beyond that of individual weather events.
(e) “Disaster” refers to a serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society involving widespread human, material, economic or environmental loss and impact which exceed the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources.
(f) “Disaster risk reduction” refers to the concept and practice of reducing disaster risks through systematic efforts to analyze and manage the causal factors of disasters, including through reduced exposure to hazards, lessened vulnerability of people and property, wise management of land and the environment, and improved preparedness for adverse events.
(g) “Greenhouse effect” refers to the process by which the absorption of infrared radiation by the atmosphere warms the Earth.
(h) “Greenhouse gases (GHG)” refers to constituents of the atmosphere that contribute to the greenhouse effect including, but not limited to, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.
(i) “Mainstreaming” refers to the integration of policies and measures that address climate change into development planning and sectoral decision-making.
(j) “Mitigation” in the context of climate change, refers to human intervention to address anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all GHG, including ozone-depleting substances and their substitutes.
(k) “Vulnerability” refers to the degree to which a system is susceptible to, or unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of the character, magnitude, and rate of climate change and variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity.
