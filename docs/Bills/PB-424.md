**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Bangsamoro Government is currently implementing various programs and projects that require the procurement of food, goods, materials, and supplies. However, due to restrictive procurement policies, limited market access, and the dominance of trade monopolies, many local farmers, fisherfolk, and local producers and suppliers remain excluded from participating as suppliers or producers in these initiatives.

Actively involving local farmers, fisherfolk, and local producers and suppliers in procurement processes can provide them with direct access to institutional markets, ensure fair pricing, and eliminate the role of unscrupulous middlemen in the supply chain. This not only enhances their incomes but also improves their overall livelihoods and economic resilience.

By institutionalizing market access—providing a guaranteed avenue for local farmers, fisherfolk, and local producers and suppliers to sell their produce—they can enjoy a sustained source of income, which in turn increases their purchasing power and strengthens the local economy. A stable and reliable market reduces post-harvest losses, decreases food wastage, and contributes to long-term food security. It also encourages increased production and reinforces their role as key partners of the government in regional economic development.

One viable strategy to achieve this is through negotiated procurement via community participation, as allowed under government procurement policies. This approach allows for the direct engagement of organized local communities, particularly farmers and fisherfolk, in procurement planning and implementation. It ensures that procurement becomes an inclusive tool for equitable growth, allowing the benefits of public investment to reach marginalized groups and address systemic food insecurity in the region.

In line with this, it is the policy of the Bangsamoro Government to promote domestic trade preference for goods produced and materials sourced within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. It also supports the adoption of measures that enhance the competitiveness of local producers and suppliers.

Negotiated procurement through community participation encourages community organization and empowers them to take part in procurement processes—whether in planning, bidding, contracting, or implementation. Communities may act as contractors or service providers, ensuring that the social objectives of procurement are achieved, and that project ownership and sustainability are strengthened.

By harnessing the skills, knowledge, and local resources of Bangsamoro communities, the government can build a sustainable food system, stimulate local economic development, and promote the overall well-being of its people.
