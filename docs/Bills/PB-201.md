**Explanatory Note**

Section 19 (1), Article XIV of the 1987 Constitution states that the State shall promote physical education and encourage sports programs, league competitions, and amateur sports, including training for international competitions, to foster self-discipline, teamwork, and excellence for the development of a healthy and alert citizenry.

Section 13, Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall recognize the vital role of the youth in nation-building, promote and protect their physical, moral, spiritual, and nationalism, encourage involvement in public and civic affairs, and promote mental and physical fitness through sports. Section 20 of the same article provides that the Bangsamoro educational system shall encourage and supports programs, league competitions, indigenous games, martial arts, and amateur sports including training for regional, national, and international competitions.

Many Bangsamoro individuals have aced examinations and won competitions both at the national and international levels. These achievements have brought so much pride and honor to the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. Achieving any accomplishment, may it be national or international, should be recognized and awarded. Not only should any impressive feat be publicly acknowledged, but such achievements should be rewarded as these Bangsamoro individuals have undergone and faced many hardships and pressures. In addition, the recognition of the exemplary performance of these individuals would inspire the Bangsamoro youth, young professionals, and other aspirants in the Bangsamoro Region to strive harder in order to excel in their chosen endeavor, aiming for greater heights of excellence.

One way of acknowledging their achievements is through a grant of an incentive, whether through cash or an award given by the Bangsamoro Government. It is a way of giving back to the extraordinary acts of service and exceptional contributions rendered by them that brought pride and honor to the region. The perseverance, dedication and courage of these achievers is worthy of emulation by the entire Bangsamoro populace, most especially the youth. It is said that the youth are the present, in as much as they are our future. An empowered young person has the confidence to try on new things and take risks, which gives the youth the power to believe in themselves and recognize their capabilities, and to remind them that no dream is too big, and no goal is impossible to achieve. In addition, this can encourage them to dream bigger, push harder and live a more fulfilling life.

The Bangsamoro Government has been recognizing the feats of our region and consistently expressing its support and congratulations for the Bangsamoro individuals through the filing of resolutions that honor them. It is the time to step a notch higher and honor these individuals in a much more meaningful way through this legislative act.

In recognition of the exceptional feat of these Bangsamoro individuals, incentives and awards should be given to reward their hard work, patience, determination and countless days of sacrifice.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
