**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The State recognizes the right of the Filipino people to information and its importance in nation-building, as provided for in the Philippine Constitution¹, to wit:

> **Section 24. The State recognizes the vital role of communication and information in nation-building.**
>

> **Section 28. Subject to reasonable conditions prescribed by law, the State adopts and implements a policy of full public disclosure of all its transactions involving public interest.**
>

> **Section 7. The right of the people to information on matters of public concern shall be recognized. Access to official records, and to documents, and papers pertaining to official acts, transactions, or decisions, as well as to government research data used as basis for policy development, shall be afforded the citizen, subject to such limitations as may be provided by law.**

Executive Order No. 2, s. 2016, signed by President Rodrigo Duterte, further operationalizes the people’s constitutional right to information and the state policies to full public disclosure and transparency in public service.

The Official Gazette, which is the official journal of the Republic of the Philippines, was first published and released on September 10, 1902, by virtue of the decree of Act No. 453². Subsequent laws and issuances throughout the years have provided for a more uniform publication and distribution of the Official Gazette, through Act No. 664, Commonwealth Act No. 638, Executive Order No. 200, s. 1987, the Administrative Code of 1987³, and Executive Order No. 4, s. 2010.

While the former Bureau of Public Information no doubt updated the public of the regional government’s latest programs and projects, it was still lacking in its function to inform the public of all the legislation approved by the ARMM-Regional Legislative Assembly.

The passage of the Bangsamoro Administrative Code, while it did not specifically state as to how the Bangsamoro Gazette would be published, nevertheless requires its establishment⁴. It is therefore submitted that it is high time and apt for the Bangsamoro Government to publish its own official gazette to be published in print and electronic form.

The Supreme Court ruling from the case of *Tañada. et al. vs. Tuvera, et al.* (G.R. No. 63915, December 29, 1986) mandated that publication in the Official Gazette was necessary to give the public adequate notice, and that unpublished issuances would have no force and effect. This gave way to Executive Order No. 200, s. 1987, which provided that official publication would be either through the Official Gazette or newspapers of general circulation, given the Gazette’s limited readership at the time.

However, the Official Gazette went online on July 26, 2010. Manolo Quezon III, then Undersecretary of the Presidential Communications Development and Strategic Planning Office, envisioned the website to digitize all past and future editions of the Official Gazette with full searchability of the Gazette’s database⁵.

While there is still a digital divide especially due to lack of internet infrastructures in the Bangsamoro, the advent of affordable smartphones, social media, and free data has greatly increased the country’s number of internet users. In 2011, internet users nationwide numbered at 29,700,000 or just 32% of the total population, with mobile penetration at around 94%⁶. Today, both statistics have increased, standing at 67% for internet penetration and 138.2% for mobile penetration⁷ (given that several users have more than one mobile device).

The Bangsamoro Organic Law enshrines the Bangsamoro’s right to self-governance⁸, the right to participate in political processes⁹, and the right of access to basic services¹⁰. Indeed, it can be argued that the Bangsamoro people cannot fully participate in political processes, nor practice their right to self-governance, without first being granted access to information.

It is therefore of vital importance that the public be informed on matters of public concerns through platforms that are easily accessible, as internet users continue to increase, and electronic publication becomes the norm for faster and wider dissemination of information. Through this measure, the Bangsamoro Government guarantees its framework of moral governance, transparency, fairness, and full and appropriate disclosure.

In view of the foregoing, the support of all the Members of the Parliament for the prompt passage of this measure is earnestly sought.
