**AN ACT ESTABLISHING BANGSAMORO PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT CENTERS IN SULU, BASILAN, TAWI-TAWI AND LANAO DEL SUR, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

This bill mandates the establishment of Government Centers in Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, Basilan, and Lanao del Sur.

Experience from across the world shows that bringing the government closer to constituents has a positive impact on reducing poverty and inequality, accelerating rural development, and enhancing the participation of citizens in their development. Studies have highlighted the impact that proximity can have on unlocking the potential of regions, improving services to people, and stimulating citizen participation in decision-making.¹

At present, some of the provincial offices of the Bangsamoro Government are occupying buildings on a lease, which are usually far from each other, due to the unavailability of spaces and the absence of a single Government Center. In some cases, the offices are situated in an area or building which is not even visible to the public. The present setup adversely affects not only the constituents but the government itself in terms of advantage, feasibility, and practicality.

By establishing a government center in a single area that will house the buildings of the provincial offices of the various ministries, commissions, offices, as well as the satellite offices of the Members of the Parliament, the Bangsamoro government as a whole will be more accessible and responsive to the needs of its constituents.

Likewise, the establishment of facilities in various provinces will allow the Bangsamoro Government to adopt *space planning*, which involves the establishment of specific use for different areas within facilities. In government buildings, it means pairing the capabilities of space with the demands of the people coming to them. This involves a more in-depth understanding of operations. For example, there are government facilities that do not have a receiving area for their clients and visitors. Government space planning satisfies the criteria for accessibility and efficiency. Coordinating space paves the way for significant benefits, which include government facilities becoming more accessible to constituents; government employees having the space they need to do their jobs; cost to taxpayers drops as facility efficiency conserves funds; fewer overlaps and interruptions in facilities ensuring smooth operations; enhanced safety, security, and privacy in well-orchestrated spaces; easier navigability and wayfinding in well-organized facilities.

Under this bill, Government Centers will be established in various provinces of the Bangsamoro region to serve as one-stop shops that enable citizens to access various government services without having to travel to the regional offices in Cotabato City. The establishment of Centers also aims to improve citizens' interaction with government institutions, help increase public awareness of government policies and regulations, and strengthen citizens' oversight of the use of public resources.²

As the Bangsamoro Transition Authority builds the foundations of the Bangsamoro Government, policies and programs must reflect the full panoply of society’s interests. Informing and responding to citizens will raise the government’s effectiveness by improving the monitoring of public goods and services and forcing greater transparency in decision-making.³

The Centers will serve as an important vehicle for ensuring no one is left behind, a key principle for attaining sustainable development goals.

In view of the foregoing, the immediate passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
