**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

South Ubian is a 3rd class coastal municipality in the province of Tawi-Tawi. It has a population of more or less 29,583 people in a land area of around 27,204 hectares. Its most recently published poverty incidence is 25.27% per Philipine Statistics Authority. Their most proximate access to medical services is a health center in the island of Tabawan headed by a nurse and five (5) Barangay health stations in in the municipality headed by midwives. Obviously, the medical services and facilities the center and the stations can provide is grossly inadequate for lack of even a doctor and basic medical equipments. Those who need to avail of proper medical services have to travel all the way to Bongao, the capital of Tawi-Tawi, where the Datu Halun Sakilan Memorial Hospital is situated. The only mode of public transportation is by motor launch or "lantsa" which is only scheduied to depart three times a week. They have to desperately traverse around 96 km of the perils of the sea for 8 to 10 hours usually while in a condition not fit for travel. There were many instances of fatalities while in transit and upon arrival in Bongao because of these conditions. It is the legal and moral responsibility of the Bangsamoro Government to alleviate the plight of these people and provide them their basic right to life, health, and medical services. It is high time that the dividends of peace reach even our most remote and isolated islands.

Section 8, Article IX of the Bangsamoro Organic Law states that "the Bangsamoro Government shall provide, maintain, and ensure the delivery of basic and responsive health programs... to the Bangsamoro people and other inhabitants of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region." Section 22, Article IX of the same law further enunciates that "the Bangsamoro Government shall adopt a policy on health that provides for a comprehensive and integrated health service delivery for its constituents. It shall establish by law a general hospital system to serve the health requirements of its people and ensure that the individual's basic right to life shall be attainable through the prompt intervention of excellent and affordable medical services." The Bangsamoro Organic iaw aptiy emphasizes the importance and priority of providing health services by stating in Section 19, Article XII on Fiscal Autonomy that "the Parliament shall assign the highest budgetary priority to education, health, and social services as may be provided in its appropriations law.

Ergo, it cannot be overstated, that the establishment of a leve 1 general hospital in the Municipality of South Ubian is a necessity for its constituents to live a humane quality of life. I am sure that we have more places in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region that have needed the same for a very long time. It may be long overdue, but the establishment of this hospital is a torch of hope lit in a small island in Tawi-Tawi, the luminescence of which will reach even the furthest areas of our region. This time, nobody will be left behind.
