**AN ACT CREATING THE BUREAU OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNDER THE MINISTRY OF TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATION**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

In this day and age, where most transactions can be dealt with at the touch of our smartphone or laptop screens, connectivity is no longer a want but is simply a need for everyone. Our gadgets have become our gateway to an endless stream of possibilities that are available on the internet. From communicating with our loved ones to making business transactions and even accepting payments for jobs done, almost all transactions nowadays can be done with the slab of glass and alloy that we carry around in our pockets. With the age of Information and Communication Technology at its apex, a location, nay a region, with many territories devoid of reliable mobile phone signal, is nothing short of a sin. Sadly, that is our status quo in BARMM.

Based on the National ICT Household Survey in 2019, BARMM maintains the highest number of communities without cell phone signals among all the regions in the Philippines, with only 13.2% of the survey respondents admitting to having used the internet for the last three months. Only 4.5% of the households in BARMM also responded to having broadband internet at home. At the same time, most respondents clocked in with having to suffer through the most basic 2G signal as it is the only one available in their community.¹

Although we have an officer assigned to the ICT needs of our region, their powers and functions are too generalized at best, with the office catering only to the most rudimentary policymaking measures related to ICT in the region. It is high time that ICT becomes a focal point in the progress of the Bangsamoro with the Bureau empowered by law to formulate strategies to better the ICT status of our region.

This bill proposes many approaches to handling, developing, and improving the lives of the Bangsamoro People through better access to ICT infrastructures. Further, it also provides for the requisite cybersecurity plans in order to prevent any and all forms of breaches in cybersecurity all over the region to keep up with the ever-dynamic need to secure our database from potential exploiters. A deadline to provide free internet access in all public areas of the Bangsamoro Region is also codified in order to give us a nudge to carry out this undertaking and make it a priority for the benefit of the Bangsamoro People.

With the establishment of the Bureau of Information and Communications Technology under the Ministry of Transportation and Communication, a future where better accessibility of ICT services in Bangsamoro is one giant leap closer to fruition.
