**AN ACT STREAMLINING RELATED BANGSAMORO COMMISSIONS, THEREBY MERGING AND RESTRUCTURING SUCH COMMISSIONS INTO ONE ENTITY TO BE KNOWN AS BANGSAMORO COMMISSION ON WOMEN, YOUTH, AND SPORTS (BC-WYS), AMENDING TITLE XVI, CHAPTERS 1-3 OF THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMY ACT NO. 13, DEFINING ITS POWERS AND FUNCTIONS, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREOF, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**Explanatory Note**

The three (3) commissions, namely the Bangsamoro Women Commission (BWC), Bangsamoro Youth Commission (BYC), and Bangsamoro Sports Commission (BSC), have, in one way or another, common target beneficiaries. It is in this context that the agenda for women, youth, and sports must be synchronized and coordinated, which shall be charted in one road map. They must not be treated in isolation to each other, as the youth can be women, and the women and youth can also be involved in sports.

Moreover, the Ministry of Social Services and Development (MSSD) has its Children and Youth Welfare Program (CYWP) and Women’s Welfare Program (WWP) and the Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education (MBHTE) has its programs on sports development and gender empowerment intended for learners for all levels of education.

In line with the rightsizing policy of His Excellency President Ferdinand “Bongbong” R. Marcos, Jr. as articulated in his State of the Nation (SONA) address, the Bangsamoro Government needs to review its policies and issuances.

President Marcos, Jr. said in his SONA that rightsizing is a reform mechanism that seeks to enhance the government’s institutional capacity to perform its mandate and provide better services, while ensuring optimal and efficient use of resources. It will entail a comprehensive strategic review of the functions, operations, organization, systems and processes of the different agencies concerned, such as mergers, consolidation, splitting, transfer, and even the abolition of some offices.

Section 8, Article XVI of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) provides for the interim cabinet with 15 ministries and offices for youth, women and few other offices and Art. VII, Section 42, Article VII also provides that [T]he Parliament may create other offices such as for the youth, women, and other offices.

Section 11, Article IX provides that “[t]he Parliament shall create by law a commission on women and shall define its powers, functions, and composition.”

Section 12, Article IX provides that “[t]he Bangsamoro Government shall uphold and protect the fundamental rights of women, including the right to engage in lawful employment, and to be protected from exploitation, abuse, or discrimination, as embodied in the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women. The Parliament shall enact the necessary laws for the implementation of this section.”

Section 13, Article IX states that “[t]he Bangsamoro Government shall recognize the vital role of the youth in nation-building, promote and protect their physical, moral, spiritual, intellectual, and social well-being. It shall inculcate patriotism and nationalism, encourage involvement in public and civic affairs, and promote mental and physical fitness through sports. The Parliament shall create by law a commission on youth affairs and shall define its powers, functions, and composition.”

Section 20, Article IX provides that “[t]he Parliament shall pass a law creating a Bangsamoro Sports Commission.”

Section 20, Article XII of provides that “[t]he total appropriations, whether annual or supplemental, for Personal Services of the Bangsamoro Government for one (1) fiscal year shall not exceed forty-five percent (45%) of the total revenue sources of the Bangsamoro Government.”

Based on the 2022 General Appropriations Act of the Bangsamoro (GAAB), the three Commissions has a total cumulative budget of P217.635 million, of which 52.14 percent comprising personal services. Each of the three commissions have their respective chair, four (4) commissioners, and field offices, that requires operation maintenance. The personal services is no longer compliant to the requirement of the BOL so much so with the operation and maintenance requirements.

The major source of revenue of the Bangsamoro is the block grant. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with the implementation of the *Mandanas* Supreme Court ruling, the block grant is expected to decrease by 2023.

In keeping with the rightsizing policy of the President Marcos, and in order to lessen the costs of maintenance of the three commissions, all while improving their capacity to perform their mandate, the three must be merged and restructured into one.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
