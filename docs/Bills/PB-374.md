**AN ACT ESTABLISHING A COMMUNITY-BASED PHYSICAL AND REHABILITATION MEDICINE (CBPRM) PROGRAM IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO, PROVIDING FOR DECENTRALIZED, ACCESSIBLE, AND INCLUSIVE REHABILITATIVE HEALTH SERVICES, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Access to rehabilitation is not a privilege but a fundamental component of the right to health. The World Health Organization (WHO) underscores that at least **1 in 3 people worldwide** requires rehabilitation at some point in their lives, yet **more than half** do not receive the services they need, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.¹

In the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), the need for rehabilitation is not only widespread—it is also urgent. BARMM continues to experience a disproportionately high burden of untreated injuries, post-stroke disability, congenital and developmental impairments, and war-related trauma. Despite this, rehabilitation remains one of the least accessible health services in the region.

According to the Department of Health and World Bank, BARMM consistently ranks lowest in health outcome indicators. Life expectancy in BARMM is estimated at **63.2 years**—the lowest among all Philippine regions, compared to the **national average of 71.3 years.**² Rehabilitation services, where available, are mostly centralized in a few urban tertiary facilities and largely inaccessible to rural populations, particularly in conflict-affected or geographically isolated areas.

Furthermore, the shortage of trained rehabilitation professionals is staggering. As of 2023, the Philippines continues to face a national shortage of rehabilitation professionals, including Physiatrists, Physical Therapists, and Occupational Therapists. These gaps are even more pronounced in underserved and conflict-affected regions, where many municipalities have limited or no access to physical medicine and rehabilitation services. This severe human resource gap results in long delays in care, poor recovery outcomes for stroke survivors, and unmet rehabilitation needs among children with disabilities and elderly persons. The situation is compounded by poor infrastructure, intermittent transport links, and LGU-level capacity limitations in service delivery.

² World Bank. (2023). Philippine Human Capital Review.


According to the 2020 Census, senior citizens comprise **only 3.8%** of BARMM’s total population—approximately **166,700 individuals.**³ While this is lower than the national average of 8.5%, it reflects underlying trends of high fertility and lower life expectancy rather than lower need. As health outcomes improve and the elderly population grows, there is a critical need to invest in age-appropriate rehabilitative care, fall prevention, and functional independence for older adults.

The current system in BARMM lacks an institutionalized, region-wide program for community-based rehabilitation. While some LGUs and NGOs have piloted mobile or home-based models, these efforts are often fragmented, unsustained, or unsupported by policy and budget. Without a dedicated framework, rehabilitation remains sidelined in the regional health strategy.

This bill seeks to establish the **Bangsamoro Community-Based Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine (CBPRM) Program**—a culturally respectful, decentralized, and inclusive model of delivering rehabilitation services across the region. The CBPRM model includes fixed-site services, mobile outreach teams, and home-based rehabilitation for the bedridden and functionally impaired. It also empowers community health workers and caregivers as support actors in delivering and sustaining care.

The CBPRM Program shall be operationalized through a multi-level structure: from the Ministry of Health (MOH) to Integrated Provincial Health Offices (IPHOs), down to municipal-level focal persons in partnership with Municipal Health Offices (MHOs). While respecting LGU autonomy, the bill includes fallback provisions to ensure that rehabilitation services can reach even the most underserved areas when local capacity is absent.

This measure is aligned with national and global mandates. It supports the implementation of **Republic Act No. 11223** or the Universal Health Care Act, which affirms the right to rehabilitation as part of the health continuum. It advances the guarantees of **Republic Act No. 7277** or the Magna Carta for Persons with Disabilities, which mandates equal access to rehabilitative care. It fulfills the spirit of **Republic Act No. 11054**, the Bangsamoro Organic Law, by establishing a regional program responsive to local health realities and cultural contexts. It also adheres to WHO’s Rehabilitation 2030 strategy calling for rehabilitation integration at all levels of health systems.⁴

More than a health measure, this bill is a commitment to equity and social justice. It ensures that **stroke survivors, persons with disabilities, conflict survivors, and elderly Bangsamoro residents** receive not just clinical care—but the chance to regain function, live with dignity, and participate in community life.

By institutionalizing CBPRM in BARMM, the Bangsamoro Government asserts that healing, recovery, and inclusion must extend to every barangay, not just hospital corridors.

In light of the foregoing, the immediate passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
