**AN ACT ESTABLISHING AN EMERGENCY RUNWAY INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM IN ALL PROVINCES OF THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION, AND PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Disasters brought by natural hazards and conflict is observed to have increased in frequency in the recent past years.

Apart from the effects of climate change and the persistent conflict in the region, the COVID-19 pandemic proved that our region has yet to develop mechanisms building up on our resilience. Improvements on the aspect of preparedness, response, recovery, rehabilitation, and adaptation are yet to be seen in our region.

This measure proposes the establishment and maintenance of emergency runway infrastructure on all the provinces in the region. The flight operations this infrastructure support is intended to help reinforce humanitarian or emergency responses.

It is aimed at filling critical gaps by facilitating the delivery of humanitarian aid, emergency assistance, and the transport of humanitarian staff on all the provinces. Generally, it will improve the accessibility for quick response operations. It may also be important on instances that would require evacuation.

The recent pandemic brought about huge logistical challenges for the response, including the absence of commercial flights due to transport restrictions.

This emergency infrastructure ensures the continuation of humanitarian assistance and the delivery of essential supplies to affected areas in the region, among others.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
