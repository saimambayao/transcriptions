**“AN ACT CREATING THE BANGSAMORO COMMISSION ON POPULATION MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFORE, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES”**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

“Hundreds of millions of women around the world are still not using modern contraceptives to prevent unwanted pregnancies, and global targets on reducing maternal deaths have not been met”.

*-International Conference on Population and Development*

“Women and girls must be free from the threats of maternal mortality, gender based violence and harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation. And they must have the opportunity to decide on the number and timing of their children”.

*-Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, UNFPA Executive Director*

According to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) 2020 Census Population and Housing result, BARMM recorded 4,404,288 Million, with a 3.26 % increase from 2.89% in 2015.¹ Moreover, the projected population of PSA from 2010 to 2045 shows that the Bangsamoro Region will have the highest average annual growth rate of 2.12 percent ² and with the additional indicator in 2017 of the fertility rate of 3.1%.³

The Philippine Government created the Commission on Population (POPCOM) by virtue of Republic Act 6365 enacted on August 15, 1971 an act establishing a national policy on population and amended by Presidential Decree 79, Section 3, on December 8, 1972 is hereby mandated as the over-all coordinating, monitoring and policy making body of the population program. It is the lead agency promoting population activities.

President Gloria M. Arroyo issued an Executive Order (EO) 188 on March 24, 2003, attaching POPCOM to the Department of Health (DOH). The issuance of EO 188 calls for unified, consistent, and integrated implementation of the population program, which will lead to consistency of policies, and programs particularly in population management, reproductive health and family planning.

The POPCOM XII takes charge of the population program for both Region XII and ARMM, being complemented by DOH ARMM in 2010. In view of the passage and ratification of Republic Act No. 11054, it is imperative to create the counterpart of the Population Commission in BARMM region to be consistent with the structure, powers and functions of the Bangsamoro Government, and responsive to the needs of the constituents of the region.

The integration of population concerns in development has long been recognized internationally and nationally. In 1967, the United Nation Declaration of Population stated that the population problem is a principal element in long-range national planning. This declaration was seconded by the World Population Conference in Bucharest in 1974 which stated in its World Population Plan of Action that “*the essential aim of the population program is the social, economic and cultural development of countries; it recognizes that population variables and development are interdependent; and that population policies and objectives are an integral part (constituent elements) of socioeconomic development policies*”.

The creation seeks, in the long term, to enable institutions to create an enabling environment for people to achieve their development goals through a well-managed population. Having a well-managed population means the achievement of population processes and outcomes that are consistent with, complementary to, and facilitative of socioeconomic and human development of the region.

Furthermore, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte signed to law the Executive Order No. 141, entitled “Adopting as a National Priority the Implementation of Measures to Address the Root Causes of the Rising Number of Teenage Pregnancies, and Mobilizing Government Agencies for the Purpose”. The section 5 of EO 141, mentioned that “*POPCOM shall continue to educate leaders, parents, and other community members about evidenced-based strategies to reduce, if not eliminate, adolescent pregnancy, and improve adolescent reproductive health*”.

Moreover, the Regional Plan of Action for Nutrition (RPAN) 2020-2022 with an additional nutrition-specific program, the Adolescent Health Program, to reflect the huge challenge of adolescent health, and in particular, adolescent pregnancy, where the prevalence for BARMM represents the highest in the Philippines. The access to and use of modern contraceptive methods is another area where BARMM lags behind national prevalence rates. BARMM’s contraceptive prevalence rate appears to be very low at 19% for women aged 15 to 49 using any modern method of family planning compared with the rest of the regions of the country (*see Figure 1*). Naturally, a low average on use of contraception in the region heightens the risk of early pregnancy, which is closely similar to national trends with 2.2 percent of women already sexually active before the age of 15.

**Use of Modern Methods**
Percent of married women age 15-49 using any modern method of family planning
Philippines: **40%**
ARMM: **19%**

*Figure 1. Percent of Married Women Age 15-49 using any Modern Method of Family Planning, 2017 NDHS*

The National Demographic Health Survey (NDHS) data reveal that among women age 15-24 in BARMM, 24.4 percent have begun childbearing, a percentage lower than the national average of 27 percent. In addition to the impact on fertility, birth intervals also affect the health of mothers and their children. The median birth interval in BARMM is 28.5%.

As such, it is deemed necessary to create the office of Bangsamoro Commission on Population Management and Development to ensure an improved mechanism and support to strengthen the implementation of the Philippine Population Management Program in BARMM.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
