**AN ACT INSTITUTIONALIZING AND STRENGTHENING CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS’ (CSO) ENGAGEMENT IN GOVERNANCE IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO, ESTABLISHING THE BANGSAMORO CSO COORDINATING OFFICE, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Section 23, Article II of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides that “*the participation of non-governmental, community-based, and other sectoral organizations shall be encouraged by the State.*” Section 16, Article XIII further guarantees the right of the people and their organizations to effective and reasonable participation at all levels of social, political, and economic decision-making, and mandates the State to establish adequate consultation mechanisms.

Section 10, Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), affirms this constitutional mandate by institutionalizing participatory governance and requiring the involvement of civil society organizations (CSOs) in shaping regional development policies. This is reinforced by Section 34 of Republic Act No. 7160, or the Local Government Code of 1991, which recognizes CSOs and people’s organizations as partners of local governments in peacebuilding, development, and governance. Section 2(c), Chapter I of Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 49, or the Bangsamoro Local Governance Code of 2023, further strengthens participatory mechanisms within BARMM’s unique political context.

Building upon these constitutional and statutory foundations, the *Mapping Study on Civil Society Organizations’ Engagement with the Bangsamoro Government* (The Asia Foundation, 2023) revealed that CSO participation across ministries remains fragmented, sector-specific, and inconsistent. The study recommended the establishment of a centralized and dedicated institution to act as a hub for CSO engagement—standardizing accreditation, facilitating collaboration, and ensuring equitable access to government programs and support, particularly for grassroots organizations and those in geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas (GIDAs).

The Bangsamoro Government acknowledges that CSOs—especially those composed of and led by community members—possess deep knowledge of local realities and are uniquely positioned to design and implement projects that directly respond to community needs. Embedding project implementation within communities enhances accountability, transparency, and public trust, while fostering peace-responsive and inclusive development.

In response, this proposed measure seeks to create the **Bangsamoro CSO Coordinating Office (BCCO)** as the central institutional mechanism for harmonizing CSO-government engagement. The BCCO will maintain a comprehensive and regularly updated database of community needs and CSO initiatives to enable evidence-based planning, coordinate funding alignment with priority initiatives, and develop clear accreditation and partnership guidelines. Through these mechanisms, CSO participation will become more systematic, inclusive, and impactful—promoting moral governance, accountability, and citizen-centered development.

The bill was crafted through an extensive and inclusive consultative process. This included inception meetings, thematic focus group discussions, consultations with legal experts, sectoral and regional consultations, and consolidation workshops. These engagements ensured the meaningful participation of grassroots organizations, traditional leaders, women’s and youth groups, faith-based institutions, and local communities across BARMM.

Crucially, the consultations highlighted the invaluable contributions of Indigenous Peoples (IPs) to the Bangsamoro region—through their cultural wisdom, stewardship of ancestral domains, and contributions to peacebuilding and community resilience. This measure affirms the importance of recognizing IPs, respecting their rights, and guaranteeing their representation in decision-making processes that affect their lives, lands, and the Bangsamoro region as a whole.

Global evidence demonstrates that institutionalizing citizen participation yields measurable benefits. OECD research finds that open government and structured participation are strongly correlated with higher public trust in government institutions (OECD, 2021). Participatory budgeting in Brazil redirected resources toward basic services and led to significant reductions in infant mortality (Avritzer, 2009). Ukraine’s *ProZorro* e-procurement platform—co-developed by government, business, and CSOs—delivered substantial fiscal savings and enhanced transparency in public contracting (OECD, 2017). Global syntheses from the World Bank (2017) and the Open Government Partnership (2020) affirm that inclusive, rules-based participation strengthens accountability, improves service delivery, and deepens democratic outcomes.

At its core, this Act institutionalizes the BCCO as the principal mechanism for government–CSO coordination and engagement—ensuring that CSOs, including grassroots communities, faith-based organizations, and Indigenous Peoples, are not merely consulted but empowered as co-creators in governance and development.

The principal author has long championed civil society empowerment and reaffirms his commitment to advancing the rights, participation, and partnership of CSOs and IPs in moral governance. The successful drafting of this measure was made possible through the active engagement of the civil society community and the technical guidance of the Policy Research and Legal Services (PRLS) of the Bangsamoro Parliament.

In view of the foregoing, the immediate passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
