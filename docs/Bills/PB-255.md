**AN ACT**
**MANDATING THE CREATION OF ONE SPECIAL NEEDS EDUCATION (SPED) CENTER PER MUNICIPALITY/CITY IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM), APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**Explanatory Note**

Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that, "*Everyone has the right to education.*"

Under the 1987 Constitution, Section 1 of Article XIV asserts that "*the State shall protect and promote the rights of all citizens to quality education at all levels and shall take appropriate steps to make such education accessible to all*".

This is also reiterated in Section 8, Article IX of the Republic Act No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), which states that the "*The Bangsamoro Government shall provide, maintain, and ensure the delivery of basic and responsive health programs, quality education, appropriate services, livelihood opportunities, affordable and progressive housing projects, power and electricity, and water inhabitants of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.*"

Also enshrined in Section 16, Article IX of the BOL is the priority of the Bangsamoro Government to "*establish, maintain, and support a complete and integrated system of quality education, which shall be a subsystem of the national education system*". Where the "*Bangsamoro Government shall develop an educational framework relevant and responsive to the needs, ideals, and aspirations of the Bangsamoro people. For this purpose, the Bangsamoro Government shall conform to the minimum standards set by the National Government*".

Every Bangsamoro must have easy and unobstructed access to quality education. The Bangsamoro Government must ensure that every child, most especially the marginalized, the disadvantaged, and those living in remote and poverty-stricken areas, must have an equal and equitable opportunity to education, regardless of their social class, race, gender, and ethnic background.

Significantly, among the Bangsamoro Children are also Persons with Disabilities (PWDs). Today, children PWDs are deprived of services due to their unique needs which are not currently specifically tended to by the government. As the Bangsamoro government has an obligation to protect the rights of the youth, it is imperative that the government cater to the children with special needs (CSN) and their education. This means that every child, regardless of his/her status or condition, must be able to go to school. The government must exert more effort to provide them with an equal opportunity to become active members of society and participate in nation-building.

Even though there are already established centers in the region that cater to the needs of these children, these facilities are noticeably absent in most of the municipalities in the region. In view of the increasing demand of the CSNs for a complete, adequate, and integrated system of education, it is imperative to create and establish at least one special needs education (SPED) center in every municipality/city in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

It is stated in Section 3, Article V of the BOL that the Bangsamoro Government shall "*exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for the efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the promotion of health and safety*". In pursuit of the Bangsamoro government’s primordial duty as the region’s parens patriae, or the guardian of the rights of the people, it is necessary to prioritize and act on the needs of the students.

With this bill highlighting the needs of the CSNs, the provision of a better access to quality education that caters to their needs becomes imperative, where the establishment of a special education center in every municipality that caters to CSNs can provide easier and better access to education to these children.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
