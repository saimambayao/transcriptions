**AN ACT PROTECTING THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT LAND OWNERSHIP OVER SITES ACTUALLY OCCUPIED BY PUBLIC SCHOOLS WITHIN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION, MANDATING THE SUMMARY TITLING OF REGISTERED AND UNREGISTERED REAL PROPERTIES USED AS PUBLICSCHOOL SITES, PROVIDING FUNDS THEREOF AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Cognizant of the predicaments experienced nowadays by some public schools in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region relative to land disputes over school sites, it is imperative that the Bangsamoro Government should institutionalize the acquisition and titling of the Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education school sites to ensure the continuous operation and maintenance of the schools. These cases include the sudden claim by private persons (the donor or their heirs) of these school sites. They deny donating the same to the school and want to immediately possess the land. While asserting ownership over the school site, they forcibly occupy the same. As a result, schools are being padlocked by these claimants and classes are disrupted for an indefinite period to the prejudice of the students. Worse, violence becomes part of the school setting and students become affected in some way. Thus, the drafting of this bill.

The bill seeks to address the issue that if MBHTE's ownership rights are not clarified, school sites may be exposed to encroachment and competing claims of ownership. It also aims to mandate that anyone claiming ownership of land where a public school is located submit the documentation needed by the Registry of Deeds, including an original copy of the deed or a certified true copy of the deed, a copy of the owner's duplicate title and the BIR clearance, which is granted following the payment of taxes.

To date, majority of our public school sites are untitled or unregistered. Some were donated for use as school sites but are now owned or titled by the Local Government Units. Some are subject to long-term lease agreement with private individuals. There are also parcels of lands which were donated for educational purposes but lack proper legal documentation to support any effort by MBHTE to support title or ownership. The lack of titles or the problem of ownership by the MBHTE on existing school sites prevent not only the full implementation of school building programs but also discourage private individuals from donating classroom and other school facilities.

The passage of this bill will pave the way for the summary titling of all lands that are being used as public school sites throughout the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. The salient feature of this bill is the proposal to declare the Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education as the prima facie owner of all unregistered school sites.

If enacted into law, the school authorities will finally have direct control and supervision over the land occupied by the public schools. The comprehensive development and improvement of the public school system will finally be realized.

Attached is the proposed bill as an immediate legislative measure.
