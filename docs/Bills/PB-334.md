**AN ACT DECLARING THE FIRST SEVEN DAYS OF SHAWWAL AS "MENTAL WELLNESS AND FAMILY WEEK" IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM), PROVIDING APPROPRIATIONS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Mental health and family well-being are critical components of a flourishing society. In Islam, maintaining mental and familial health is highly emphasized as they form the foundation of strong communities and resilient individuals. Following the holy month of Ramadan, the first seven days of Shawwal provide an ideal period for rejuvenation of both the mind and family dynamics after the physical and emotional demands of fasting.

Eid al-Fitr, celebrated on the first day of Shawwal, is a time of joy, thanksgiving, and community. The succeeding days offer a perfect opportunity to focus on long-term mental and familial well-being, which is vital for both personal and communal growth.

October 10 is recognized globally as World Mental Health Day, and in the Philippines, the month of October is celebrated as National Mental Health Month, with the second week designated as National Mental Health Week. However, it is essential to recognize the unique cultural and religious context of BARMM, and to develop programs that emphasize mental health and family dynamics from an Islamic perspective.

This bill seeks to declare the first seven days of Shawwal as "Mental Wellness and Family Week" in BARMM, providing every ministry and office the discretion to celebrate in ways that highlight the importance of mental health and family from an Islamic viewpoint, with a focus on work-life balance and long-term well-being.
