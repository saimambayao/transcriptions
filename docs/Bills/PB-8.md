**AN ACT**
**CREATING THE BANGSAMORO IRRIGATION COORDINATING OFFICE, DEFINING ITS POWERS AND FUNCTIONS, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREOF, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**Explanatory Note**

Section 2, Article V of the Organic Law provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise its authority over matters including agriculture, food security, inland waters, public works, and infrastructure water supply and services, flood control and irrigation systems, among others.

In close collaboration with the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) which takes the lead in the development of irrigation projects and facilities in the country under R.A. 3601, the Bangsamoro Government shall fully harness its irrigation potentials to increase production and productivity of the region's agricultural resources.

The current state of irrigation development in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is indicated by these statistics. In 2018, the potential irrigable areas in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) were about 160,150 hectares, while the area served was only about 50,096 hectares or the equivalent of a development rate of 31.28 percent of the region's irrigable areas.¹

This implies that the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region still has vast irrigation potentials which, if properly developed, will address food security and rice sufficiency in the region.

Presently, the National Irrigation Administration does not have a regional office in BARMM. The autonomous region is presently served by NIA's provincial offices in the provinces. Maguindanao is served by NIA Region XII, through its provincial office in Maguindanao. Lanao del Sur is served by NIA Region X, while the Island provinces of Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, and Basilan are served by the NIA Regional Office IX.

With the establishment of the irrigation coordinating office in the BARMM, the Bangsamoro Government will be able to address the irrigation gaps and it would be able to work directly on irrigation system development in the autonomous region.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
