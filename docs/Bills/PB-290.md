**ESTABLISHING A REGIONAL DIAGNOSTIC AND CLINICAL LABORATORY IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM), APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES¹**

**Explanatory Note**

Under the 1987 Constitution, “*the State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them.*” (Section 5, Article II).

Furthermore, Section 11, Article XIII of the Constitution provides that the State shall adopt an integrated and comprehensive approach to health development which shall endeavor to make essential goods, health and other social services available to all the people at affordable cost. There shall be priority for the needs of the underprivileged sick, elderly, disabled, women, and children. The State shall endeavor to provide free medical care to paupers.

In the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, Section 3, Article V of Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), provides that as part of the general welfare of the people, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure, support, and promote the health and safety of its people.

Furthermore, Section 22, Article IX of the BOL provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall adopt a policy on health that provides for a comprehensive and integrated health service delivery for its constituents. It shall establish by law a general hospital system to serve the health requirements of its people and ensure that the individual basic right to life shall be attainable through the prompt intervention of excellent and affordable medical services.

This section also extends that the Bangsamoro Government shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. It shall also uphold the peoples' right to have access to essential goods, health, and other social services that promote their well-being. The Parliament shall enact appropriate legislation towards this end, including the regulation of the manufacture and distribution of food, drinks, drugs, and tobacco in accordance with the policies, rules and regulations of concerned national government agencies. The Bangsamoro Government shall assist and cooperate with the National Government in the provision of quarantine services for the prevention and control of epidemic and other communicable diseases.

Health is a fundamental right of every Bangsamoro. The right to health should mean that everyone should have equal access to the health services they need, when and where they need them, without suffering financial hardship. To make this right to health a reality, every Bangsamoro must have access to quality services. Not only for an individual Bangsamoro, but also including the health of their respective families and the community of their domicile. Ideally, no Bangsamoro should be hindered by and deprived of health services due to circumstances such as lack of access, and financial inability.

The early detection of any kind of disease frequently leads to better treatment outcomes, as most diseases are more responsive to treatment when detected earlier. Significantly, early detection can also prevent the disease from progressing to worse circumstances. Through measures such as screening and testing, early detection is often recommended. However, better chances of early detection correlates to the availability and capacity of nearest health service centers. Thus, an advance establishment of a clinical laboratory is a must in the Bangsamoro region.

Clinical laboratories are facilities that is involved in the pre-analytical, analytical, and post-analytical procedures, where tests are done on specimens from the human body to obtain information about the health status of a patient for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases. These tests include, but are not limited to the following disciplines: anatomic pathology, clinical chemistry, clinical microscopy, endocrinology, hematology, immunology and serology, microbiology, toxicology, as well as molecular and nuclear diagnostics.

The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region has six (6) provinces namely, Maguindanao del Norte, Maguindanao del Sur, Lanao del Sur, Basilan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi and three (3) cities namely, Cotabato City, Lamitan City and Marawi City. As of today, a number of the special tests ordered by the attending physicians of the patients living in the BARMM are not available within the region. Most of the time, they refer the patient’s specimen to the Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City, or in some cases, the Philippine General Hospital in Manila.

Essentially, the establishment of a Regional Diagnostic and Clinical Laboratory with complete special tests manned by highly competitive and well-trained personnel can lessen the burden of the Bangsamoro people, as such facilities can enable their attending physicians to diagnose their health condition capably, and on time.

This bill aims to ensure that the Bangsamoro Government prioritize the welfare of the Bangsamoro people such as accessing the basic, quality and affordable medical services.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
