**AN ACT ESTABLISHING A CHILDREN’S PLAYGROUND IN EVERY SCHOOL, DEFINING ITS SCOPE AND COVERAGE, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREOF, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**Explanatory Note**

The 1987 Constitution recognizes the importance of the youth and their welfare. Enshrined under the state policies of the Constitution, specifically under Article II, Section 13, is the recognition by the State of the important role of the youth in nation-building. Because of this, the State declares its policy to promote their physical and social well-being, among others.

This is reiterated in Section 13, Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), which states that “[t]he Bangsamoro Government shall recognize the vital role of the youth in nation-building, promote and protect their physical, moral, spiritual, and nationalism, encourage involvement in public and civic affairs, and promote mental and physical fitness through sports.”

Play helps in the development of the child by stimulating the child’s brain which will eventually help them learn to communicate and deal with emotions. Play is essential for child development around the world, so much so that the United Nations recognizes it as a right of every child. Specifically, the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), adopted by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on November 20, 1989, states under its Article 31 that every child has the right to rest and leisure, to play and freely participate in cultural life and the arts.

In an article about the benefits of play, according to Marie Hartwell-Walker, Ed.D who is an author and a licensed psychologist, after a baby is born, 75 percent of the brain develops in the years between birth and his or her early twenties and play is needed for healthy brain development. Play stimulates the brain connections between nerve cells, helping a child develop both gross motor skills like walking, running, jumping, and coordination along with fine motor skills like writing, manipulating small tools, and detailed hand work. Play during the teen years and into adulthood helps the brain develop even more connectivity especially in the frontal lobe, which is the center for planning and making good decisions. Playgrounds are also essential in Filipino communities and a cornerstone of childhood development. The children should have a space to play no matter where they are.

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends children and adolescents ages six (6) through 17 should have at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity every day, and the playground is the perfect place to get this done.

According to Little Tikes Commercial, a known playground equipment provider, the establishment of a playground inside the school has the following important benefits for the children:

a) *learning through play* – the playground is the best place for children to engage in free play which can enhance their imaginative skills. Free play can also give them the freedom to choose how they play which can eventually help them to think independently and develop their decision-making skills;

b) *physical development* – a healthy body is equivalent to a healthy mind. Playgrounds are an essential aspect in the development of a healthy body since it is a place where the children can get a full-body workout that can strengthen their arms, legs, torso, and other body parts;

c) *social development* – one way of teaching the children how to interact with others and other social norms is by letting them engage in cooperative and collaborative play. This will come in handy when they reach adulthood and can be applied in their future workplace;

d) *emotional development* – playtime outside the four corners of the room provides an opportunity for the children to deal with their emotions and reduce stress levels. It can also serve as a distraction from their problems since happiness is a natural byproduct of outdoor activities;

e) *promotion of the use of imagination* – playgrounds can help kids promote their imaginative skills since imaginary play is a given whenever children are on the playground. This can enhance their creativity and can foster their ability to do things on its own which can help them develop their own personality;

f) *makes education more fun* – children will be more interested to go to school since playgrounds offer children an opportunity to let loose.

Reduction in free play can negatively impact the development of children. The amount of time the kids spend playing outside has decreased in the past few decades especially nowadays as kids would much rather spend numerous hours consuming media and playing games through smartphones, computers, and televisions, rather than playing physical games.

It is stated in Section 3, Article V of the BOL that “[t]he Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the promotion of health and safety.”

The playground is a safe place that is essential for children to be themselves while developing crucial cognitive, physical, social, emotional, and imaginative skills that are necessary in order to gain self-confidence and advance critical thinking capabilities. Unstructured free play can help children learn skills that they will need one day as adults.

Now that the world is slowly transitioning to more face-to-face activities, one of these being everyday classes, children will now be spending a significant amount of their days in school again. Thus, during these formative years of their lives, the schools once again will become the children’s second home and will thus have a crucial role in imparting to students the importance of physical self-care, which includes getting adequate outdoor physical activity. A healthy body is equivalent to a healthy mind.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
