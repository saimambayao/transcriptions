**AN ACT CREATING THE BANGSAMORO COUNCIL FOR MENTAL HEALTH, PROVIDING FOR ITS MANDATE, POWERS, AND FUNCTIONS, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Mental Health Act was approved on June 20, 2018. Section 2 of RA 11036 declared that it was the policy of the state to affirm the basic right of all Filipinos to mental health as well as the fundamental rights of people who require mental health services.

Further, Section 3 of the said law listed the following as the objectives:

a) Strengthen effective leadership and governance for mental health by, among others, formulating, developing, and implementing national policies, strategies, programs, and regulations relating to mental health;
b) Develop and establish a comprehensive, integrated effective and efficient national mental health care system responsive to the psychiatric, neurologic, and psychosocial needs of the Filipino people;
c) Protect the rights and freedoms of persons with psychiatric, neurologic, and psychosocial needs;
d) Strengthen information systems, evidence and research for mental health;
e) Integrated mental health care in the basic health services; and
f) Integrate strategies promoting mental health in educational institutions, the workplace, and in communities.

However, in the three years since its enactment, the Philippines has yet to improve its mental health stats. When the National Center for Mental Health launched its suicide hotline in 2019, they received an average of 400 calls monthly. When lockdown was first implemented in 2020, the number ballooned to 700 calls. It peaked at 1,600 calls earlier this year. A third of the calls were suicide-related, while the rest were anxieties about the pandemic, unemployment, and other personal problems. Some callers reported waiting for at least an hour before a health worker could attend to them.

In 2020, suicides increased by 57%, with the Philippine Statistics Authority reporting 4,420 self-harm cases. Suicide has also gone up the list of leading causes of death in the Philippines, now 25th from the previous 31st in 2019. One in 10 Filipino young adults have now experienced a form of depression.

In a piece published by the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism, Filipinos with mental health illnesses shared how lockdown, unemployment and economic losses affected their ability to deal with their illnesses, such as higher costs for therapy sessions and difficulty to purchase their monthly medication.

For example, a one-hour session with a private clinical psychologist can cost somewhere from P1,000 to P3,000, which, for Filipino families living under the poverty line, is better spent on a sack of rice and other essential goods. With the country experiencing the worst decline in Asia, an estimated 4.5 million Filipinos are expected to slide back into poverty. Another saddening fact is that even with the availability of pro-bono tele-psychotherapy services online (which are nowhere near sufficient to service the 110 million population), Filipinos would rather suffer in silence than face the societal stigma against those with mental health issues.

Earlier this year, DOH reported that at least 3.6 million Filipinos were battling mental health issues. 1.4 million Filipinos had depression, 847,000 were battling alcohol-use disorders, while 520,000 were diagnosed with bipolar disorder, according to Frances Prescilla Cuevas, chief health program officer of the DOH’s Disease Prevention and Control Bureau. More alarmingly, the department reported that 1 in 3 Covid-19 patients were diagnosed with neuropsychiatric conditions 6 months after contracting the virus.

According to the DOH website, the total Covid-19 cases in the Bangsamoro number at 17,774, which would mean roughly 5,925 Bangsamoro people with neuropsychiatric conditions. Due to the underreporting of Covid-19 cases, this only meant that the actual number of Filipinos with mental health issues would have to be higher.

Within the Bangsamoro region, people have had to contend with the consequences of calamities and conflict, aside from the repercussions of the pandemic. In fact, a youth survey in 2017 marked that of its ARMM participants, 10.9% had suicidal thoughts, and suicidal rates have only increased among the youth since then. International health organization Médecins Sans Frontières published a report on the lack of mental health interventions during and post-conflict in the Philippines, particularly in Maguindanao, but this scenario is common across the entire region. During the height of the Marawi siege in 2017, data from the Integrated Provincial Health Office in Lanao del Sur showed that 30,732 evacuees manifested mental health disorders. Research also shows that sexual and gender-based violence were prone to take place during and post-conflict. An assessment on the Marawi IDPs corroborated this when it showed that 45% of conflict-affected sites reported that girls were the most affected by sexual violence. The conflict monitoring system of International Alert recorded a total of 2,655 violent conflict incidents in BARMM, which had a decrease of 9% from the previous year, however, clan feuding incidents increased by 50% with the highest recorded incidents in Lanao del Sur and Maguindanao, including Cotabato City.

Recommendations for the improvement of the state of mental health in the country included the mobilization of mental health professionals to educate families about mental health and mental disorders to fight stigma and discrimination; earlier intervention, prevention, and response strategies with special attention to the mental health issues of the youth; conduct of medical and scientific research to be used as basis for the improvement of a comprehensive and effective mental health care system; and identification of gaps in the implementation of the Mental Health Act.

The combined effects of continuing conflict, calamities, and Covid-19, requires the special attention of the Bangsamoro Government. Mental health, instead of being seen as a existing problem and an additional burden to the state's resources, should instead be understood as an important component of public health, having a significant effects on a government's human, social, and economic capital. In short, responding to and addressing the Bangsamoro people's mental health should be part of the government's economic recovery plan, because happiness is a factor to a person’s functionality and participation in society.

At the national government, Kabataan Party-list Rep. Sarah Elago criticized the DOH for only allocating ₱615.5 million for the provision of drugs for mental illnesses, which would only translate to ₱5.69 per Filipino. The Bangsamoro Government, on the other hand, allocated ₱12,770,340.00 for its Mental Health Program in the 2021 budget (BAA 13).

The Philippine Council for Mental Health, which is composed of the Secretary of DOH as Chairperson, Secretary of DepED, Secretary of DOLE, Chairperson of CHR, Secretary of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), Chairperson of CHED, and other sectoral representatives, is responsible for implementing the provisions of the Mental Health Act, coordinating the activities and strengthening the working relations among national government agencies, and drafting the country’s strategic plan on mental health, among others.

As an autonomous government, it is thus proper for the Bangsamoro region to establish its own Bangsamoro Council for Mental Health, which will be responsible for recommending programs, projects, and policies for the mental health and well-being of the Bangsamoro people. As the region’s inter-agency body on mental health, they will be better capacitated to implement the recommendations mentioned earlier.

In view of the foregoing, the support of all the Members of the Parliament for the prompt passage of this measure is earnestly sought.
