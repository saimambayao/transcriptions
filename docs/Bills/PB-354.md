**AN ACT ESTABLISHING A BANGSAMORO CENTER FOR CHILDREN DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD) IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES$^1$**

**Explanatory Note**

Article 2, Section 15 of the 1987 Constitution provides that the State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them.

Moreover, Section 11, Article XIII of the Constitution on Social Justice and Human Rights provides that the State shall adopt an integrated and comprehensive approach to health development which shall endeavor to make essential goods, health and other social services available to all the people at affordable cost. There shall be priority for the needs of the underprivileged sick, elderly, disabled, women, and children. The State shall endeavor to provide free medical care to paupers.

In the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, Section 3, Article V of Republic Act No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) provides that as part of the general welfare of the people, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure, support, and promote the health and safety of its people.

Furthermore, Section 2, Article IX of the BOL states that the Bangsamoro Government shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. It shall also uphold the people’s right to have access to essential goods health, and other social services that promote their well-being.

According to the National Institute of Mental Health$^2$, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder that affects how people interact with others, communicate, learn, and behave. Although autism can be diagnosed at any age, it is described as a “developmental disorder” because symptoms generally appear in the first 2 years of life. According to the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders* (DSM-5), a guide created by the American Psychiatric Association that health care providers use to diagnose mental disorders, people with ASD often have:

(a) Difficulty with communication and interaction with other people;
(b) Restricted interests and repetitive behaviors; and
(c) Symptoms that affect their ability to function in school, work, and other areas of life.

Moreover, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) comprises a diverse group of conditions characterized by varying degrees of difficulty in social interaction and communication. Other common traits include atypical patterns of behavior and activity, such as difficulty transitioning from one activity to another, a heightened focus on details, and unusual responses to sensory stimuli. The abilities and needs of individuals with autism vary and may change over time. While some individuals with ASD can live independently, others may have severe disabilities and require lifelong care and support. Autism often affects educational attainment and employment opportunities. Additionally, the demands on families providing care and support can be considerable. Societal attitudes and the level of support offered by local and national authorities significantly influence the quality of life of individuals with autism$^3$.

The World Health Organization (WHO) further stated that, globally, it is estimated that approximately 1 in 100 children has autism. This estimate represents an average figure, and reported prevalence rates vary significantly across studies$^4$.

According to data from the Department of Health (DOH), there were approximately 500,000 recorded cases of autism in 2008. A decade later, that number doubled, reaching an estimated one million cases$^5$.

Numerous medical and psychological studies have found that with intensive and sustained special education programs and behavioral therapy initiated early in life, individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can acquire self-care, social, and vocational skills, resulting in improved functioning and a decrease in the severity of symptoms and maladaptive behaviors. Sustainable development for individuals with ASD can only be achieved if their needs are adequately addressed.

Although there is currently no cure for ASD, several interventions can help children with the condition, including special education, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. Speech therapy primarily focuses on communication skills, while occupational therapy teaches individuals basic daily living skills, as well as behavior management and rehabilitation techniques. Depending on the type of session, the typical cost per hour ranges from ₱500 to ₱1,500.

These essential services often come at a significant cost—one that is far beyond the reach of marginalized families. As a result, parents of children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) who lack the financial capacity to support their care are left with limited, if any, options.

Through this proposed measure, a Bangsamoro Center for Children Diagnosed with ASD shall be established in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region to empower children with special needs and their families. The Center shall offer free evaluations, physical and occupational therapy, and socialization programs. It shall also provide educational assistance, training for parents, and community awareness initiatives to improve the quality of life of children with ASD and foster inclusive development.

The establishment of the Bangsamoro ASD Center will enable children with autism to live more freely and independently, and to pursue a meaningful, productive, and fulfilling life.

The Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA), as the interim government of the Bangsamoro region, is mandated to promote the overall well-being of every Bangsamoro, especially those on the autism spectrum.

In view of the foregoing, the immediate passage and approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
