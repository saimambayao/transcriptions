**AN ACT ESTABLISHING THE BANGSAMORO ENTERPRISE SUPPORT CORPORATION (BESC)**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) form the backbone of the Philippine economy. Nationwide, they account for 99.59% of all business establishments, employing over 62.4% of the country’s workforce, and contributing 36% to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).¹ In the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), MSMEs likewise play a vital role in local livelihood, particularly in agriculture, trade, crafts, and halal-related industries. However, their potential remains largely untapped due to persistent structural challenges such as limited access to finance, market linkages, infrastructure, and business development services. This is all further compounded by a history of conflict, geographic isolation, and deep-rooted poverty.

Despite various national efforts to strengthen MSMEs including programs under the Small Business Corporation (SB Corp.), the financing arm of the Department of Trade and Industry, Bangsamoro-based enterprises continue to face difficulty accessing capital, particularly Shari’ah-compliant financial services that align with the Islamic values of the majority population in the region. As of 2024, the Philippine Statistics Authority noted that BARMM had the lowest number of registered enterprises per capita compared to all other regions.²

It is within this context that this proposed measure seeks to create the Bangsamoro Enterprise Support Corporation (BESC). The corporation will be a regional counterpart of the SB Corporation but with a mandate tailored to the unique cultural, religious, and socio-economic context of BARMM. The Corporation shall function as a government-owned and controlled corporation (GOCC) of the Bangsamoro Government and under the policy and administrative supervision of the Ministry of Trade, Investments, and Tourism (MTIT).

The primary objectives of the BESC shall include, but not be limited to:

a) Designing and offering Shari’ah-compliant financing and loan products such as Murabaha, Ijara, Mudarabah, Qard Hasan, and Tawarruq;

b) Providing capacity development, technical assistance, and entrepreneurial education to MSMEs, particularly in marginalized and post-conflict communities;

c) Facilitating market access, digitization, and halal certification to enable competitiveness in local and international markets;

d) Coordinating with national and regional agencies, development partners, and Islamic finance institutions to expand support systems for MSMEs in BARMM;

e) Supporting women entrepreneurs, youth-led enterprises, and cooperatives through targeted financing and mentorship programs;

f) Promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth, peacebuilding, and self-reliance among the Bangsamoro people.

More than an economic initiative, the creation of the Bangsamoro Enterprise Support Corporation is an intervention to preserve the peace and development in the region. A strong and inclusive MSME sector generates employment and offers a pathway out of poverty for thousands of Bangsamoro families. In a region still healing from conflict and displacement, empowering small businesses is also empowering communities.

Through this legislative measure, it is sought to institutionalize a shariah-compliant financing corporation that reflects the distinct economic and cultural context of the region.
