**A BILL INSTITUTIONALIZING SINGLE WINDOW TRANSACTION (SWiT) MODIFIED BUSINESS ONE-STOP SHOP IN ALL LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNITS WITHIN THE BANGSAMORO REGION**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

*Taxes are the lifeblood of the government.*

This doctrine cannot be truer in the case of the Bangsamoro Region whose block grant is to cease in a few years' time. Hence, it is deemed a priority to encourage investments and improve the existing sources of income in the region. One of the primary sources of the local government units' income, which will eventually endow to the benefit of the Bangsamoro region, is the collection on business permits and licenses. However, there are various micro-scale and small-scale businesses within the Bangsamoro region that are unregistered. These are loss of income and opportunity for the LGUs and of the Bangsamoro region.

The Bangsamoro government understands that one of the reasons why they are unregistered is the tedious process of acquiring one. This costs business owners time and resources. Hence, to encourage the registration of businesses and to enable the Bangsamoro government to regulate them, this bill is being proposed to simplify and streamline the registration process of business establishments. This is not only intended for unregistered businesses but to also encourage business investments in the region.

The proposed Single Window Transaction - Modified Business One-Stop Shop (SWiT-M-BOSS) is a laudable innovation of the City of Muntinlupa and other cities. The new simplified process encouraged more registrants and more investments in their city due to the ease of conducting business. Under the old process, there are various offices involved such as BPLO, Zoning, City Building, City Health, Fire Department, PESO, Treasury, Mayor's Office, and others. In this proposed bill, the business owner or its representative will only deal with one person who shall receive all necessary documents, generates the assessment to be paid, and issue the receipt and the approved permit.

This proposal seeks to adopt the best practices of other jurisdictions which may also bring forth good in the Bangsamoro region as much as it brought good for them. Hence, its passage is sought.
