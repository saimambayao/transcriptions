**AN ACT**
**CREATING THE BANGSAMORO PRINTING OFFICE, DEFINING ITS POWERS, FUNCTIONS, AND RESPONSIBILITIES, PROVIDING FUNDS THEREOF, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**Explanatory Note**

Section 5, Article VII of R.A. No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law states that “[t]he Bangsamoro Parliament shall have the power to enact laws to promote, protect, and ensure the general welfare of the Bangsamoro people and other inhabitants in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.” Among the many functions of the Bangsamoro Government is the promotion of economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the delivery of public services. With this, it is necessary to establish an effective government printing and publication system that will cater the printing needs of the Bangsamoro Government to fully serve its people.

The Bangsamoro Government produces a heavy volume of forms, files, and requirements on a daily basis. Hundreds, if not thousands, of documents are printed each day. Given this, a lot of expenses are allocated to the printing of these files and documents.

The proposed Bangsamoro Printing Office (BPO) is tasked with the printing of accountable forms and the high quality and volume of requirements of the Bangsamoro Government's ministries, offices, and instrumentalities. Beside the forms and materials listed in this Bill, the BPO may also accept other Bangsamoro Government printing jobs, including government publications. Direct printing by the BPO will save funds of the Bangsamoro Government, as the necessary materials and printing will be procured and done by the office itself, thus saving the Bangsamoro Government from extra costs.

The BPO shall be under the Office of the Chief Minister (OCM) and will serve as the Bangsamoro Government’s printing arm that will be able to provide all of the printing needs of the Bangsamoro Government.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
