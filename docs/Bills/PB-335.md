**Explanatory Notes**

Bangsamoro struggle is a crucial part and plays a vital role in shaping the contemporary history of the Bangsamoro as a nation and as a political entity. Marking the places and sites where the struggle took place, conceived, shaped or architect and sustained by our leaders who sacrificed their lives and freedom to live normally in the society helps us to understand the journey they made during those trying times.

The house of the Ameerul Mujahideen Sheikh Salamat Hashim and the Islamic Center where he used to maintain and operate his abode and command post, respectively, deserves recognition to inspire the Bangsamoro people especially the next generation. These are the places where the Ammer's ideal for the Bangsamoro nation was conceptualized, formed, and came into fruition, and it is only but just that it must be given the due respect and honor it rightfully deserves.

The honor and recognition given to these historic sites and considering the same as historic landmark and heritage will help us examine the history of the struggle and enable us and the next generation to develop awareness of what really transpired in the history. It will help us understand the keystone of our heritage that plays the important role in our politics, society and world view.

We are sponsoring this bill seeking to declare the house of Sheikh Salamat Hashim in Camp Abubakar and the Islamic Center in Pagalungan, Maguindanao del Sur as a historical place and providing for its restoration, renovation and upkeep befitting our great leader's status and in recognition of his struggles which paved the way for our present governance and existence.
