**AN ACT PROVIDING FOR THE CREATION OF PARLIAMENTARY DISTRICTS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Bangsamoro Organic Law (Republic Act No. 11054) mandates that the Bangsamoro Parliament shall be composed of eighty (80) Members, including representatives elected from single-member parliamentary districts apportioned within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). Section 10, Article VII of the said law further provides that the Parliament shall have the power to reconstitute by law the parliamentary districts apportioned among the provinces, cities, municipalities, and geographical areas of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region to ensure equitable representation in Parliament. The redistricting, merging, or creation of parliamentary districts shall be based on the number of inhabitants and additional provinces, cities, municipalities, and geographical areas, which shall become part of the Bangsamoro territorial jurisdiction.

In compliance with this constitutional and organic requirement, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament enacted Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 58, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Parliamentary Districting Act of 2024, which created thirty-two (32) single-member parliamentary districts in the BARMM. This Act sought to ensure equitable representation of the inhabitants of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in the Bangsamoro Parliament, in accordance with the principles of contiguity, compactness, and population equality.

Subsequently, the Parliament enacted Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 77, or the Bangsamoro Electoral Code of 2023, which laid down the framework for the conduct of elections for Members of the Bangsamoro Parliament. The passage of BAA 77 effectively superseded BAA 58, particularly following the Supreme Court’s ruling in *Province of Sulu v. Medialdea*, G.R. No. 242255, promulgated on September 9, 2024, which resulted in the exclusion of the Province of Sulu from the territorial coverage of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. The said decision rendered the districting established under BAA 58 no longer fully consistent with the constitutional and territorial parameters of the Region.

Thereafter, in the case of *Lanang T. Ali v. Commission on Elections*, E-02219 / E-02235, promulgated on September 30, 2025, the Supreme Court declared Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 77 unconstitutional, and directed the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament to immediately undertake and accomplish, not later than October 30, 2025, the determination of parliamentary districts for the first regular elections of the Members of the Bangsamoro Parliament.

In view of these rulings, the Bangsamoro Parliament is now duty-bound to enact a new, constitutionally compliant districting law that will define the composition and boundaries of the parliamentary districts within the BARMM, consistent with the provisions of the Bangsamoro Organic Law and the guidance of the Supreme Court.

This proposed measure, therefore, seeks to:

1. Ensure equitable representation of the inhabitants of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

2. Align the apportionment of parliamentary districts with the most recent demographic and geographic data, while upholding the principles of contiguity, compactness, and adjacency;

3. Implement the directives of the Supreme Court in the case of *Province of Sulu v. Medialdea* and *Lanang T. Ali v. COMELEC*; and

4. Guarantee readiness for the first regular parliamentary elections in accordance with the 1987 Philippine Constitution.

In light of the constitutional mandate and the explicit directive of the Supreme Court, the immediate passage of this measure is imperative to uphold the rule of law, ensure fair and effective representation, and preserve the integrity of the forthcoming parliamentary elections in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

Approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
