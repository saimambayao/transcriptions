**A BILL PROVIDING FOR THE CULTURAL SENSITIVITY ETIQUETTE TO AND FOR MUSLIMS IN BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The creation of BARMM also entails its re-introduction to the rest of the Philippines and of the world. And, there is no other way to rebrand it but to showcase our unique culture and the concept of halal.

To promote our cultural identity and the concept of halal, it is important to draw the line what our culture is and what halal is in the perspective of our culture and religion. Thus, it is necessary that we make people aware of our customs, traditions, and most importantly, the etiquette in dealing with us Muslims who have distinct identity. This effort is only a way of promoting the halal industry and promoting our uniqueness to from the rest. Cultural sensitivity is a crucial aspect of building harmonious communities and the way to foster that is through knowledge. Hence, this bill seeks to bringforth such knowledge.

The intention of this bill is not to contravene the constitutional proscription on the separation of the church and the state but to even promote the constitutional right of the Bangsamoro people to practice their religion and to be respected therewith. For anyone who will visit the BARMM, may as a tourist, an investor, a social worker, or a migrant, it is important to know the do’s and don’t’s when dealing with the people of the region. This bill seeks to foster the understanding and respect for those who do not know.

Above all, this bill also serves as a reinforcement to the residents of BARMM and the general advocacy of Moral Governance. The Bangsamoro government still owes its existence to its long-fought principle and the desire to preserve its own identity. This bill only looks back to that aspiration.
