**ESTABLISHING A LEVEL-1 GENERAL HOSPITAL IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF LANTAWAN, PROVINCE OF BASILAN, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government is mandated by law to ensure and support, among other things, the promotion of the health and safety of its constituents. As provided in Article IX, Section 22 of Republic Act No. 11054, or the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao:

“The Bangsamoro Government shall adopt a policy of health that provides for a comprehensive and integrated health service delivery for its constituents. It shall establish by law a general hospital system to serve the health requirements of its people and ensure that the individual’s basic right to life shall be attainable through the prompt intervention of excellent and affordable medical services.”

Lantawan is a coastal and a third-class municipality in the island province of Basilan, created and politically subdivided into 25 barangays. According to the Population Census of 2020, it has a total population of 31,040 which represents 7.28% of the total population of Basilan Province across an area of 405.048241 square kilometers, which constitutes 11.73% of Basilan’s total area.

There is only the Matarling Rural Health Unit in Lantawan that provides basic health services to the entire municipality, and it is primarily a maternity clinic. For emergency and other health services, the patients need to be transported to the nearest hospital, or the nearest health center in neighboring municipalities. This inconveniences Lantawan’s constituents and, in some cases, the cost paid is in the lives of patients who expire without receiving the urgent medical care they need.

Under these conditions, the State is bound by law to support the highest attainable standard of health to uphold the fundamental right of every human being, as is the state’s obligation.

Hence, to give substance and spirit to the provision of the Bangsamoro Organic Law, there is an urgent need for the construction and establishment of the Lantawan General Hospital, a measure that provides the municipality’s constituents’ societal rights, and ensure that their individual basic rights to life are upheld.

The current principle that has been recently adopted in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Universal Health Coverage is a rights-based approach that requires health policy and programs to prioritize the needs of those furthest behind the first.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
