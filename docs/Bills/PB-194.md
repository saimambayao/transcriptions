**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

It is no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected not just public health but all aspects of society. Economies all over the globe have been hard-hit by the pandemic, leaving millions jobless and seeking new forms of livelihood. The Philippines has not been spared of these adverse effects, as the informal workers have been at the forefront of this crisis.

Informal workers consist of daily wage earners such as public transport drivers, vendors, and small and medium enterprises both in the retail and service sectors. In 2008, there were about 10.5 million informal sector operators (IS operators) identified in the Informal Sector Survey (2008 ISS) of the Philippines conducted by the National Statistics Office. The 10.5 million IS operators is broken down into the following: 41.3% were engaged in agriculture, hunting, and forestry, IS operators in wholesale and retail trade accounted for more than one-fourth (29.6%) of the total IS operators while those in transport, storage and communications, about 10%. Moreover, data from the Labor Force Survey, indicated that 38.3% of those employed are in vulnerable forms of employment. This means that, nearly 2 out of 5 workers are less likely to have formal work arrangements and access to social protection and are more at risk during a crisis or shock. As informal workers generally operate outside the bounds of government oversight, the lack of statistics or data makes them vulnerable to exploitation and abuses.

Within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, the health crisis only worsened the pre-existing inequalities and poverty incidences in the region, which mainly operates as an agricultural economy with a large informal sector (low income and tax collections). Unemployment shot up to 29.8% due to the pandemic, the highest in the country. Although there have been programs put in place to mitigate the economic crisis, these are insufficient to bridge the gap.

The UNDP’s Socioeconomic Impact Assessment of Covid-19 in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao Report highlighted some of the following key concerns: mobility restrictions continue to affect work and businesses that resulted in income declines, work stoppages, reduced working hours, and unemployment, heavily affecting the informal economy sector; and women and children are more likely to bear the brunt of the social and economic consequences of the pandemic (income affected as informal workers, education affected as lockdowns enforce school closure or distance learning).

Among the report’s policy recommendations are the following: (1) **building a database on vulnerable sectors to enhance policy effectiveness**, (2) assessing current social protection programs in BARMM to enhance efficiency, effectiveness, and transitioning to universal social protection, (3) exploring opportunities to diversify and broaden sources of economic growth, (4) creating a stimulus package for the informal sector to start/restart their business and livelihood, (4) and undertaking research on women as they form the majority of informal economy sector.

With huge number of informal workers losing their incomes during lockdown and acknowledging their impact to the economy, it is imperative to provide protection in extending assistance through formulation of meaningful policies, programs, activities and other possible interventions. However, the government remains “statistically blind” to the exact figures of the informal workers in the country and even the national government also made the same call to this effect.

Through this measure, taking cognizance of the various forms of crises, natural or human-made, setting-up a database of informal workers is imperative which would address the issue on the quality of employment of these informal workers, and to assist the local government units (LGUs) to have a standardized identification of recipients for relief assistance.

As the Bangsamoro government is mandated to pass labor laws that expand or enhance the rights of workers, it is for this reason, that the immediate passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
