**AN ACT**
**ESTABLISHING AN INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISM TO ENSURE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

With the enactment of the Bangsamoro Organic Law and the creation of a new autonomous government in the Bangsamoro region stemmed a number of development opportunities to further improve the quality of life of the people within its jurisdiction.

Under the leadership of the Chief Minister and the adoption of moral governance as the Bangsamoro Government’s leading policy guideline during this transition period, development and implementation of strong policy reforms and interventions are to be expected to ensure better service delivery and an inclusive governance paradigm, especially for the marginalized and vulnerable sectors in communities across the region.

Among these are the differently abled persons or Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) who represent a substantial segment of our society. Due to long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments, they are generally considered highly vulnerable and confronted with challenges such as accessing education, healthcare, and exploring economic opportunities. Stigma, poor access to their physical environment, transportation, information, and communication, the lack of inclusive policies, support services, and social protection also count among the barriers they regularly face.

It is relevant to note that the Bangsamoro Organic Law provides for the establishment of a special agency, support facilities, and livelihood or skills training for persons with special needs, and other disadvantaged persons for their rehabilitation and productive integration into
