**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

In G.R. Nos. 271741 and 271972, Datu Sajid S. Sinsuat et al. v. Hon. Ahod Balawag Ebrahim, in his capacity as Interim Chief Minister of the Bangsamoro Government and Bangsamoro Transition Authority, the Supreme Court partially granted the petitions against Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 54 on August 20, 2024. It declared Section 5 of the said BAA unconstitutional, as it allowed only the qualified voters of the barangays comprising the new municipalities to vote in the plebiscite. The Court ruled that qualified voters from both the new and mother municipalities should be included in the plebiscite.

As such, this bill is filed to amend Section 5 of BAA No. 54, allowing qualified voters from both the new and mother municipality of Datu Sinsuat Balabaran in the province of Maguindanao del Norte to vote in the plebiscite pursuant to Article 10, Section 10 of the Constitution.
