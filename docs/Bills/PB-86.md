**AN ACT**
**CREATING THE SEAWEED INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION, AND DEFINING ITS OBJECTIVES, POWERS AND FUNCTIONS**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

For centuries, seaweed has been utilized throughout the world – in the earliest times, solely as a food source for coastal communities. Today, the global seaweed industry is worth more than USD 6 billion per annum, of which some 85% comprises food products directly or indirectly used for human consumption.¹

The industry reached USD 9.9 billion in 2018 and is projected to grow by seven percent by 2024. This growth is primarily due to the food industry, particularly nutritional supplements, which are increasingly used as substitutes for animal products like meat and fish. They are also increasingly being used in pharmaceutical products, including in the development of cancer treatments.²

The global seaweed market is experiencing steady growth, buoyed by the increasing demand for products. This trend is likely to continue due to their rising use in the food industry across the world. In terms of processing and utilizing products not directly consumed as food, seaweed is much more present than is generally recognized. Carrageenan from red seaweed is used in the thickening/gelling of food products; processing of meats, sausages and fish; clarifying alcohol; pharmaceuticals and dentistry; the health and beauty industries; soil fertilizers; textile printing; bacterial culture as a substrate; water filtration; and fishery diets.³

Seaweed likewise offers an attractive alternative to other biofuels and can become a resource for these communities. As a way to improve the lives of people in developing countries, this sector could also reduce energy dependency in regions with favorable climatic conditions: The favorable growing conditions has led to a great deal of speculation about their potentials for reducing oil imports, stimulating rural economies, and even tackling hunger and poverty.⁴

At the domestic level, seaweed is seen not only as a source of nutritious food for populations, but also its culture and trade bring about the considerable enhancement of socio-economic livelihoods. The farming of seaweeds, particularly in the southern part of the country, generates income for more than 500,000 people from over 100,000 families living along coastlines and on the many islands. In addition, at least 10,000 job opportunities have been created through processing and other related activities.

The seaweed aquaculture sector in the Philippines is highly export-oriented. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, exports of seaweed in 2016 totaled nearly 43,000 tons at a customs declared value of USD 200 million.

Seaweeds contributed about 34% to the total 2008 fisheries production, with Regions IV-B, IX and BARMM as major producers. In BARMM, seaweed production has yielded the highest which equates to more or less 620,000 metric tons and followed by Region IV-B at around 400,000 metric tons. The steady increase in production can be attributed to high market demand, better price and good weather condition that encourage farmers to expand their areas for seaweed culture. The industry employs between 100,000-120,000 manpower where 90% are seaweed farmers and the rest are seaweed processors and traders.

What makes seaweed harvesting from the wild and farming attractive to coastal communities is that the technology is relatively simple, requires low capital investment, the crop can be harvested in six weeks and it can be dried on mats, grass or on the beach sand. Furthermore, as the farming areas are intertidal zones, women and children can safely access seaweed plots. These factors allow women, in particular, an important opportunity to earn some income for themselves and their families while the men work as fishermen and in other sectors.

The Bangsamoro Government must be aware of the need to ensure the sector's long-term economic and environmental development, in addition to continuing research in identifying fast growing, high yielding and disease-resistant varieties. It must be reiterated that seaweed and other is an essential source of nutritious food for human consumption; provides jobs for coastal communities and growers; and are essential components in a significantly wide range of food and non-food commercial industries.

We must be able to manage and improve seaweed culture and wild harvest techniques and output, so that the relevant socio-economic benefits are not lost and that the quality of the fresh or processed seaweed is maintained.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
