## Foreword

My warmest greetings to the officers, members, and staff of the Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority (BPDA) on the publication of the 2nd Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP) 2023-2028.

In keeping with your vision of becoming a premier center for socio-economic planning in the Bangsamoro region, I hope that the BDP 2023-2028 will serve as a guidepost as you address the most pressing problems that we face today. With your ability to formulate data-driven and research-based programs, you have the capacity to devise measures that are not only feasible, but also sustainable in the long run.

May this development plan also enable you to positively respond to the needs and expectations of Filipinos, filling the remaining gaps among our local sectors and boosting the progress of the BARMM and the entire country. I trust that it will further move our people to participate in strengthening our communities and reassuring that the government looks after their welfare as they cope with the changing realities of society.

Alongside your efforts to deliver quality services to the Filipino people, I am confident that your passion for service, love for fellows, and hope for the future will guide you in fortifying the key industries of our society. Rest assured that the administration is ever united with you in establishing a more informed, strategic, and progressive Philippines.

Congratulations on this accomplishment. Mabuhay tayong lahat!

## Message from NEDA

Living through a pandemic in this volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (or VUCA) world is a sure test of resilience and tenacity for all of us striving to bounce back from this unprecedented health and socioeconomic crisis. The challenge—as well as our plans and strategies—may have changed. Still, our long-term vision - the AmBisyon Natin 2040 — remains clear and firm: achieving a matatag, maginhawa, at panatag na buhay for all Filipinos by 2040.

Building upon the lessons learned in the last three years, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), in close coordination with other government agencies and stakeholders, formulated and completed the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2023-2028. As articulated in the Plan, our goal is to reinvigorate job creation and accelerate poverty reduction by steering the economy back to its high-growth path. We will work to achieve deep economic and social transformation for a prosperous, inclusive, and resilient society. Anchored on the 8-point Socioeconomic Agenda of President Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos, Jr., the PDP 2023-2028 contains strategies seeking to address both short-term challenges and medium-term constraints to economic growth. Short-term challenges, in particular, encompass concerns such as the rising prices of commodities due to global inflationary pressures, the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health and education, and the impact of global supply chain disruptions on employment and food security.

Addressing challenges of this magnitude requires a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach. The Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP) 2023-2028 is a testament to the region's commitment to transforming governance in Bangsamoro and harnessing the region's full potential in achieving economic transformation for prosperity, inclusivity, and resilience. On the other hand, the PDP highlights strategies to support a smooth and complete transition of the Bangsamoro government and strengthen intergovernmental coordination and collaboration.

Hence, I would like to convey my appreciation to the Bangsamoro Economic and Development Council for its commitment to formulating the BDP 2023-2028 and directing numerous regional development initiatives for an "empowered, cohesive, and progressive Bangsamoro." I would also like to thank the Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority for their participation in the formulation of the PDP. We look forward to a stronger, more productive partnership in the years ahead.

Finally, I call for the cooperation of our local government units, ministries and other offices, private institutions, non-government organizations, and members of civil society to join us in this collective endeavor. Through our united effort, we are a step closer to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, and resilient society in the BARMM and the whole country.

## Message from the Chief Minister

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem
Assalamu Alaykum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu!

In 2020, the Bangsamoro government formally launched the 1st Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP) 2020-2022, a three-year roadmap for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) which aims to uplift the lives of the Bangsamoro people and establish the foundations of self-governance. At the height of its implementation, the whole world was confronted by the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic - a global health crisis that brought enormous change to all aspects of life and our daily routines; our region, the BARMM, was no exception. Amid the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, BARMM's economic performance has increased despite being in a delicate transition period. According to the Philippines Statistics Authority (PSA), BARMM has recorded a significant rise in its economic performance by 7.5 percent in 2021 and a significant decline in poverty incidence since 2018.

However, the coverage of the 1st BDP ended on December 31, 2022. This prompted the interim Bangsamoro government to direct the Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority (BPDA), through the Bangsamoro Economic and Development Council (BEDC), to spearhead and jumpstart the initial assessment of the 1st BDP and 12-Point Priority Agenda as a preparation for the formulation of a successor plan.

During the process, the BEDC ensured an inclusive formulation of the 2nd BDP by soliciting inputs and recommendations from various stakeholders during the regionwide consultation in the region's mainland and island provinces. We consulted our provincial, city, and municipal local government units, academic institutions, business sector, and civil society organizations. As part of the extensive formulation of the 2nd BDP, series of workshops and writeshops which include the assessment of the 1st BDP and enhancement of the BARMM 12-Point Priority Agenda, as well as the simultaneous formulation of some essential documents such as the 1st Bangsamoro Ecological Profile (BEP), 1st BARMM Development Policy Research Agenda (BDPRA), and Bangsamoro Spatial Development Framework (BSDF).

After several months of arduously working on this document, it is with great pride and honor that I present the 2nd Bangsamoro Development Plan 2023-2028—a plan that will sustain the gains and pursue the development thrusts, priorities, and strategies of the Bangsamoro government that were outlined in the 1st BDP.

With its successful completion, I humbly acknowledge the contributions of all institutions who took part in crafting this development plan. This includes all the regional ministries, offices, and agencies of the BARMM and our ever-supportive development partners, The Asia Foundation (TAF), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and Support to Bangsamoro Transition (SUBATRA). I sincerely thank you all for your commitment and support. Indeed, with our collaborative efforts, we were able to craft a plan that will aid in transforming the Bangsamoro region by identifying durable solutions towards a smooth transition to normalization, sustaining peace, and attaining socioeconomic development in our region.

Finally, all praise and glory to Allah (SWT) for His grace and mercy over the Bangsamoro. May He continue to bless and guide us to implement this plan for the betterment of our beloved homeland and our people.

Shukran and Wassalam!

## Preface

Assalamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu.

All praises and thanks to the Almighty Allah (SWT) for the gift of wisdom and guidance to continue our commitment for the success of Bangsamoro including the completion of the 2nd Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP) 2023-2028, and its accompanying Results Matrices (RM), Bangsamoro Development Investment Program (BDIP), and BARMM Development Policy Research Agenda (BDPRA).

This successor plan of the 1st BDP 2020-2022 outlines the development priorities of the Bangsamoro government for its three-year extension period and beyond. It also serves as the basis for programming and utilization of the Special Development Fund (SDF) as provided under Article XIV, Section 2 of Republic Act (RA) No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL). It is also anchored to the 8-point socioeconomic agenda of the Marcos Administration, Philippine Development Plan (PDP), and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The 2nd BDP 2023-2028 consists of 14 chapters that highlights a broad, encompassing, and participatory planning methodology which focuses on the development agenda, thrusts, and priorities to address the significant challenges in the region.

The five sectoral planning committees of the BEDC namely: 1) Development Administration Committee (DACom), 2) Economic Development Committee (EDCom), 3) Social Development Committee (SDCom), 4) Infrastructure Development Committee (IDCom), and 5) Peace, Public Order, Safety and Security Committee (PPOSSCom) spearheaded the formulation of the plan through series of workshops, writeshops, and consultations involving the different BARMM ministries, six provinces (Maguindanao del Norte, Maguindanao del Sur, Lanao del Sur, Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi), three cities (Marawi City, Lamitan City, and Cotabato City), the Special Geographic Area (SGA), academe, and CSOs to ensure an inclusive, comprehensive, well-coordinated, and responsive medium-term plan that will guide the policymakers and development stakeholders in identifying strategies, and implement programs, and projects to attain the overall goal of the Bangsamoro region.

As the technical secretariat of the BEDC, the BPDA is honored to lead the successful formulation of the 2nd BDP 2023-2028, a plan that will continue the development initiatives of the Bangsamoro government to achieve an empowered, cohesive and progressive Bangsamoro.

Our deepest gratitude to our development partners and consultants for extending their full support since the beginning of the plan formulation process. May this strengthen our existing collaboration and partnership to realize our dreams and aspirations for the Bangsamoro.

Shukran and Wassalam!

# Chapter 1: BARMM and the Extended Transition

This chapter has three parts. The first part discusses the BARMM regional context before and the ongoing transition, the second part narrates the institutional context, and the third part talks about the extended transition and the salient features of the 2nd BDP 2023-2028.

## Regional Context

For decades, the region was in a "conflict trap", characterized by a sustained ebb and flow of violence that was precipitated by a myriad of actors, interests, triggers, and underlying causes. It was and still is in a fragile state. This fragility and the turbulent nature of the political landscape of the region came at a high cost: limited economic growth, a low level of human development, and gaps and disruptions in service delivery.

There were significant events aimed to have a lasting solution to these patterns of violence in the region. Among them include: the signing of the 1996 Final Peace Agreement (FPA) between the Government of the Philippines (GPH) and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) that led to the creation of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM); the signing of the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro (FAB) and the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB) between the GPH and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) under the Benigno Aquino administration; and, the ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) under the Duterte administration that replaced ARMM with BARMM as the new political entity.

The BOL and the installation of a new form of government signaled a new era in governance—Moral Governance. A 12-Point Priority Agenda was laid out with the intent of outlining the priorities within the transition period, which was then supported by the Bangsamoro Development Framework (BDF). This was later translated to a term-based plan called the 1st BDP which articulates moral governance in terms of sectoral outcomes, strategies, and priority programs, projects, and activities (PPAs).

The 1st BDP was an attempt to put in place a sense of predictability in the political and governance landscape of the region during the transition. It served as a development roadmap for the newly installed government and as a basis for annual programming and budgeting. It reflected the transformational results to be achieved within three years and the accompanying strategies, cognizant of the regional and institutional realities. As a regional plan, there was a deliberate effort to align with the PDP 2017-2022 and the 0-10 Socioeconomic Agenda of the Duterte administration.

Despite the significant promise and opportunities of the transition, its starting points were fraught with developmental and institutional challenges. These include: (1) high incidence of poverty; (2) lowest contribution to the national economy; (3) low performance outcomes on health and education; (4) continuing threats to peace, security, public order and safety; (5) insufficient infrastructure facilities; (6) vulnerability to climate change; (7) disruption in service delivery with the gradual phasing out of offices and personnel of the former ARMM; among others.

Based on the assessment of the BARMM performance, there were remarkable changes in the overall regional context. The region has high performance in achieving macroeconomic targets. Five out of six macroeconomic targets set in the 1st BDP were achieved.

### Table 1.1 Macroeconomic Targets set in the 1st BDP 2020-2022

| PERFORMANCE INDICATOR | BASELINE (as reflected in BDP) | END-OF-PLAN TARGET | STATUS | EVIDENCE/MOV |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GRDP Annual Growth Rate | 7.2% (2018) | 7.0% - 7.5% | 7.5% (2021) | Philippine Statistical Authority (PSA) Report |
| Population Growth Rate | 3.78% (2018) | 4.2% | 3.26% (2020) | PSA Report |
| Labor Force Participation Rate | 46.6% (2018) | 46.0% - 50.0% | 60% (2021) | PSA Report |
| Unemployment Rate | 3.7% (2018) | 3.0% | 7.60% (2021) | PSA Report |
| Inflation Rate | 7.09% (2018) | 4.5% - 5.0% | 2.40% (2021) | PSA Report |
| Poverty Incidence (among families) | 52.6% (2018) | 49.6% | 29.80% (2021) | PSA Report |

### Second fastest growing economy in the country

In 2021, BARMM registered 7.5 percent annual economic growth, the second highest growth rate in the country. It was a strong rebound from the -1.9 percent growth in 2020, which was largely caused by the pandemic. This is a strong manifestation that the region is on its way to recovery from the adverse effects of the pandemic.

In addition, BARMM is demonstrating to be moving at the same economic pace with its neighbors. The region registered the highest growth rate in 2017, 2018, 2020, and 2021 in Mindanao. At the time of the pandemic, it registered a decline of -1.9 percent, the lowest among the Mindanao regions.

Even though the BARMM's economic growth is at par with the national average, the regional contribution to national economic output is lowest at 1.4 percent.

### Structural transformation in BARMM's economic landscape

Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing (AFF) used to be the leading sector in BARMM 20 years ago, accounting for more than half of the region's economic output. The industry sector had the lowest contribution, accounting for less than 10 percent of the region's economic output.

A structural change is observed in the past 20 years. By 2021, the services sector replaced AFF as the leading sector, accounting for 36.41 percent of the region's economic output. But a dramatic leap was observed in the industry sector, which grew from 8.13 percent in 2000 to 24.65 percent in 2021 in terms of percentage share. This, however, does not indicate that the AFF has been weakening for the past years. This only indicates that the region is heading towards a balanced economy with the three main sectors moving and contributing significantly to the region's economic output.

### Figure 1.1 GRDP Percent Share, by sector, BARMM, 2000 vs. 2021

**2000:**
- Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing: 55.75%
- Industry: 8.13%
- Services: 36.12%

**2021:**
- Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing: 38.94%
- Industry: 24.65%
- Services: 36.41%

### Historic drop in the incidence of poverty in BARMM

Poverty incidence in the region dropped from 54.20 percent (or 380,000 families) in 2018 to only 29.80 percent (or 230,000 families) in 2021. Despite this historic drop, poverty incidence in the region remains to be the highest in the country.

The massive drop in poverty in the region can be attributed to the double-digit percentage drop in Lanao del Sur, Sulu, Basilan, and Maguindanao. It was only the province of Tawi-Tawi that registered an increase in poverty incidence in the region.

### Figure 1.2 Poverty Incidence by Region, 2018 vs. 2021

| Region | 2018 | 2021 |
|---|---|---|
| BARMM | 54.20% | 29.80% |

### Recovery of tourism and investments from the ill-effects of the pandemic

The pandemic put the tourism sub-sector on a standstill in 2020, causing tourist arrivals to drop to as low as 7,332. But renewed confidence and interest was recorded in 2021 when tourist arrivals grew by more than a thousand-fold, which was 195,822. However, despite the monumental increase in 2021, the number is still far below as compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2018 and 2019.

Investments plummeted from Php4.153 billion in 2019 to only Php14.0 million in 2020 due to the restrictions caused by the pandemic. Though still in the pandemic stage, investments rose to Php2.8 billion in 2021, more than a thousand-fold increase as compared to 2020. Total investments generated from 2019 to 2021 reached Php6.970 billion, which generated 5,020 jobs.

### A gradual shift towards formalization among the MSMEs

In 2021, a total of 8,427 micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) have been registered - a 161.46 percent increase from the number in 2020. It is the highest in a span of five years. Such an increase was a manifestation of the resilience of the Bangsamoro entrepreneurs given the lingering effects of the pandemic.

For two years (2020-2021), BARMM has registered 11,650 businesses through its five provincial offices including Cotabato City, created 31,000 jobs and generated an investment of around Php2.5 billion.

Despite the significant increase in business name registrations (BNR) in 2021, BARMM registered the lowest BNRs in the country, accounting for only 0.92 percent.

### Gains in peace and security

Crime-related incidents, deaths, and displacement dropped to a record low during the transition. However, land conflicts intensified in selected areas in 2020, and rido-related incidents persisted at the time of the pandemic. These, however, did not affect the overall regional stability. Generally, there is relative peace and security in the region during the transition period.

Threats to violent extremism remain endemic in selected localities, and challenges to pernicious shadow economies such as illicit firearms and illegal drug trade remain significant and require immediate attention and action in terms of policy and local support.

### Challenges in education and health outcomes remain impervious

Education performance outcomes in the region are still lowest in the country, and these have been further exacerbated by the pandemic. There was a significant learning loss in 2020 and 2021 as restrictions were imposed to protect the learners. A total of 143 barangays are considered school-less, and thousands of Madrasahs remain unaccredited, implying limited access to government support.

Access to public hospitals, rural health units (RHUs), barangay health stations (BHSs), and medical practitioners remains limited in the region, causing high rates of maternal mortality, infant mortality, and morbidity rates. Nutrition is also a gap, as the region registered the highest malnutrition rate. Access to basic safe water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities is the lowest in the country, explaining the high stunting rate and morbidity rate among children.

### Increasing vulnerability to the effects of climate change

The region is increasingly becoming vulnerable to natural calamities, particularly flooding in low-lying areas, resulting in deaths, displacement, and loss of properties. The typhoon "Paeng" which hit the country on October 28, 2022 caused flooding and landslides, resulting in 61 deaths and homes covered in mud. The casualty in the region was the highest in the country.

## BARMM Institutional Context

### The birth of a new political entity

The passage of RA No. 11054 "An Act Providing for the Organic Law for the BARMM, repealing for the purpose RA No. 6734 as amended by RA No. 9054, entitled 'An Act to Strengthen and Expand the Organic Act for the ARMM,'" paved the way for the establishment of a new political entity. On July 27, 2018, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte signed it into law, and was ratified through a plebiscite in early 2019. The ratification of RA No. 11054, also known as the BOL, commenced the transition of the defunct ARMM into the BARMM, a new autonomous regional government.

### A shift in the system of governance

The birth of this new political entity was confronted with various challenges, specifically with changes in government structure and political leadership. A unitary system of governance was adopted by the ARMM government. However, with the change of political entity through the ratification of the BOL, the Bangsamoro government is currently adopting a parliamentary system of governance in running the BARMM. Indeed, birthing pains in establishing this new political entity are being endured by the Bangsamoro government, which started with the shifting of the system of governance during the transition of the ARMM to BARMM.

### Transitioning from ARMM to BARMM, the appointment of interim officers, and the execution of powers

As stated in Article XVI, Section 1 of RA No. 11054, the transition period for the establishment of the BARMM commenced upon the ratification of the BOL. BARMM seeks to foster genuine autonomy, moral governance, and improve fiscal management in the region. However, the transition from ARMM to BARMM is a very significant change that brings enormous challenges to the Bangsamoro government.

Following the ratification of the BOL was the creation of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) as the interim government in the BARMM, holding both legislative and executive powers during the transition period.

President Rodrigo R. Duterte appointed Ahod B. Ebrahim as the interim Chief Minister of the Bangsamoro government, bearing the executive power and authority over the region, while Atty. Pangalian M. Balindong was appointed as the BTA Parliament Speaker along with the other members of the Parliament holding the legislative power and authority in the BARMM.

Thereafter, Chief Minister Ahod B. Ebrahim submitted to the BTA Parliament a transition plan last June 17, 2019, that served as the initial basis and guide for the organizational plan, schedule of phasing out of employees, and other transition mechanisms of the six priority codes. The proposed transition plan was voted on by the majority of the Members of Parliament, and thus, approved by the BTA Parliament. With its approval, the Bangsamoro government began organizing the interim Cabinet, but the implementation of the transition plan affected the usual government operations, which hampered the delivery of services across the region. On the other hand, the transition period shall end upon the dissolution of the BTA as provided in the BOL.

### Phasing out of ARMM offices, separation of ARMM personnel, and transfer of powers and properties

The commencement of the transition signaled a full transfer of powers, functions, and properties of the ARMM government to the BARMM government, except for those properties, land, and structures located outside the ARMM. All ARMM offices were deemed abolished upon ratification of the BOL, resulting in the reorganization of the bureaucracy. The Bangsamoro government was able to implement the gradual phasing out of employees. However, this also caused a minimal disruption in the continuity of government services.

Further, the disposition and separation from government service also brought confusion to the majority of ARMM personnel. Nevertheless, the Bangsamoro government executed Section 10, Article XVI of RA No. 11054 which states that "All affected personnel who will not be absorbed in the positions of the new staffing pattern of the different offices in the Bangsamoro government, whether hired on a permanent, temporary, casual, or contractual basis and with appointments attested by the Civil Service Commission (CSC), shall be entitled to applicable retirement or separation benefits as provided in this Organic Law." Therefore, retired and separated ARMM personnel were given due compensation for the services they had rendered to the government.

In consideration of the public interest and continuity in the delivery of services, ARMM officials holding appointive positions were retained to continue performing their functions in accordance with the phase-out schedule. Despite retaining those officials, most of the offices faced difficulties especially with the technical and field operations because many employees from the defunct ARMM were not retained nor absorbed by their office.

Meanwhile, the employees coming from the sectors of health, education, and social welfare have been absorbed and transferred to the Bangsamoro government.

### Organization of bureaucracy—merging, restructuring, and creation of new offices in the BARMM

Even being guided by the transition plan, the merging and restructuring of offices connotes major changes in operations and services. The mandates of the offices being merged and restructured became bigger, yet the number of employees did not equate to the number of jobs to be done to effectively implement the mandate of the merged offices.

Among the merged and restructured offices are the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education (MBHTE), Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Agrarian Reform (MAFAR), Ministry of Trade, Investments, and Tourism (MTIT), Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources, and Energy (MENRE), and Ministry of Finance and Budget and Management (MFBM).

### Hiring of new BARMM personnel

With the organization of the new bureaucracy, the BTA has established an independent, strictly merit-based and credible placement and hiring process in all BARMM MOAs. The Bangsamoro Job Portal—an online platform where all applicants have equal opportunity to apply for any vacant positions in different ministries, offices, and agencies of the Bangsamoro government—was established.

As of December 2022, the Bangsamoro government received more than 600,000 job applications for around 7,725 positions posted on the Bangsamoro Job Portal. Aside from the plantilla posted in the job portal, there are thousands of job orders and contracts of services in different MOAs that are not posted in the said portal. This high volume of hopefuls vying for a position in the BARMM was overwhelming as it reflected their desire to be part of the Bangsamoro government.

Given this figure, the Bangsamoro government was receiving a backlash from the public, particularly from the applicants who were inquisitive about the hiring process. Currently, most of the vacant and available positions posted in the portal were already filled up.

### Inclusion of Cotabato City and SGA to the BARMM

Following the passage and ratification of the BOL, Cotabato City and SGA formed part of the Bangsamoro territory after they favorably voted for inclusion in the BARMM during the plebiscite.

The Bangsamoro government faced challenges in the inclusion of these areas in the regional planning and budgeting processes due to delays in the formal turnover of these areas to BARMM and perceived resistance of the City Government of Cotabato pending the decision for the protest they filed before the Supreme Court.

However, the Bangsamoro government was able to surpass these concerns through the issuance of an Executive Order (EO) issued by the Chief Minister on January 20, 2020, creating the Development Coordinating Office (DCO) tasked to administer the planning and implementation of PPAs of the MOAs in the SGA.

Further, Cotabato City officially became part of the BARMM on December 15, 2020 after a formal turnover of the supervision of Cotabato City to BARMM by the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Central Office.

## The BARMM extended transition

President Duterte signed on October 28, 2021 the law extending the transition period of BARMM from 2022 to 2025, thereby postponing the first regional parliamentary elections in the region. RA No. 11593 stipulates that the first parliamentary elections shall be held and synchronized with the 2025 national elections. It also stipulates that the BTA shall continue as the interim government during the extension of the transition period and the President may appoint the 80 new members of the BTA, who shall serve up to June 30, 2025 or until their successors shall have been elected. The BTA will continue to be MILF-led.

## The 2nd BDP 2023-2028

### Legal Basis

As the 1st BDP is now in its final term, the Office of the Chief Minister issued Memorandum Order No. 0092, directing all heads of ministries, offices, and agencies for the formulation of the 2nd BDP, Results Matrices (RM), and the Bangsamoro Development and Investment Program (BDIP) for 2023-2028. The 2nd BDP is envisioned to sustain the gains and pursue the development direction, priorities, and strategies outlined in the 1st BDP.

The formulation of the 2nd BDP commenced with the conduct of a rigorous review and assessment of the 12-Point Priority Agenda and the 1st BDP 2020-2022. The assessment findings and recommendations served as guideposts in the design of the 2nd BDP process.

### Approach

A whole-sector approach was adopted in the planning process. The five BEDC sectoral committees and special committee were the mechanisms tapped in the four phases of the planning process. The BPDA as the technical secretariat of the BEDC was instrumental in ensuring that the sectoral and special committees were mobilized in crafting the strategic directions of their respective sectors and assigned chapters.

### Cross-cutting themes

While moral governance is the overarching guiding principle, this is being operationalized in the 2nd BDP in terms of inclusion, equity, and justice. These three elements served as the cross-cutting themes and, to some extent, the guiding principles in crafting the strategic directions of the five sectors of the 2nd BDP.

### Planning Standards and Principles

**Building on the gains.** There was a recognition that key results, particularly outcomes, and the corresponding strategies in the 1st BDP are still relevant and significant for adoption in the 2nd BDP 2023-2028.

**BOL as the policy anchor.** The stipulations in the BOL served as the policy framework of the strategic directions in each of the sectors. As the framework, it provides the coverage or the limits in terms of rights, powers, and authority to exercise and the mechanisms and systems to create.

**Moral governance as the guidepost.** Moral governance continues to be the guidepost in terms of leadership and overall service delivery, but this will be operationalized through its cross-cutting themes of inclusion, equity, and justice for the next six years.

**Vertical and horizontal alignment.** There was a deliberate effort to ensure that the 2nd BDP was vertically aligned to the SDG, 8-point Socioeconomic Agenda of the Marcos administration, PDP 2023-2028, and the Mindanao Development Agenda. Coordination meetings were conducted with NEDA Central Office and NEDA Regional Office (NRO) XII. Close coordination was also conducted with MinDA to ensure alignment with the Mindanao Development Agenda. The Bangsamoro Spatial Strategy was a byproduct of such close coordination.

In terms of horizontal alignment, it was ensured that the 2nd BDP was able to translate the priorities set in the enhanced 12-Point Priority Agenda into specific strategies and initiatives. In addition, the ranked priority list of projects reflected in the BDIP was based on the list in the 2nd BDP. The annual priorities in the BDIP will be the basis for the Annual Investment Program (AIP), which will serve as the basis for the General Appropriations Act for the Bangsamoro (GAAB).

Coordination was conducted with several ministries for the sectoral plans such as the Gender and Development (GAD) plan, Disaster Risk Reduction and Management - Climate Change Adaptation (DRRM-CCA) plan, Camps Transformation Plan (CTP), Bangsamoro Food Security and Nutrition (BFSN) plan, among others, to ensure its alignment in terms of results, strategies, and priority programs and projects.

**Evidence-based.** Data from the different agencies with the mandate to produce official estimates were used in formulating the sectoral profile and trends. Majority of the data were taken from the PSA and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). Data systems of agencies such as the Enhanced Basic Education Information System (EBEIS) of the MBHTE and the Field Health Services Information System (FHSIS) of the Ministry of Health (MOH) were key sources of data.

Various literatures were also used to ensure that claims are supported with research or scientific inquiry.

**Strategic or critical thinking.** One of the biggest investments of this planning process was strategy formulation because strategies are the direct link between results and initiatives. Several consultations and workshops were conducted to ensure that the strategies formulated were not only effective in addressing the "wicked" problems but also have multiplier or cascading effects. Strategies are the link between the desired result and the interventions. There will be no program that will be implemented that is not anchored to a strategy. The sectoral committees referred to the clusters in the objective tree and formulated a strategy. Each strategy should be able to address multiple critical issues in the problem tree.

**Inclusive and participatory.** Consultations with the provincial, municipal, city, and barangay LGUs, CSOs, academe, private sectors, and other stakeholders were also conducted for an inclusive and participatory planning. The five sectors were meaningfully engaged in problem analysis, target setting and strategy formulation, investment programming, and results-based monitoring and evaluation.

### Strategic shifts from the 1st BDP

**Setting targets.** A shift from point estimate to a range of values was undertaken in setting targets to accommodate internal and external shocks that are oftentimes beyond government or state control. In addition, annual average growth rates as opposed to annual growth rate were used because the sustained or long-term performance is more critical as opposed to a one-time or annual performance. Further, measures of inequality and severity have been added as indicators of performance.

**Defining accountabilities.** The notion of "objectives" is being introduced in the 2nd BDP. This is to make the distinction which accountabilities are at the sectoral level, the sub-sector level, and at the institutional level.

**Emphasis on strategy.** Strategy is treated as the unifying element as this is the direct link between targeted results and the initiatives. This implies that no program or project will be proposed and implemented that is not anchored to a development strategy. The strategies have been instrumental in promoting vertical and horizontal alignment. This also implies that regional strategies have to be at some points supporting international and national strategies. Likewise provincial, city, and municipal strategies have to be supporting regional strategies. Contextualization can be done in terms of programs and projects, but alignment at the strategy level must be pursued.

### Process

**Assessment of 12-Point Priority Agenda and the 1st BDP.** In anticipation to update the 12-Point Priority Agenda and the formulation of a successor plan of the 1st BDP, the BEDC sectoral committees started a series of assessment activities in January 2022.

**Issuance of memorandum.** Memorandum Circular No. 0092 was issued on May 16, 2022, directs the BEDC through its five sectoral committees to spearhead the 2nd BDP formulation process with assistance from the BPDA being the technical secretariat. The said memorandum also mandates the BEDC sectoral committees to initiate and draft the BDIP and the RM as accompanying documents.

**Situational analysis and problem analysis.** Several studies and assessment reports were used in formulating the sectoral profile and trends. The five BEDC sectoral committees underwent problem analysis using the Strength-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) analysis, Political-Economic-Sociological-Technological-Legal-Environmental (PESTLE), and the Problem Tree analysis as tools.

**Target setting and strategy formulation.** The five BEDC sectoral committees formulated the sectoral goals and objectives based on the Objective Tree analysis. The sectoral goal and objectives reflect the transformational results to be achieved by the end of 2028. This is supported by Indicator-Baseline-Target Matrix.

The biggest investment was strategy formulation because not only the strategies should be distinct from activities, but they should be able to demonstrate a cascading or broad-based effect. Strategies are the link between the desired result and the interventions. There will be no program that will be implemented that is not anchored to a strategy. The sectoral committees referred to the clusters in the objective tree and formulated a strategy. Each strategy should be able to address multiple critical issues in the problem tree.

**Investment programming.** The five BEDC sectoral committees underwent a rigorous prioritization process of projects using the Conflict-Compatibility-Complementarity Matrix, Urgency Test, and the Goal Achievement Matrix (GAM). The output was a ranked list of priority projects with individual and cumulative cost estimates. Stream 2 of investment programming was determining the investible funds and stream 3 delved into matching the fund requirements with projected funds available and deciding on financing options should the funds available are insufficient.

**Results-based monitoring and evaluation.** A Results Matrix (RM) was formulated that covers the full hierarchy of results with baseline, targets, and means of verification. The RM is being supported with a Performance Measurement System (PMS) to reflect the institutional accountabilities and arrangements.

**LGU consultations and validation.** Strategic directions reflected in the draft 2nd BDP were presented during the LGU consultations and validation workshops. These were participated by representatives of six provincial governments, three city governments, 75 municipal governments, 142 barangay governments, 49 CSOs, three academic institutions, five private sector organizations, and BARMM MOAs.

### Accompanying Documents

The 2nd BDP has three accompanying documents. These are:

**Bangsamoro Development Investment Program (BDIP).** The BDIP contains the list of priority programs and projects, financing options, and the development approach to be undertaken.

**Results Matrices (RM).** The RM presents the hierarchy of results with indicators and means of verification. It delineates levels of accountabilities at the sectoral level, sub-sector level, and at the institutional level.

**Bangsamoro Development Policy and Research Agenda (BDPRA).** The BDPRA contains a detailed accounting of policy research requirements that have to be pursued within the term of the 2nd BDP. It guides how the enabling environment can be further enhanced to push the reforms forward.

# Chapter 2: Regional trends and prospects for development

The next six years will hold several challenges for the BARMM as it navigates a critical transition period until 2025, while attempting to sustain the dividends of peace amidst tackling the hurdles brought by COVID-19 and the broader development challenges.

Several trends and developments at the global and regional levels have and may affect the region as well. It is therefore imperative that the Bangsamoro government takes these current and emerging trends into account when charting its development directions for the next six years.

As the BARMM works towards achieving an empowered, cohesive, and progressive Bangsamoro, it will have to strategically navigate through the political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental landscapes.

#### 7.9 million more people in BARMM by 2030, with the greatest increase in Lanao del Sur

BARMM's population is projected to reach 5,250,500 by 2030. This indicates a 1,986,400 increase in the population of the region in ten years.

### Table 2.3 BARMM Projected Population 2010-2030

| REGION | 2010 | 2015 | 2020 | 2025 | 2030 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Philippines | 93,135,100 | 101,562,300 | 109,947,900 | 117,959,400 | 125,337,500 |

*Source: PSA, 2010 Census-Based Population Projections*

Throughout the projection period (2010-2030), the population of the six provinces of BARMM would continue to increase, albeit at a slower rate. Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao del Norte and del Sur, and Sulu will contain more than 1 million people and have the largest populations by 2030, with 1.5 million, 1.4 million, and 1.1 million persons, respectively, by 2030. Populations of Tawi-Tawi and Basilan are expected to reach 588,500 and 497,900, respectively, in the said period.

#### Projected rapid growth of the working-age population

Overall, the projected population in BARMM from 2010 to 2030 will increase across broad age groups. Ages 0 to 14 will have a gradual but consistent growth in population over the projection period. By 2030, the number of people in this age group will increase to 1,843,400, a rise of approximately 457,000 individuals.

BARMM's working-age population (15-64 years old) is also expected to grow, reaching 3.2 million in 2030. This is an increase of 1.4 million people compared to 2010.

Moreover, the number of people in BARMM aged 65 and older is projected to expand four-fold, representing a jump from 53,500 individuals in 2010 to 202,200 in 2030. While the number of people within this age group is expected to increase continuously, it will not be able to keep up with the rapidly growing number of people of the working age. The number of women in BARMM between the ages of 15 and 49 is expected to show a consistent growth pattern, going from 838,000 in 2010 to 1,355,200 in 2030.

### Table 2.5 BARMM Projected Population by Selected Age Group, 2010-2030

| REGION | 2010 | 2015 | 2020 | 2025 | 2030 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pop 0-14 | 1,386,400 | 1,461,800 | 1,580,100 | 1,741,400 | 1,843,400 |
| Pop 15-64 | 1,824,200 | 2,173,900 | 2,517,600 | 2,839,600 | 3,204,900 |

*Source: PSA, 2010 Census-Based Population Projections*

Among the BARMM provinces, Lanao del Sur is projected to register the largest increase in the working-age population by 2030, growing from 512,100 in 2010 to 941,900. Maguindanao comes next and is projected to gain 913,600 in its working-age population throughout the projection period, followed by Sulu at 686,200.

Tawi-Tawi and Basilan are expected to experience slow but steady growth. Approximately 364,900 people will be working-age in Tawi-Tawi by 2030 from 210,500 in 2010. Over the next 20 years, Sulu will gain 264,900 people aged 15-64 years, growing from 421,300 in 2010 to 686,200 in 2030.

### Prospects

#### Reaping the demographic dividend

BARMM is well positioned for accelerated economic growth and social development as a result of the high percentage of its population in the working age group (15-64 years old) in 2020. The population projections (2010 to 2030) also signify the potential for BARMM to reap a demographic dividend.

The region's economic growth potential will likely be very high if this projected population growth is realized, especially for the working-age population, as there will be a greater number of people in the workforce relative to the number of dependents.

To reap the full benefits of a favorable age distribution, the Bangsamoro government must invest further in human capital development by assuring access to health care and quality education for all ages, as well as increasing opportunities for productive employment and decent labor.

## Political

### Trends

#### New leadership making headways

The Bangsamoro government is confronted with enormous challenges in setting up the necessary structures, processes, and mechanisms to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of services to the Bangsamoro. With a complex transition process, combined with the compounding effects of COVID-19, tackling the region's development challenges is doubly difficult for BARMM as a fledgling government.

Building a bureaucracy is not an easy task; however, the Bangsamoro government has been making significant strides in institution building. The Bangsamoro government has doubled its efforts to operationalize the newly established offices and fill key positions within the government. Subsequently, developing the capacities of new civil servants and newly established institutions will be a high priority for the new leadership. This is a critical component of this effort to cultivate effective public service.

#### Moral governance as an instrumentality for inclusion, equity, and justice

It has been a central component of the Bangsamoro government's efforts to create a more empowered, cohesive, and progressive Bangsamoro that has always put moral governance as a critical underpinning principle to ensure inclusivity, equity, and justice within the Bangsamoro.

#### Shift in the system of governance

The birth of this new political entity faced various challenges. Most notably, changes in government structures and political leadership. The ARMM adopted a unitary government system. However, with the change in political entity following the ratification of the BOL, the Bangsamoro government has adopted a parliamentary system in running the BARMM. As mentioned above, the Bangsamoro government is continuously strengthening its effort in establishing this new political structure.

#### Policy support in relation to fiscal autonomy in-place

According to Section 1, Article XII of the BOL, "The Bangsamoro Government shall enjoy fiscal autonomy with the end in view of attaining economic self-sufficiency and genuine development." This means that the Bangsamoro government has the power to create its own sources of revenue in addition to the equitable share in the national taxes from the national government and block grant and prepare its budget and allocate this revenue within the bounds of the BOL. The Bangsamoro government has now the power to pass annual regional appropriations law through the Parliament in accordance with the needs and priorities of the region.

Through the annual block grant, the national government can automatically provide a sum equal to 5 percent of the net national internal revenue tax collections generated by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and the Bureau of Customs (BOC). This is the fiscal autonomy granted to the Bangsamoro government to control over its appropriations.

In addition to the annual block grant, the Bangsamoro government's taxing powers have also been expanded. It shall have the power to levy taxes, fees, and charges, but are subject to provisions of the Organic Law. Other than tariff and customs duties, the Bangsamoro government shares in national government taxes, fees, and charges collected in the BARMM are increased to 75 percent, inclusive of the shares of its constituent LGUs.

#### LGUs' functionality and performance demonstrating progress

During the start of a transition of leadership from ARMM to BARMM, LGUs' functionality was recorded at 45 percent (or 56 LGUs) of the 123 LGUs in ARMM. The Ministry of Interior and Local Government (MILG) has strategized its implementation of PPAs that include the giving of incentives to performing local governments. The tool used by the ministry was the Performance Audit and Compliance Tracking System (PACTS).

In 2021, the functionality rate jumped to 80 percent, which is equivalent to 98 LGUs. This remarkable increase shows that the strategy of incentivizing the performing LGUs is a good way of enticing others to do the same. Incentives were given in the form of a project amounting to Php1.5 million. A menu of projects was also given for the performing LGUs to choose from such as support to social, education, revenue generation, and disaster-related projects.

The ministry treated it as its regular program that serves as a support mechanism to the Seal of Good Local Governance (SGLG) being implemented by the DILG. The BARMM recorded 28 LGUs as passers in the prestigious search for SGLG, making the region ranked 1st out of the six regions in Mindanao and ranked 3rd out of 17 regions in the Philippines that passed and awarded with SGLG.

### Prospects

#### The Bangsamoro Electoral Code and democratic process in BARMM

There is much anticipation about the passage of the Bangsamoro Electoral Code, which is perceived to pave the way for a more democratic and credible system of electoral processes in BARMM to ensure genuine, credible, free, open, and honest elections.

#### Towards a more stable and stronger bureaucracy

In the coming years, BARMM will be seeing a stable and stronger governance system with the amount of progress made and the continuing effort to build and strengthen the bureaucracy.

#### Policy support to harness revenue generation needed

BARMM's revenue generation capacity will be boosted by the passage of the Bangsamoro Revenue Code. It shall cover the taxing powers of the Bangsamoro government. The BARMM is optimistic that this Code will act as a catalyst for boosting revenue collection and enhancing the overall revenue generation, thereby contributing to the improvement of the quality of the delivery of services in the region.

#### Well-defined relationship between BARMM and its constituent LGUs

The Bangsamoro Local Government Code shall strengthen the supervisory powers of the Bangsamoro government through the MILG and provide clear guidance on the relationship between the Bangsamoro government and its constituent LGUs.

Through this proposed Code, it is expected that the Bangsamoro government will develop a more responsive and accountable local governments in the region.

#### Implementation of the Mandanas-Garcia ruling poses opportunities and challenges

The implementation of the Mandanas-Garcia ruling in BARMM will equip LGUs with more resources to implement its devolved functions. However, the implementation should be accompanied with a range of capacity development support in terms of the structure, policies, skills, mechanisms, and systems and processes.

#### Strong support of national government and international development partners

The BARMM is strongly supported by the national government and international development partners in its efforts for institutionalization and socioeconomic development. Their assistance has significant contribution in BARMM's efforts toward a peaceful transition.

The national government has been a major player in the process of achieving long-term peace in the BARMM. Peace dividends have been sustained due to the joint efforts of the GPH and the MILF. The ongoing decommissioning of MILF combatants, which is one of the key provisions of the Annex on Normalization of the CAB, is a specific indication of strengthened partnership between the GPH and the MILF.

The development partners have also played an important role as knowledge and resource brokers, allowing the BARMM to bring together relevant stakeholders from the international, national, and local levels to promote sustainable and inclusive peace and development in the Bangsamoro region. The Bangsamoro government was heavily supported by development partners in charting its development direction through their assistance during BARMM's delicate transition. Also, the development partners have contributed in the region's response and recovery efforts to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Economic

### Trends

#### Second fastest-growing economy in the country

The ARMM experienced the highest economic growth in 2017, registered at 10.1 percent. However, the region's economic performance decelerated in 2018 and 2019 at 7.7 percent and 5.8 percent, respectively. Though the economy of ARMM was growing, the region had the lowest contribution to the overall economic output of the country due to the nature of its economic base, being a producer of raw materials.

According to the PSA, the economy of the BARMM decelerated from a positive rate in 2019 of 5.8 percent to -1.9 percent in 2020. However, the regional economy strongly recovered in 2021, registering a 7.5 percent increase, the second highest growth rate in the country. The region's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate was mainly fueled by AFF at 8.3 percent, industry at 7.9 percent, and services at 6.6 percent.

However, it should be noted that BARMM, which is still in transition, continues to make minimal economic contribution despite its positive economic development. The region's share of the national economy averaged at 1.0 percent between 2010 and 2018, making it the smallest region's share of the country's overall economic performance.

#### Bigger role of industry and services

Over the last two decades, structural changes have been observed. In 2021, the services sector replaced AFF as the leading sector, accounting for 36.40 percent of the region's overall economic output. The industry sector has also seen a dramatic rise from 8.13 percent in 2000 to 24.70 percent in 2021.

However, this does not mean that the AFF has weakened in recent years. AFF remains to be one of the most important sub-sectors in the economic sector. It played a major role in the economic resiliency of the region at the time of the pandemic. It remains to be the main source of food, employment, and income of most of the Bangsamoro households. This only indicates that the region is heading towards a balanced economy. Industry and services are now playing a bigger role and contribute significantly to the region's economic output.

#### Idle land assets and untapped tourism and investment potentials

BARMM sees numerous opportunities to revitalize the region's economy, owing to its abundant natural resources and diverse rural topography, which includes vast tracts of fertile land and marine resources. BARMM is also endowed with natural landscapes and environment, beaches, historical landmarks, and sceneries comparable to known tourist destinations in the Philippines. It has a wide range of flora and fauna, pristine white sandy-beaches, crystalline spring water and towering waterfalls, and a variety of tourist attractions.

Due to this competitive advantage, the Bangsamoro region is viewed as a viable source for producing goods or services at a lower opportunity cost than its trading counterparts. A growing tourism industry is also emerging in BARMM. The Bangsamoro government is making unprecedented investments in tourism. The opening of an inter-regional airline route between Cotabato City and Bongao in Tawi-Tawi province marks an important milestone in promoting tourism in the region.

### Prospects

#### Agriculture development to move at a faster rate

The AFF sector is expected to grow at a faster rate as more lands will be opened for agricultural investments and industry players will have better access to technology, market information, and government support.

#### Expanding industry and services sectors

Construction, real estate, trade, tourism, and investment are perceived as the sunrise industries in the region as the gains in the peace process and overall regional stability will boost investors' confidence.

#### Halal industry growing and expanding markets

Halal industry development is viewed as a very promising investment opportunity. The BARMM is a potential market for Halal-compliant products due to its large Muslim population. The region is also geographically well-situated due to its proximity to most major cities in Mindanao, its access to international maritime routes, and its strategic location along the Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) trade corridor.

#### Islamic finance as a component driver of socioeconomic development

The pursuit of an operational and functional Islamic finance system in the Philippines remains as important and urgent. The current financial system, which is still largely fueled by interest-based and conventional transactions and instruments, does not conform to the needs, identity, aspirations, and way of life of the Bangsamoro.

With this, some Bangsamoro and other Muslim Filipinos were not able to participate in the financial system as exemplified by the very low rate of financial inclusion across the region. This means that a vast number of constituents in the BARMM are excluded from accessing useful and affordable financial products and services that are supposed to meet their needs and improve their overall quality of life.

Cognizant of the pressing need to provide an alternative financial system that is responsive to the needs and aspirations of the Bangsamoro, and recognizing the importance of establishing Islamic finance as a component driver of socioeconomic development, the OCM issued Memorandum Circular No. 0012 in 2021 creating a technical working group for Islamic finance in the BARMM. It primarily aims to develop a roadmap for the comprehensive promotion and development of Islamic finance in the region. This was followed by the issuance of Joint Circular dated 26 April 2022 and a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) dated 04 May 2022 between the Bangsamoro government, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMEF), and the Department of Finance on establishing the Shari'ah Supervisory Board in the BARMM.

In creating the enabling environment for the Islamic finance industry, the Bangsamoro government develops the roadmap for the promotion and development of Islamic finance in the region. It offers a workable and grounded framework intended mainly to serve as a guide in designing the region's Islamic finance development and strategic pathways in a manner that supports and fits seamlessly into bigger socioeconomic development trajectories and objectives. It also lays the foundations for the continuing and sustainability-oriented directions for stakeholders, industry, and inter-governmental dialogue, cooperation, and collaboration.

As part of its holistic approach, the roadmap's strategic thrusts are designed for the Islamic financial services providers, consumers and end users, government regulators, and environment enablers. This translates to interventions that will establish and institutionalize Islamic banks, Islamic microfinance, Islamic pawn brokering or "ar-rahnu", Islamic insurance or "takaful", and the Islamic capital market. Moreover, "zakah", "waqf", and "hajj" financing are important complementary industries and services to the overall development of an Islamic finance ecosystem. Cross-cutting strategies will include the development of human capital, and institutional, regulatory, and market environment.

#### Tighter BIMP-EAGA economic integration

The economic integration through the BIMP-EAGA opens up opportunities for trade and investment. Advancing BARMM's integration in the BIMP-EAGA trade window has been regarded as a means of stimulating its development as a strategic player, as well as increasing its economic competitiveness within Mindanao and the BIMP-EAGA region.

In June 2022, the MinDA and the Bangsamoro government through the BPDA inked a Memorandum of Cooperation aimed at fostering stronger partnership and collaboration to scale up efforts towards more robust participation of BARMM in the BIMP-EAGA and other Mindanao development initiatives. This collaboration is also seen as advancing long-term peace and development across Mindanao and BARMM.

To pursue this integration to the BIMP-EAGA, the BARMM and the national government must promote sustainable and competitive cross-border trading and trade investments, increase strategic infrastructure including digital connectivity, develop value chains for priority commodities with high trade and processing potential, mainstream sustainable and climate-resilient resource management, and strengthen partnerships for knowledge exchange and capacity building.

## Social

### Trends

#### Low human development index but gradual improvement in accessing health and education services

BARMM has the lowest human development index (HDI) in the country, particularly on the performance outcomes in the areas of health and education as well as standard of living. The HDI for BARMM was the lowest of all the regions in 2017. BARMM's score on HDI in 2019 was categorized as medium human development, which is also the lowest in the Philippines. The three provinces with the lowest HDI or low human development in the country are all from BARMM namely, Sulu, Maguindanao, and Lanao del Sur.

#### Historic drop in poverty but remains to be the highest in the country

Poverty remains a major challenge in the region. Poverty incidence in the ARMM continues to rise from 55.8 percent in 2012 to 53.7 percent in 2015. Among the regions of the country, ARMM registered the highest poverty incidence at 61.3 percent in 2018. This rate is almost four times the national poverty incidence posted at 16.6 percent in 2018. The three provinces of the ARMM namely, Sulu, Basilan, and Lanao del Sur, were among the poorest provinces in the country in 2018.

BARMM's poverty incidence plummeted to 29.80 percent in 2021 as compared to 54.20 percent in 2018. However, this rate is still high when compared to the national poverty incidence posted at 23.7 percent in 2021.

#### Gains in overall regional peace and security but threats remain a concern

In recent years, the region has seen sporadic violence, particularly in relation to horizontal armed conflicts like clan feuds/"rido" and other forms of violence such as organized crime, and gender-based violence, among others. There is still a threat to the region's peace, public order, and security. Therefore, strategic efforts to prevent and counter violent extremism, formation of private armies, rise in number of crimes, and other types of threat and violence in the region should remain a top priority.

In addition, efforts to build peace should be directed toward addressing the causes and factors that contribute to instability to lessen the likelihood of the occurrence of violent conflict. COVID-19 also came at a critical time in BARMM's transition period, adding another layer of challenges to the Bangsamoro government's peacebuilding efforts.

#### Normalization process has been sluggish

In 2014, the MILF and the GPH reached a peace deal through the signing of the CAB. Normalization is an important component of the peace process as outlined in the CAB. The Annex on Normalization defines normalization as the process by which communities can attain their desired quality of life, including sustainable livelihood and political participation within a peaceful deliberative society.

Little progress has been observed in the implementation of the normalization process and its essential components, including but not limited to the deployment of peacekeeping teams to bolster conflict mitigation efforts, Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC), the decommissioning of MILF combatants, and confidence building measures such as amnesty and pardon and transformation of the six MILF-acknowledged camps into peaceful and productive communities.

There was a relatively positive start to the normalization process, but COVID-19 has significantly slowed it down over the past years. Efforts to reintegrate former combatants have been hindered by the pandemic by limiting the already scarce funding for Normalization and restricting the mobility of implementers, particularly in the implementation of the socioeconomic programs for decommissioned MILF members and their communities.

#### Camp transformation has yet to be realized but will soon get underway

Camp transformation, a critical aspect of Normalization as noted above, has so far remained largely unfulfilled. In spite of this, a funding mechanism has already been established to support the process of normalization, so it will be possible to move forward with the implementation phase in the following months.

The Bangsamoro Normalization Trust Fund (BNTF), which had its official launch in 2021 will finance, coordinate, and oversee the delivery of assistance from international partners and other donors during the implementation of the normalization process. This assistance will primarily be used for development efforts as well as the rehabilitation, reconstruction, and development of Bangsamoro communities, particularly six previously acknowledged MILF Camps (Abubakar, Omar, Badre, Rajamuda, Bushra, and Bilal), as well as vulnerable sectors across BARMM.

#### Recovery in COVID-19 pandemic

BARMM is not immune to the negative repercussions of COVID-19, especially since the pandemic has struck at a critical juncture in the region's transition period. While the region is still reeling from the negative effects of the pandemic, BARMM is also addressing the challenges brought on by the transition period. COVID-19 has posed a direct challenge to the peace and development in the region by straining the Bangsamoro government's peacebuilding efforts, driving up competition for scarce resources in localities with historical tension, and shifting institutional focus away from building inclusive policies during the formative stage of the region's new administrative apparatus.

The BARMM, like the rest of the Philippines, has been developing strategies to recover faster from the COVID-19 pandemic and address the substantial disruptions it caused. As part of the Bangsamoro Response and Recovery Plan (BRRP) on COVID-19 (2020-2022), the Bangsamoro government outlined critical strategies, including how the government will mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, facilitate adaptation to a new normal, and support gradual socioeconomic recovery over the three years.

As stated in the BRRP, the Bangsamoro government will encourage a whole-of-government approach as well as the convergence of efforts in the implementation of priority PPAs such as intensification of health-care services, strengthening social protection mechanisms, improving livelihood support, sustaining the food supply-chain, ensuring continuity of educational opportunities, and improving the region's adaptive capacity to the current crisis, among others.

### Prospects

#### Significant improvements in education and health performance

Access to education and health services is expected to improve significantly due to greater public investments in education and health and improved capacities of the MBHTE, MOH, and LGUs. Improved research capacities, particularly the use of data, will result in the deliberate targeting of unserved and underserved communities.

#### Declining trend in poverty

Two years have passed since COVID-19 swept the globe, but the pandemic is by no means over. COVID-19 is as much a social and economic crisis as it is a health crisis, yet one thing is certain: it has affected all segments of society with the most severe consequences falling on the marginalized and vulnerable. As we have witnessed, COVID-19 has disproportionately affected the poor and vulnerable who have borne the brunt of the damage.

Our government's efforts to combat poverty have been hampered by COVID-19. According to a study conducted by the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), the pandemic would make it more difficult for the Philippines to reduce poverty and return to its pre-pandemic growth path. But despite this setback, the implementation of poverty alleviation programs has continued, and our government has been ensuring that services were delivered to the basic sectors during the pandemic.

In the case of BARMM, poverty reduction is the most important success story in the region. All of the BARMM government's efforts to reduce poverty are starting to bear fruit, despite the challenges that have been brought about by the region's transition, as well as the pandemic's compounded effects. It is remarkable to note that the BARMM has seen a huge decrease in poverty incidence over the last three years, from 54.20 percent in 2018 to 29.8 percent in 2021. Thus, the region recorded the greatest percentage drop among the regions in the Philippines.

In spite of achieving this significant milestone, BARMM still has the highest poverty incidence among the regions in the country. This entails that the region must scale-up its efforts to ensure that anti-poverty programs and interventions are holistic by means of integrating the necessary social protection components especially for those in need.

As BARMM moves forward with programs meant to hasten its socioeconomic recovery and maintain progress in poverty reduction and economic growth, it must mobilize a larger, whole-of-government and whole-of-society effort to ensure long-term economic growth, lasting peace, and sustainable development in the Bangsamoro.

#### Threats of violent extremism and land conflict remain a challenge but with stronger local government response and support

Violent extremism will continue to be a threat as long as the pernicious shadow economies remain significant in selected localities. However, it is expected that there will be local government response and support as a result of continuing institutional strengthening of the LGUs.

Land conflict is expected to continuously persist in the region in the next few years given the lack of enabling laws in terms of land governance. Thus, a stronger government support should be realized to resolve land conflicts.

#### Social protection will be efficiently and adequately delivered to internally displaced and marginalized communities

The continuing improvement of systems in the BARMM MOAs and the LGUs will result in the efficient and adequate provision of social protection to marginalized communities and internally displaced persons, particularly during emergencies. Technology will grow rapidly in the next few years, making it cheaper and more accessible to state actors and organizations for disaster response and recovery.

#### Madaris education will be strengthened and promoted in the BARMM

The importance of Madaris education in BARMM cannot be overstated. It is particularly important in the context of the Bangsamoro, which is a region that is in a country with a non-Muslim majority. Madaris education plays a vital role in preserving the Islamic faith and culture.

The passage of the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act (BAA) No. 18, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Education Code, is hoped to pave way for a Bangsamoro educational system that is relevant and responsive to the needs, ideals, and aspirations of the Bangsamoro people. More importantly, this Code is seen to strengthen the Madaris system.

As more traditional schools/Madrasahs get accredited and, in the process, getting more government support, Madaris education will be a potent pathway for accessing education in the BARMM. Therefore, there is a need for the Bangsamoro government to focus its efforts on adopting a curriculum for Madaris that is relevant and responsive to the needs and context of the Bangsamoro people.

## Technological

### Trends

#### Demand for high-quality digital connectivity

BARMM continues to face digital connectivity challenges, with inadequate information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure being one of the causes. There is a digital divide in terms of ICT access and utilization. Based on the results of the 2019 National ICT Survey, BARMM has the highest percentage of households without digital access and largest percentage of people who are not using computers among the regions in the Philippines recorded at 95.5 percent and 91.5 percent, respectively.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought this issue to the forefront by demonstrating the critical importance of digital connectivity in dealing with a crisis. The pandemic has revealed the realities that underpin our economies; limited internet connectivity means missing out on employment opportunities, education, health care, public services, as well as the power of information and digital transformation. This is particularly glaring in BARMM especially among the underprivileged and marginalized populations who lack access to computers and the internet.

### Prospects

#### Technology as a potent instrument to reduce inequity and address development challenges in BARMM

Technology is projected to be cheaper and more accessible in the next few years. It can be utilized to enhance the capability of BARMM MOAs to respond to disaster-stricken communities in an adequate and timely manner. Provision of social protection will also be rationalized through better targeting in the use of data and technology. A more important advantage of technology is the ability to leverage it to promote transparent and accountable governance.

On the economic empowerment of the poor and vulnerable sectors, technology can be used to aid farmers and fisherfolks to have better access to market information and in promoting resilient farming. With better access to technology, MSMEs can develop more competitive products and promote them more effectively. Players in the industry will also have the opportunity to access international markets and will have better access to innovations through technology.

In order to harness the potential of technology, BARMM must prioritize and increase budgetary support for digital infrastructure, including ICT, as well as research and innovation. Further, it is important to provide equal access to technology throughout BARMM, particularly to the geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas (GIDA).

#### E-Governance for efficient and effective service delivery

The Bangsamoro government focuses on e-governance in order to improve service delivery. As part of its efforts to strengthen local governance in the region, the Bangsamoro government is currently developing an innovative, citizen-centric service delivery system that fosters innovation. This entails enabling citizens to make use of the benefits of digital transformation via the application of technology for greater access to services and information. Hence, efforts have been focused on improving digital connectivity throughout the Bangsamoro region with the aim of bolstering e-governance.

## Legal

### Prospects

#### The passage of the remaining priority codes

The BTA strives to fast track the passage of priority codes that will aid in the overall development of BARMM. The delay in the passage of priority codes and other significant legislations is believed to have impeded the full realization of some development goals of the region. For instance, revenue generation in the region is a major development concern because of the delay in the passage of necessary legislation. Therefore, the BTA must enact the remaining priority codes, such as electoral, local governance, revenue, and indigenous peoples' rights before the end of the extended transition period.

#### Setting a legislative and policy agenda

For the next six years, it will be crucial for BARMM to set a legislative and policy agenda that will shape relevant and responsive policies and programmatic outcomes, both in the medium-term and in the long-term. As an important precursor to setting up this agenda, it would be necessary to ensure meaningful participation of all relevant stakeholders, particularly those from marginalized and disadvantaged communities, to achieve results that are inclusive and holistic. Additionally, the BARMM must ramp up its efforts to leverage research and evidence-based data to set the legislative and policy agenda for the BARMM.

## Environmental

### Trends

#### Climate change and increasing threat of environmental degradation

BARMM is vulnerable to natural disasters and effects of climate change. It has some of the highest risk indicators in the Philippines. BARMM's geographical location makes it vulnerable to natural disasters. Many of the areas in the region are situated in low lying areas and surrounded by water ways. The region's three mainland provinces, namely, the Maguindanao del Sur, Maguindanao del Norte, and Lanao del Sur are more susceptible to disasters like flooding and landslides.

Aside from this, illegal activities like illegal logging and deforestation have also put the region at risk, noting that the region has a total forest cover of 299,839 hectares. Many of the areas in the region have become more exposed to disaster as their protection is taken off due to illegal activities. Further, rapid commercialization and urbanization of many areas in the region has put it more at risk to disasters due to lack of proper planning and conversion of rivers, forest, and agricultural lands to commercial areas.

Climate change has exacerbated the effects of natural disaster. Among the effects of climate change is rising levels of water, rising temperature, and severe weather events. Rising level of water tide has caused frequent sea surge in the island provinces and the increase in water level causes submersion in some areas of the island provinces in the region. Also, the rising temperature has caused severe drought while severe weather events have caused frequent flooding and flood-induced landslides.

The recent onslaught of Typhoon Paeng (Nalgae) has drawn attention to the fact that typhoons and other natural disasters are becoming stronger due to climate change, resulting in more damages and casualties even in regions that are far from the eye of the typhoon, as in the case of BARMM.

### Prospects

#### Taking an all-of-government and all-of-society approach to CCA and DRRM

Taking into account the context of BARMM, which involves a confluence of man-made and natural disasters, an approach encompassing inter/intra-governmental and multi-sectoral integration shall be pursued. The Bangsamoro government shall also continue to leverage on the capacities of the CSOs to reinforce peacebuilding initiatives. Engaging and empowering CSOs is always central to the BARMM government's strategy in laying the groundwork for a peaceful transition.

Therefore, BARMM's disaster risk reduction and management and climate change adaptation (DRRM-CCA) should espouse a whole-of-government and a whole-of-society approach that underpins effective coordination and convergence of efforts among BARMM MOAs, as well as between the national government and the regional government.

#### Better monitoring, regulation, and supervision in managing environmental assets

The presence of enabling policies and the continuing improvement of systems using data, technology and innovation will equip key agencies such as the MENRE and the concerned LGUs to efficiently and effectively monitor and manage the utilization of environmental assets.

#### Strengthening BARMM's capacity to improve community resilience

The Bangsamoro government plays a critical role in the ability of the communities to recover from the ill-effects of climate change and human-induced shocks through prevention and mitigation, disaster preparedness, and improved disaster response, recovery, and rehabilitation. As the Bangsamoro government improves its systems and as communities gain better access to critical information, a manageable loss in time of emergencies is anticipated.

# Chapter 3: Bangsamoro Spatial Strategy

The Bangsamoro Spatial Strategy (BSS) sets the long-term direction for the development in the BARMM. This chapter introduces the BARMM's vast comparative advantages and potentials that determine the functional roles of its provinces, capital city, and special geographic area that will support and sustain economic development in the region. These functional roles shall support the expansion and emergence of new economies that will sustain economic growth and development across the region.

## Introduction

RA 11054 establishes the BARMM which is composed of the provinces of Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi; and the cities of Marawi, Lamitan, and Cotabato. In addition, 63 barangays from the province of North Cotabato, which is referred to as the Special Geographic Area (SGA), are also included in its territory.

With the ratification of RA 11550 through a plebiscite held on September 17, 2022, the province of Maguindanao is now divided into two: Maguindanao del Norte and Maguindanao del Sur.

## BARMM Profile

*   4,944,800 Million Population (Source: PSA Census, 2020)
*   32,953.01 sq.km. Land Area (Source: NAMRIA)
*   6 Provinces
*   3 Cities
*   116 Municipalities
*   2,590 Barangays

BARMM is the largest region in the Philippines in terms of land area with a total of 32,953.01 sq.km. It covers the 10.98 percent of the total land area of the Philippines which is 300,000 sq.km. It is composed of 6 provinces, 3 cities (1 independent component and 2 component cities), 116 municipalities, and 2,590 barangays. The city of Isabela, despite being part of Basilan, is not under the administrative jurisdiction of the region. Likewise, the SGA is also part of the BARMM as a result of the plebiscite conducted to ratify the BOL.

### Table 3.1 BARMM Land Area, 2018

## Regional Spatial Strategy

Agglomeration, Connectivity, and Vulnerability Reduction are the three key spatial strategy principles that are vital in the identification of the overall spatial strategy of the BARMM and basis for the assessment of the region's growth centers and functional roles.

### Agglomeration

Agglomeration in BARMM is mainly demonstrated by the hierarchy of settlements which reflects the pattern or structure of settlements laid down in the region. The spatial arrangement and distribution of existing settlement strata or services was based primarily on population size, function, degree of urbanization, and presence of economic and social services. In essence, the larger the population of a settlement, the larger the scale of activities, therefore, the greater opportunities for division of labor and specialization.

### Table 3.4 Hierarchy of Networks of Settlements

| Level | Role | Indicator Functions | Population |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Regional Growth Center | Major center that provides services to national and international companies. | Presence of international port, airport, commerce | 1,200,000 and above |
| Sub-regional Growth Center | Provide support services that serve beyond local boundaries | Presence of national airport, level 3 hospital, commerce, and national developers | 120,000 - 1,200,000 |
| Provincial center | Provincial services and administration | Presence of tertiary level education, level 2 hospital, commercial banks, commerce residential subdivision, auto repair shop, service forwarders, cable | 50,000 - 120,000 |
| Local center | Rural and agricultural services | Presence of food retail, secondary school, primary health care, bus terminal, lodging inn | 50,000 and below |

The urban centers in the BARMM have been classified as regional centers, sub-regional centers, provincial centers, and local centers.

### Table 3.5 BARMM Existing Network of Settlements

| Hierarchy | City and Municipality |
| :--- | :--- |
| Regional Center | Cotabato City* |
| Sub-regional Center | Marawi City, Lamitan*, Jolo*, Datu Odin Sinsuat*, Bongao*, Buluan* |
| Provincial Center | Parang, Upi, Wao, Malabang, Sultan Kudarat, Indanan, Maimbung, Parang, Siasi, Talipao. |
| Local Center | **Basilan:** Lantawan, Maluso, Sumisip, Tipo-Tipo, Tuburan, Akbar, Al-Barka, Hadji Mohammad Ajul, Ungkaya Pukan, Hadji Muhtamad, Tabuan-Lasa, **Maguindanao:** Ampatuan, Buldon, Datu Paglas, Datu Piang, Shariff Aguak, Matanog, Pagalungan, Kabuntalan, Talayan, South Upi, Barira, General Salipada K. Pendatun, Mamasapano, Pagagawan, Sultan Mastura, Datu Saudi Ampatuan, Datu Abdullah Sangki, Rajah Buayan, Datu Blah T. Sinsuat, Datu Anggal Midtimbang, Mangudadatu, Pandag, Northern Kabuntalan, Datu Hoffer Ampatuan, Shariff Saydona Mustapha. **Sulu:** Kalingalan Caluang, Luuk, Hadji Panglima Tahil, Old Panamao, Pangutaran, Tongkil, Panglima Estino, Lugus, Pandami, Omar. **Tawi-Tawi:** Panglima Sugala, Mapun, Simunul, Sitangkai, South Ubian, Tandubas, Languyan, Sapa-Sapa, Sibutu. **Lanao del Sur:** Balabagan, Balindong, Bayang, Binidayan, Bubong, Ganassi, Lumba-Bayabao, Madalum, Malabang, Marantao, Masiu, Piagapo, Poona Bayabao, Saguiaran, Tamparan, Taraka, Marogong, Maguing |

*Note: Did not meet the population criteria but considered regional and sub-regional centers because of the presence of services, and income class.*

In the existing hierarchy of settlements, Cotabato City serves as BARMM's Regional Center based on presence of services, and income class. Being one of the functional urban centers with high access to basic facilities and services, Cotabato City shall serve as the financial and commercial hub. It connects to and serves as service center for provincial and local centers on major services such as financial, commercial, education, and health services as the current seat of the Bangsamoro government. Hence, it plays a critical role in linking strategic areas and business centers that are critical to trade and investments.

In 2050, there are 25 municipalities that will be elevated to sub-regional centers and 73 municipalities for provincial centers in terms of projected population as reflected in Table 3.6. All other municipalities in the region will play their role as local centers of their respective provinces.

Meanwhile, the proposed sub-regional centers will provide the services for its nearby provincial centers towards the realization of its functional roles as provided in Table 3.6.

### Table 3.6 BARMM Hierarchy of Settlements Based on Population Projection, 2050

| Province | Sub-Regional Center | Provincial Center | Local Center |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Maguindanao del Norte** | Datu Odin Sinsuat, Parang, Sultan Kudarat, Upi | Buldon, Matanog, Kabuntalan, Barira, Sultan Mastura, Datu Blah T. Sinsuat, Northern Kabuntalan | All other areas |
| **Maguindanao del Sur** | Buluan | Ampatuan, Datu Paglas, Talayan, Mangudadatu, Pandag, Guindulungan, Datu Saudi Ampatuan, Datu Abdullah Sangki, Rajah Buayan, Datu Anggal Midtimbang, Datu Hoffer Ampatuan, South Upi, Shariff Saydona Mustapha, Pagagawan, General Salipada K. Pendatun, Mamasapano, Sultan sa Barongis, Shariff Aguak, Datu Piang | All other areas |
| **Lanao del Sur** | Marawi, Wao, Malabang, Lumba-Bayabao | Balindong, Marantao, Piagapo, Saguiaran, Bacolod-Kalawi, Balabagan, Bayang, Binidayan, Bubong, Butig, Ganassi, Kapai, Lumbatan, Madalum, Madamba, Masiu, Tamparan, Taraka, Tugaya, Marogong, Maguing, Kapatagan | All other areas |
| **Basilan** | Hadji Mohammad Ajul, Lamitan | Maluso, Sumisip, Lantawan, Tipo-Tipo, Tuburan, Akbar, Al-Barka, Ungkaya Pukan, Hadji Muhtamad, Tabuan-Lasa | All other areas |
| **Sulu** | Jolo, Patikul, Talipao, Indanan, Kalingan Caluang, Luuk, Maimbang, Old Panamao, Parang, Siasi | Pata, Tapul, Lugus, Pandami, Omar, Pangutaran, Tongkil, Panglima Estino | All other areas |
| **Tawi-Tawi** | Bongao, Sitangkai, Languyan, Mapun, Sapa-Sapa, Sibutu, Simunul | Panglima Sugala, South Ubian, Tandubas | All other areas |

## Vulnerability Reduction

Vulnerability reduction is a principle of spatial strategy that includes the security and protection of agglomerated and connected infrastructure against threats from man-made and natural disasters. It considers the climate change projections and threats of hydrometeorological and geologic hazard, and other events including public health emergencies with increasing initiatives on disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation.

### Hydrometeorological Hazards

The BARMM has become more susceptible to climate change and disasters. This is reflected in their high exposure and vulnerability to floods and droughts. Natural disasters have become more frequent and damaging. Therefore, typhoons and droughts caused displacement, loss of livelihood, disruption of agricultural activities, and food insecurity.

Frequent flooding in low-lying areas, especially in Cotabato City, Maguindanao, and Lanao del Sur, is caused by persistent rainfall in the BARMM and Northern Mindanao that affects large numbers of communities in the region. In addition, BARMM is affected by storm surges particularly in Maguindanao, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi.

Recently, the diminishing area of forest cover, rain-induced landslides, and soil erosions are experienced in the provinces of Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Basilan, and Sulu.

### Geological Hazards

There are two trenches that engulf the region causing the occurrence of earthquakes and tsunamis. Epicenters are located around faults and trenches. Sulu Trench is on the west side of the island provinces of the region and the Cotabato Trench is located in the southwestern coast of the mainland area of the region.

### Volcanic Hazards

The region has two dormant stratovolcanoes, namely, Mt. Ragang and Mt. Makaturing. Both are located in the province of Lanao del Sur. The Mt. Ragang is the 7th highest volcano in the country and recorded its last eruption in 1916 while Mt. Makaturing erupted in 1882.
