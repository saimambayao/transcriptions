**AN ACT STRENGTHENING THE MADARIS EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IN THE BANGSAMORO REGION AND PROVIDING ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE MADARIS EDUCATION FUND ASSISTANCE, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Thousands of students in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region (or Philippines) receive some or all of their formal education in a madrasah or madaris, plural for madrasah. In Madaris, Muslims are provided with religious foundations in Qur'anic recitations and Islamic values. The light of *Īmān* (faith) first permeates in the heart of the Muslim in this environment. For some Muslims, the madrasah is the only formal education afforded to them; for others, it is supplementary to secular basic education provided in primary and secondary schools.

Education is a core of human resource development, it aims to instill young people's values and culture to mold their identity as better citizens. In fact, the Constitution explicitly states that the system of education to be established, maintained and supported should be relevant to the needs of the people and society (Sec. 2(1), Art. XIV), hence it has also responsibility to strengthen and develop our Madrasah education system in Bangsamoro Autonomous Region and other Muslim-populated regions in the archipelago.

The Madrasah has been officially streamlined into the Philippine Education system almost two (2) decades ago, and the Department of Education issued Policy Guidelines on Madrasah Education in the K to 12 Basic Education Program under DO 41, series of 2017. However, up to date, many private Madaris still are located in poor communities and are woefully ill-equipped in terms of school facilities, books, teaching/learning devices, and some teachers are not afforded with consistent compensation salary. Many poor Muslim students attend Madrasah because it is near their home, and there is little incentive to attend the local government schools.

Hence, it is imperative that all Madaris in this region be strengthened by providing additional educational funds which shall play an important factor in the operational improvement of its educational quality. With more funds, Madaris will be able to expand their curriculum and train their teachers, and eventually be pressured to integrate basic subjects into the curriculum.

Further, we in the government should take serious steps in considering Madrasah education as an important part of education system not just a source of basic Islamic education but a source of inspiration for real world advancements.

And lastly, we need a proper funding system to be implemented to address their financial needs so that the standards of these institutions shall be mainstreamed into the modern world.

Based from the foregoing, the approval of this bill is urgently requested.
