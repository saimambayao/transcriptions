**AN ACT CREATING THE BANGSAMORO DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, DEFINING ITS POWERS AND FUNCTIONS, PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Bangsamoro Government fought in the struggle because of the unaddressed economic and social problems of the Bangsamoro. There is a need to address this concern by way of providing employment and livelihood opportunities that can only be brought about by investments. An accelerated promotion of economic and social development of the Bangsamoro territories is needed, and we should be cognizant of the vital role of the private sector and the local government units in this.

There is a pressing need to enhance the inflow of private capital and broaden the ownership base to fund development initiatives, including that of infrastructure facilities. The best way to pursue the inflow of private capital while ensuring fair and non-discriminatory treatment of public and private sector entities in the process of development, is to create a development corporation.

We not only establish a strong and purely independent regulatory body and system to ensure consumer protection and enhance the competitive operation the investment market but also minimize the financial risk exposure of the Bangsamoro Government at the same time.

In view of the foregoing, the immediate passage of the bill is earnestly sought.
