**AN ACT UPGRADING THE EXISTING SOUTH UPI MUNICIPAL HOSPITAL IN MAGUINDANAO FROM TEN (10) BED INTO FIFTY (50) BED CAPACITY AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

For 30 years, the South Upi Municipal Hospital has been serving the people of South Upi and the nearby barangays of Upi, Maguindanao and Lebak, Sultan Kudarat Province. However, since 1992 and until now, the hospital’s Authorized Bed Capacity is only 10 beds with its corresponding staff complement and budgetary allocation.

During the period 2017 to 2021, the Bed Occupancy Rate (BOR) of the South Upi Municipal Hospital continues to increase at 136% to 362%. As prescribed by the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA), the hospital bed to population ratio should be one (1) hospital bed per 1,000 population. In the case of South Upi, the ideal number of beds should be 50 given its projected population of 49,230 in 2022.

More than the long years of service provided by the South Upi Municipal Hospital, it has enjoyed the continued patronage of the surrounding and nearby communities. Moreover, the hospital’s personnel effectively communicate and have fostered amiable relations with the people in the communities including indigenous peoples. In fact, the hospital staff are able to communicate using the Teduray dialect which is critically important considering that more than seventy percent (70%) of the hospital’s patients are from the Teduray tribe.

Upon the recommendation of ESTER S. PETILO MD., FPOGS the Medical Officer V and Chief of Hospital of SUMH, this draft bill proposes to upgrade the existing South Upi Municipal Hospital of Maguindanao del Sur from a ten (10) bed to a fifty (50) bed-capacity hospital. It also proposes to provide the necessary hospital space to accommodate the additional beds, equip the hospital with up-to-date medical and office equipment and facilities, and correspondingly increase the staff complement.

When passed into law, this bill will fulfil the mandate of the Bangsamoro Government to promote and protect the rights of indigenous peoples to access life-saving health services. It shall bring to life the Bangsamoro Government’s policy of providing sufficient, appropriate, accessible and affordable health service. The passage of this bill is strongly encouraged to realise the Bangsamoro Government’s commitment the peoples in the Bangsamoro and indigenous peoples, so that no one is left behind.

In this connection please allow me to file this bill ____ as BTA Parliament Bill for the benefit of our people in the Municipality of South Upi Province of Maguindanao Del Sur. Fiyo Bagi Meuyag.
