**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Republic Act No. 11054, the “Organic Law for Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao”, provides in Section 22 (1), Article IX thereof that: “The Bangsamoro Government shall adopt a policy on health that provides for a comprehensive and integrated health service delivery for its constituents. It shall establish by law a general hospital system to serve the health requirements of its people and ensure that the individual basic right to life shall be attainable through the prompt intervention of excellent and affordable medical services.”

Hospitals are one of the most important pillars of any society. It plays an increasingly important role in people’s lives; with great pollution levels and changing lifestyles, much more in this time of COVID-19 pandemic, more and more people are falling prey to diseases and requiring adequate medical care. Having no nearby hospitals within the locality would mean a lot of hassle for the patient and their families to look for a proper specialist to diagnose particular illness and its treatment.

Datu Piang is a 2nd class municipality in the Province of Maguindanao. It is among the first municipalities of the old Cotabato Province. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 28,380 people. However, less attention must have been given to them by the prior government authorities concerning health facilities. Currently, a private infirmary, Abpi Samama Medical Lying in Clinic and Hospital is the one catering the needs of its sick constituents, treating the injured and handling outbreaks of disease. The only government facility established in the municipality is the Datu Piang Rural Health Unit.

Government hospitals are more ideal and well encouraged than private hospitals in many aspects particularly in the availability of medical specialists and other medical professionals; the efficiency of facilities and technology that only a government hospital can provide.

Bangsamoro people are more likely to be satisfied if at any given point of time, no patient will ever go unattended in an adequately equipped hospital. This is an opportune time for the Bangsamoro Government to provide whatever necessities its constituents may need for the development and progress of its municipalities.

Hence the immediate passage of this bill is hereby earnestly sought.
