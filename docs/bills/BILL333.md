*Be it enacted by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority assembled*

**SEC. 1. Short Title.** – This Act shall be known as the “Bangsamoro Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Act”.

**SEC. 2. Declaration of Policy.** – Pursuant to the 1987 Philippine Constitution mandating the establishment of an autonomous region in Muslim Mindanao for peoples with common and distinctive historical and cultural heritage, economic and social structures, and other relevant characteristics, it is hereby declared the policy of the Bangsamoro to pursue lasting peace and development in the region through the implementation of plans and programs bilaterally agreed upon, between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GPH) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) as well as the Moro National Liberation Front, as part of the Bangsamoro peace process. Toward this end, the Bangsamoro Government, working within its jurisdiction and authority and without prejudice to the obligations of the national government, shall operationalize the provisions on transitional justice and reconciliation in the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB) and Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) to contribute to addressing the legitimate grievances, human rights violations, and marginalization through land dispossession, and correct the historical injustices suffered by the Bangsamoro people and other indigenous peoples in the region.

**SEC. 3. Definition of Terms.** – As used in this Act, the following terms will be taken to mean as:

a. *Transitional justice and reconciliation* is the full range of processes and mechanisms associated with a society’s attempt to come to terms with a past of violent conflict characterized by a legacy of large-scale repression, human rights violation, and other abuses, with the end view of ensuring accountability, serving justice, and achieving reconciliation. These may include both judicial and non-judicial mechanisms, with or without international involvement, such as individual prosecutions, reparations, truth-seeking, institutional reform, vetting and dismissals, or a combination thereof.

b. *Dealing with the past* is a framework of conflict transformation, for societies undergoing political and social transitions following a past of gross human rights violations, that is centered on the **right to know** or truth-seeking, **right to justice** or accountability, **right to reparations** or socio-economic justice, and **guarantee of non-recurrence** or institutional reforms that dismantle impunity and strengthen the rule of law.

c. *Legitimate grievances* are those social, economic, political, cultural, and other forms of harm suffered, collectively or individually, by the Bangsamoro people and other indigenous peoples in the region throughout the different points of their history as a result of systematic and wide-scale state-sponsored or state-sanctioned commission of gross human rights violation, repression, subjugation, discrimination, and other forms of injustices as part of the imposition of a monolithic Filipino identity and Philippine State, and which led to the marginalization of the peoples in their own homeland.

d. *Human rights violations* are transgressions, whether state-sponsored or -sanctioned or independently committed by non-state actors, of internationally and constitutionally recognized rights that are intrinsic to every human being and encompass the aspects of their civil, political, economic, social, and cultural lives.

e. *Marginalization through land dispossession* is the process by which formal and informal state policies favored non-native inhabitants of Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago to the disadvantage of its native inhabitants and which led to the massive displacement and loss of lands of the latter.

f. *Historical injustices* are the series of wrongdoings committed or sanctioned by different authorities or institutions – whether colonial or post-colonial, state or non-state – that caused experienced, perceived, or imagined harm to the Bangsamoro people and other indigenous peoples in the region repeatedly over time, and which were not properly addressed.

g. *The Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB)* is the peace pact forged between the GPH and the MILF, through their respective negotiating panels, which agreement recognizes the justness and legitimacy of the cause of the Bangsamoro people and provides for the negotiated political settlement of the decades-long armed conflict affecting them.

h. *The Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC)* is the body provided in the CAB to undertake a study and recommend to the negotiating panels of the GPH and MILF the appropriate mechanisms to address the legitimate grievances of the Bangsamoro people, correct historical injustices, and address human rights violations and marginalization through land dispossession, towards healing and reconciliation.

**SEC. 4. Statement of Goals and Objectives.** To carry out the policy outlined above, as informed by the guiding principles outlined in the preceding section, the Bangsamoro Government shall pursue the attainment of the following goals and objectives:

a. immediately take steps to operationalize the provisions of the CAB, guided by the report of the TJRC, and the BOL on transitional justice and reconciliation and initiate the comprehensive regional program therefor as described throughout this Act;

b. maximize the powers of the Bangsamoro Government towards acting on and, when proper, resolving the transitional justice and reconciliation issues of the Bangsamoro;

c. forge a mechanism for institutional coordination and the integration of the comprehensive regional program with the national counterpart, as soon as the latter is constituted or formed;

d. ensure that the future generations of the peoples within and outside the Bangsamoro are cognizant of the Bangsamoro history, struggle, and cause in their true essence and light; and,

e. foster an environment within the Bangsamoro that is conducive to unity and respect for diversity as a result of healing and reconciliation.

**SEC. 5. Bangsamoro Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Program.** – There shall be a comprehensive regional program on transitional justice and reconciliation to be called the Bangsamoro Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Program, hereinafter “the Program,” that will, as much as practicable and to the maximum extent allowed by the authorities and jurisdiction of the Bangsamoro Government under the Constitution and the BOL, serve as the regional mechanism to aid in addressing the legitimate grievances, correcting historical injustices, redressing human rights violations, and setting to right the marginalization through land dispossession suffered by the Bangsamoro people and other indigenous peoples in the region, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the CAB.

The Program shall build on the recommendations of the TJRC in their 2016 report and shall form part of but not supplant the national program for transitional justice and reconciliation referred to in the CAB. *Provided, That*, consistent with the TJRC report, the Program shall be guided by the *dealing with the past* framework and shall ensure that the right to know, right to justice, right to reparations, and the guarantee of non-recurrence shall be the hallmarks of the policies, programs, and initiatives thereunder, ultimately towards healing the wounds of conflict and realizing reconciliation for all.

**SEC. 6. Guiding Principles.** The Program shall be designed and implemented in accordance with the following principles:

a. *Human rights-based.* The Program shall be guided by the human rights principles of universality, indivisibility, equality and non-discrimination, participation, and accountability and shall focus on developing at the individual, community, and institutional levels the capacities of the duty-bearers to meet their obligations and the rights-holders to claim their rights.

b. *Victim-centered.* The Program shall place, at the forefront of all efforts and policies thereunder, the rights and dignity of the victims or survivors, their well-being and safety, and meeting their needs and wishes. As such, the Program shall ensure that the victims or survivors are protected from harm, that no further harm is inflicted upon them as a result of the Program, and that all is done to help the victims or survivors as regards issues and challenges affecting them that have come to light in the course of the implementation of the Program.

c. *Future-oriented.* The attainment of the objectives of the Program shall be done in a manner that ensures non-recurrence, introduces institutional reforms, builds trust and fosters harmony, and, as far as practicable, avoids breeding and rekindling hatred and animosities but focuses on healing and reconciliation among peoples and communities, without compromising on the full recognition and formal documentation of the events of the past.

d. *Sensitive to Bangsamoro and Filipino contexts.* The Program shall prioritize the use of indigenous methodologies and processes for knowledge gathering, conflict resolution, and healing and reconciliation, and shall ensure recognition and respect for the cultural and religious sensibilities of the Bangsamoro and other indigenous communities.

e. *People-owned.* The Program shall employ the bottom-up approach in policy- and decision-making, allowing for the active participation of the communities, doing away with the usual formalities, when necessary, thereby ensuring that the accomplishments of the Program emanate and enjoy wide acceptance from the stakeholders.

f. *Respects diversity.* The Program shall include and involve peoples from different communities and shall ensure that the distinctiveness of each group informs the policies, plans, and projects thereof.

g. *Promotes meaningful participation of women.* The Program shall ensure the impactful participation of women in all levels of decision and policy-making as well as the implementation of the initiatives thereunder. As far as practicable, gender balance shall be reflected in the recruitment in the BTJRC, the engagement of its pool of consultants, and the identification of participants in all aspects of the Program.

**SEC. 7. Components of the Program.** The Program shall have five main components, to wit:

1. *Human rights violations* whereby transgressions of human rights committed against the Bangsamoro people and other indigenous peoples in the region from the American period up to contemporary times are properly documented, along with preparations for possible prosecution or claim for reparation, when appropriate. *Provided, That*, the violations to be covered under the Program are those that are emblematic and/or committed as a result of the purposive or unintentional imposition of a monolithic Filipino identity and Philippine State upon the Bangsamoro people and other indigenous peoples in the region

2. *Land dispossession* whereby the evolution of land policies and the pattern of land dispossession from the Treaty of Paris in 1898 up to modern times is mapped;

3. *History, Memory, and Truth* whereby a complete picture of the earliest recorded history of the Bangsamoro people and other indigenous peoples in the region as well as the historical injustices committed against them, from the pre-colonial until the contemporary times, is established to the fullest extent possible, making full disclosure of the facts relating to or associated with such injustices and reporting the same to the public;

4. *Institutional reform* whereby policy recommendations that would address the issues raised under the first three components and bring reconciliation and non-recurrence are offered and submitted to the appropriate authorities, within and outside BARMM; and

5. *Stakeholders' involvement* whereby a platform is provided to engage the stakeholders, especially those from the civil society, throughout the lifetime of the Program.

**SEC. 8. Bangsamoro Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Commission.** – There is hereby created an independent Bangsamoro Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Commission, hereinafter “BTJRC”.
