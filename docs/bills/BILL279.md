**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Chronic Kidney Disease or Chronic Renal Disease (CKD) is a condition characterized by a gradual loss of kidney function.¹ It is a serious health problem affecting many Filipinos. In 2020, there were close to 35,000 Filipinos who underwent dialysis and treatment for kidney disease.²

Unfortunately, aside from its contribution to mortality, the growing burden of CKD is also illustrated by its associated financial costs. One of the options for a patient with end-stage kidney disease is Hemodialysis which is usually done about three sessions a week. In the Philippines, the cost of dialysis ranges from Php 2,000 to Php 7,000 or more per session. This means that a CKD patient will need around Php 6,000 to Php 21,000 per week. This high cost of CKD treatment is beyond affordable for ordinary patients.

In June 2022, the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) expanded the PhilHealth coverage for members undergoing hemodialysis from 90 to 156 sessions per year.³ This is a significant government initiative to save the lives of CKD patients. However, there is still a major challenge in the accessibility and affordability of CKD treatment due to the enormous number of patients who require dialysis treatment and the limited dialysis treatment facilities.

For CKD patients from BARMM, especially those from remote rural areas, traveling to get treatment is not only difficult but also a huge financial strain. Barriers to healthcare like this limit the ability of patients to obtain the care they need.

The accessibility and affordability of dialysis treatment are crucial considerations for public health, and the Bangsamoro Government plays a significant role in ensuring that such essential healthcare services are available to its citizens.

This measure seeks to require all BARMM provincial hospitals to set up, operate and maintain a dialysis unit in their respective hospital. Considering the constraints on the regional government’s budget, this representation deems more practical and feasible to begin requiring the establishment of dialysis units or wards at the provincial level.

In view of the foregoing, the immediate passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
