**AN ACT**
**REQUIRING ALL HOSPITALS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION TO ESTABLISH A DIALYSIS UNIT, AND PROVIDE FREE DIALYSIS SERVICES TO INDIGENT PATIENTS**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

It is the declared policy of the Bangsamoro government to protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them.

The 2019 Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study has shown that in the Philippines, Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is the 4th leading cause of death in the country. Relative to this, the Philippine Renal Disease Registry (PRDR) reveals that from 2006 to 2016, the leading cause of End-Stage Kidney Disease in the country is secondary to complications of diabetes, hypertension, and chronic glomerulonephritis.

Considering the large number of patients who need to undergo dialysis treatment regularly, dialysis treatment centers should not only be accessible to these patients but should also be affordable.

Unfortunately, most of the kidney patients have to travel to nearby towns and cities to be able to get treatment. In the BARMM, due to its geographic landscape, patients experience difficulty in accessing safe and quality health facilities, more so in geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas. Most rural health units are physically dilapidated, worn out, and under-equipped. Most facilities have no operational resources. Other health facilities are located far from the communities, which limits people’s access to basic health services.

This situation is further exacerbated by the cost of dialysis treatments. Kidney patients normally have to undergo dialysis treatment two to three times a week, with one treatment costing around Php 2,500. This means that a kidney patient has to spend around Php 5,000 to Php 7,500 per week to survive, to mention the cost of maintenance medicines that the patient has to take.

It is imperative for the regional government to respond to the needs of these communities by ensuring seamless delivery of health goods and services. This bill mandates the establishment of dialysis centers in all government hospitals in the region to ensure that all kidney patients can easily access these centers for their treatment without traveling far. This measure also recognizes the financial burden faced by dialysis patients and mandates that indigents shall be given free treatments in these centers.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
