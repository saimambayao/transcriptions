**AN ACT ESTABLISHING A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK FOR ACKNOWLEDGING AND REWARDING OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE AMONG BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, THROUGH A POINTS-BASED SYSTEM, AND PROVIDING GUIDELINES FOR THE CONVERSION OF EARNED POINTS INTO LEAVE BENEFITS**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Government employees play a crucial role in the functioning and stability of society. They are the backbone of public administration, ensuring that essential services such as, but not limited to, healthcare, education, law enforcement, and social services are delivered efficiently and effectively to citizens. Their dedication and commitment to public service help maintain the infrastructure, uphold laws, and support community welfare.

Section 3, Article IX-B of the 1987 Philippine Constitution mandates the Civil Service Commission, as the central personnel agency of the Government to “establish a career service and adopt measures to promote morale, efficiency, integrity, responsiveness, progressiveness, and courtesy in the civil service. It shall strengthen the merit and reward system, integrate all human resources development programs for all levels and ranks, and institutionalize a climate conducive to public accountability. xx.”

Further, Section 2, Article V of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law, states:

**Section 2. *Powers of the Bangsamoro Government.*** - Subject to Section 20, Article X of the Constitution and this Organic Law, the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise its authority over the following matters without prejudice to the general supervision of the President of the Republic of the Philippines:

.. xx..

(i) Civil Service;

.. xx.

Further, Article 4, Chapter 1, Book 1 of the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 17 otherwise known as “The Bangsamoro Civil Service Code of 2021” provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall adopt measures to promote morale and the highest degree of responsibility, morality, integrity, loyalty, efficiency and professionalism in the civil service.

Employee morale refers to the overall attitude and satisfaction level of employees within a workplace. It encompasses their feelings of happiness, motivation, and engagement while on the job. When employees have positive morale, they are more likely to be productive, motivated, and committed to the company’s success. High morale leads to increased productivity, as happy employees tend to be more motivated and focused on their work. Additionally, employees with high morale are more likely to stay with their company long-term, reducing turnover costs and maintaining valuable knowledge and experience within the organization. High morale also leads to a positive work culture, which can improve collaboration, creativity, and overall job satisfaction.

This bill takes inspiration from the Philippine National Police (PNP) Circular No. 009, dated September 4, 2007, which provides guidelines for converting PNP medals to service credit and utilizing them as service leave. Here, PNP uniformed personnel are awarded service medals, ribbons, and badges, which can be converted to cash and leave credit incentives.

Introducing a points-based system, this bill allows employees to earn points based on their performance rating, which includes job performance, achievement of targets, participation in professional development, and exemplary conduct. Points accumulated over a specified period can be used as criteria for the performance rating given to each employee. If an employee receives at least two (2) consecutive very satisfactory ratings in their performance evaluations, they may be eligible to convert those ratings into additional leave days. This conversion provides a meaningful reward that acknowledges employees’ efforts and supports their work-life balance.

The points-based system promotes fairness and transparency in the evaluation and rewarding process, ensuring all employees have equal opportunities to be recognized for their contributions.

Enhancing employee motivation and morale can improve overall productivity and service delivery within the BARMM government. The structured reward system serves as motivation for employees to excel in their roles, contributing to the region’s sustainable development and effective governance.
