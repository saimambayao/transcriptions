**AN ACT**
**ESTABLISHING A LEVEL I GENERAL HOSPITAL IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF SITANGKAI, PROVINCE OF TAWI-TAWI, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Section 15, Article II of the 1987 Philippine Constitution declares that the State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people, and instill health consciousness among them. Furthermore, Section 11, Article XIII declares that the State shall adopt an integrated, and comprehensive approach to health development that shall endeavor to make essential goods, health, and other social services available to all the people at an affordable cost.

Likewise, Section 22, Article IX of the Bangsamoro Organic Law provides for the Bangsamoro Government to adopt a policy on health that provides for a comprehensive and integrated health service delivery for its constituents. In consonance with this policy, it is the mandate of the Bangsamoro Government to establish by law a general hospital system to serve the health requirements of its people, and ensure that the individual basic right to life shall be attainable through the prompt intervention of excellent and affordable medical services.

Pursuant to the aforementioned mandate, this bill proposes to establish a level I general hospital with fifty (50) beds in the Municipality of Sitangkai, Province of Tawi-Tawi. It normally takes about eight hours to travel from Sitangkai to reach Bongao, the capital town of Tawi Tawi, where the most accessible hospital – Datu Halun Sakilan Memorial Hospital is located. Patients from this 1st class municipality of Sitangkai have had to endure long sea journeys just to ensure their kin who are sick can get admitted into the hospital, or just to get a check-up. This burden on the people of Sitangkai must be eased.

Sitangkai is one of the most populated island municipalities in Tawi-Tawi. It is the southernmost part of the Philippines and is close to Malaysia and Indonesia. Providing medical services should be a priority for the Bangsamoro region – especially in Sitangkai.

The proponent of this measure seeks to have a general hospital created in this area to address the gaps in access to health care and to bring medical services closer to the people who live in Sitangkai.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
