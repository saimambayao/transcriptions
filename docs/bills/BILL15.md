**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) posted the top growth rate in 2021 among the regions for agricultural output by value according to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). BARMM’s value of production in agriculture and fisheries grew 7.2% at constant 2018 prices.¹ This achievement, however, is shared between the agricultural and fisheries output whereby the BARMM’s fisheries production comprises 28.6% of the total fisheries production in the country. With proper focus, prioritization, and programming, BARMM could maintain or even surpass its own agricultural output growth rate.

With the information given above, it is no surprise that the BARMM economy has been mainly driven consistently by agriculture. This economic providence can be attributable to the numerous abundant resources found in the different BARMM provinces which include seaweed and fisheries in Tawi-Tawi; coffee and fisheries in Sulu; rubber and sardines in Basilan; coconut, oil palm, banana, and corn flour in Maguindanao; and abaca, vegetable processing, and furniture-making in Lanao del Sur. The Maguindanao and Lanao provinces are likewise areas for the establishment of possible agro-industrial zones which can jointly produce livestock for the Halal meat industry that can be marketed to nearby Muslim-dominated countries.

With the vast agriculture, aquatic, and natural resources in the Bangsamoro, the continued focus and promotion of the region’s agricultural development is expected to redound to social and economic benefits. None other than the Bangsamoro Government is mandated by the Organic Law to formulate and implement policies and laws on agriculture which can be seen as key development strategies for the region to promote productivity measures and to provide support for small farmers, landholders, and marginal fisherfolk.

It is clear from the foregoing that agriculture should be a priority agenda of the autonomous region as it is one of the main sources of livelihood among the Bangsamoro. However, despite genuine efforts by the government, institutions, and non-government organizations, the agricultural sector has yet to evolve and truly enable farm workers to advance their gains and to further contribute to the overall development of the region.

Hence, this bill seeks to reorganize the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Agrarian Reform (MAFAR) by establishing the Ministry of Agriculture to focus on the distinct needs of the agricultural sector in the Bangsamoro Region. Under this proposed measure, the Ministry of Agriculture shall be the agency responsible for the promotion of agricultural development by providing the policy framework, public investments, and support services needed for domestic and export-oriented business enterprises.

The reorganization and creation of a separate ministry will institutionalize a workforce that is solely dedicated to the management of the region’s agricultural resources. By creating an independent and separate Ministry for Agriculture with the financial muscle to perform its mandate, this Act ultimately aims to enhance the welfare of all Bangsamoro farmers and improve agricultural productivity in the region.

Hence, this will be a significant step in order to better utilize and maximize the region’s agricultural resources as well as uphold the best interest of the farmers.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
