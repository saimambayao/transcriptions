**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

"We, the five million oppressed Bangsamoro people, wishing to free ourselves from the terror, oppression, and tyranny of Filipino colonialism which has caused us untold sufferings and miseries by criminality usurping our land, by threatening Islam through wholesale destruction and desecration of its places of worship and its Holy Book, and murdering our innocent brothers, sisters and folks in a genocidal campaign of terrifying magnitude... [hereby declare] the establishment of the Bangsamoro Republic."

In 1974, the decades-long struggle of the Bangsamoro people, as reflected in part by the above-quoted statement, was formally expressed to the Republic through a Manifesto signed by several young Bangsamoro revolutionaries whose names are etched in the halls of our history, and who are, up to this day, deliberated by historians, studied by the academe and chronicled in small circles across the region.

The ideals of these young men who initiated and fought for the moral, ethical, spiritual, and political transformation of the Bangsamoro region, and the change of the socio-economic and political order of our homeland were valued by many as the movement which led the fight for self-determination, autonomy and our fundamental right to the Bangsamoro ancestral homeland.

These young men were known as the *Top 90* and *Top 300* core members of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). The *Top 90* were MNLF fighters who had their training on guerrilla warfare in Pulao, Pangkor, Malaysia in 1969. It was in late 1972, after the declaration of Martial Law when the MNLF became a national liberation movement.

The Top 90 were composed of the different ethnolinguistic groups of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region who questioned the socio-political landscape in Mindanao and aimed to fight the social injustices towards the Bangsamoro people. In 1972, from the Top 90 core members of the MNLF, they expanded and recruited 300 young Muslims to join their group.

It is strange, however, that until today one cannot find a fitting monument in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region that would serve as a lasting memorial to these courageous men who fought to assert our rights and affirm our distinct historical identity and birthright from those who attempted to subdue it.

A memorial similar to the Iwo Jima monument or the Vietnam Memorial in Washington D.C., the Arch de Triomphe in Paris, or even in Bucharest, and the military statutes in London. We need a memorial that would be visited and revered by all, especially by the present and future generations.

Given the enormous commitment which the *Top 90* and *Top 300* core members have demonstrated repeatedly, it is appropriate to memorialize their valor and heroism. This bill seeks to provide an opportunity for all to honor and recognize the important contribution these people made to preserving our safety and well-being.

At present, elementary, secondary and college history books provide very limited information, if at all, about the adversities faced by these men and the courage they displayed. The *Top 90* and *300 Core Members*, the unsung champions of the Bangsamoro struggle, should be given proper recognition for the bravery they have manifested in continuously fighting for our rights.

Every Bangsamoro needs to be educated on the lives and heroism of these brave men to better understand the fundamental principles which they fought for: freedom, justice, and autonomy. Everyone should support the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in our campaign for justice and dignity. Not only did they accomplish their mission, but they also made the Bangsamoro people proud and serve as an inspiration to future Bangsamoro leaders.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly urged.
