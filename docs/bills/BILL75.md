**AN ACT**
**IMPLEMENTING THE PEOPLE’S RIGHT TO INFORMATION IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO, PROVIDING GUIDELINES THEREFOR, AND PROVIDING PENALTIES FOR THE VIOLATION THEREOF**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The constitutional guarantee of the right to information on matters of public concern enunciated in Section 7 of Article III of the 1987 Constitution complements the State’s policy of full public disclosure in all transactions involving public interest expressed in Section 28 of Article II of the 1987 Constitution. These provisions are aimed at ensuring transparency in policy-making as well as in the operations of the Government, and at safeguarding the exercise by the people of the freedom of expression.

An essential element of this freedom is to keep open a continuing dialogue or process of communication between the government and the people. It is in the interest of the State that the channels for free political discussion be maintained to the end that the government may perceive and be responsive to the people’s will. Thus, this open dialogue can be effective only to the extent that the citizenry is informed and thus able to formulate its will intelligently. Only when the participants in the discussion are aware of the issues and have access to information relating thereto can such bear fruit.

While the Supreme Court has consistently held that the right to information under Constitution is self-executory, there is a need to pass legislation that will provide the substantive and procedural details for its implementation which include reasonable conditions and limitations on the access granted consistent with the declared State policy of full public disclosure of all transactions involving public interest.

Recognizing the importance of the people’s right to information, and guided by the President’s Executive Order on FOI and the Chief Minister’s call for moral governance, this representation deems it necessary to provide a local mechanism for the offices in the Bangsamoro government where the people’s right to information is respected and upheld and will help restore trust and confidence in government, subject to exceptions provided by law and jurisprudence.

In view of the foregoing, approval of this bill is earnestly sought.
