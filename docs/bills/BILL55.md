**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

“Every infant and child has the right to good nutrition according to the Convention on the Rights of Child”.
-	*Global Strategy of Infant and Young Child Feeding*

The relationship between food security, nutrition and human resource development has long been established. Food security is vital in realizing and sustaining a healthy nutritional wellbeing. Healthy individuals are better equipped to provide for their and their family’s needs. Meanwhile, having a workplace that is food secure and is well-nourished is a condition sine qua non to sustainable development. Conversely, countries that fall behind others in terms of development indices often perform poorly in global food and nutrition rankings. Simply put, the importance of nutrition in human resource development and therefore in a state’s development, could not be overstated. The recently published 2020 Global Nutrition Report provides insight on substantial inequities with countries, which mostly affects the vulnerable groups that are concealed by global and national patterns. It is undeniable that inequities can lead to malnutrition, however, there is also a reverse causation in the sense that malnutrition can increase inequities because those who are insecure and malnourished are likely to have poorer development outcomes. This results in the vicious cycle that if left unchecked, it will only worsen over time.

It is alarming that the Philippines is among the countries that are not on track to meet even a single of the 2025 global nutrition targets. However, in the 2020 Global Nutrition Report, the Philippines is ‘on course’ to meet one target for maternal, infant and young child nutrition (MIYCN). The report shows some progress has been made towards achieving the target of reducing anaemia among women of reproductive age, with 12.3% of women aged 15 to 49 years and further made some progress towards achieving the target for stunting, with 30.3% of children under 5 years of age are still affected, which is still higher than the average for the Asia region (21.8%). Meanwhile, no progress has been made towards achieving the low birth weight target, with 20.1% of infants having a low weight at birth and no progress towards achieving the target for wasting, with 5.6% of children under 5 years of age affected.

In addition to that, the Philippines in 2015-2020, showed 64% of the total population were chronically food insecure, of which 17% moderately food insecure and 8% severely food insecure. Then out of the 71 provinces it was analysed that Lanao del Sur and Sulu were among the provinces who were experiencing severe chronic food insecurity with (IPC Level 4) which is driven by poor food consumption quality, quantity and high level of chronic undernutrition.

This contextualization is important because it puts into perspective the situation in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) when we consider the following findings in the 2015 Updating National Nutrition Survey that shows the region has higher prevalence rate for stunting of under-five children at 45.2%, school age children (5-10 years old) at 44%, pre-adolescent and older children (10-19 years old) at 44.9% and chronic energy deficiency (CED) rate among adult (above 20 years old) at 10.2%. Furthermore, wasting among under-five children is at 8.2%, 5-10 years old at 6.3%, and 10-19 years old at 9.3%. BARMM also recorded the prevalence rate for nutritionally at risk pregnant women with 19.5% and overweight among lactating mothers at 24.4%. The region also posted very low indicators in meeting minimum dietary diversity with 12.2% versus the Philippine data of 29.2%. On a larger scale, the region shows only 30.4% of households with diets meeting energy requirements. All these results capture the overall state of nutrition in the region, which will serve as a public concern of the Bangsamoro Government.

Evidence study done by Save by the Children and Department of Science and Technology - Food and Nutrition Research Institute in 2016, the cost of undernutrition is a burden shouldered not only by one third of Filipino children, but by the entire nation. Beyond the health implications for each individual child, malnutrition hinders a child’s capability to achieve his/her full potential as a learner and his/her future productivity as a worker and a contributor to the Philippines. Thus, the cost of undernutrition to the Philippine economy is 4.5 Billion Dollars. This is equivalent to 2.84% of our country’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2013.

Fortunately, the Philippines have not been idle in trying to tackle the issues. In fact, as early as 1947, the National Government already took note of the importance of promoting the citizen’s nutrition when it attempted to institutionalize a national nutrition program through the creation of the Philippine Institute of Nutrition. Significant gains were made when the National Nutrition Council (NNC) was created in 1974 through Presidential Decree 491 also known as the “Nutrition Act of the Philippines”, a declaration that nutrition is the priority of the national government to be implemented by all branches of the government in an integrated fashion.

Moreover, one of the functions of the National Nutrition Council is to oversee and lead the formulation of the Philippine Plan of Action for Nutrition (PPAN) which serves as the blueprint for achieving nutritional adequacies for all Filipinos and the commitment of the Philippine government in addressing all forms of malnutrition in the country. The NNC has been formulating this 5-year plan since 1978, which has been integrated as a companion plan of the 5-year Philippine Development Plan. Starting from ARMM in 2018, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao has crafted its Regional Plan of Action for Nutrition (RPAN) 2020-2022 to fight hunger and malnutrition and to achieve the desired outcomes of reduced stunting, wasting, micronutrient deficiencies, low birth weight infants and nutritionally at-risk pregnant women

However, despite the institutionalization done from the national down to the local level, there are still gaps that need to be addressed if BARMM intends to meet not just national but global nutrition standards. There are also lessons that could be gleaned from the experience of other Local Government Units (LGU) in implementing the PPAN 2017-2022. These lessons include among others, the following: (1) the significance of strengthening capacities across different levels of government, (2) the institutional buy-in and impact of cooperation among public officials, (3) the value of harnessing grassroots efforts for better program outcomes.

In Executive Order No. 138, entitled “Full Devolution of Certain Functions of the Executive Branch to Local Governments, Creation of a Committee on Devolution, and for other purposes”, it was cited in Section 4, that the functions, services and facilities which shall be fully devolved from the National Government (NG) to the Local Government Units no later than the end of FY 2024, shall include those indicated under Section 17 of Republic Act 7160 (Local Government Code of 1991) and other existing laws which subsequently devolved functions of the NG to LGUs. It further mandates that, the local government shall be primarily and ultimately responsible and accountable for the provision of all the basic services and facilities fully devolved to them in accordance with the standards for service delivery to be prescribed by the NG.

In accordance with Section 17 (g) of RA No. 7160, the basic services and facilities fully devolved shall be funded from the share of the LGUs in the proceeds of national taxes and other local revenues. Local Chief Executives shall ensure that any fund or resources available for the use of their respective LGUs shall be first allocated for the provision of basic services or facilities devolved before applying the same for other purposes, in accordance with relevant laws and budgeting and auditing laws, rules and regulations.

Taking stock of the situation, the enactment of the RA No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law itself provides the region a great opportunity to enhance institutional capacities through the establishment of a mechanism that would adopt a systems approach to solving food insecurity and malnutrition. In addition, a mechanism that promotes collaboration and cooperation, both vertically and horizontally, among stakeholders allows creative problem-solving. Finally, ensuring participation in all levels fosters alignment of goals, sharing of values and increased ownership.

Our ongoing experience with the coronavirus disease (COVID19) pandemic is a stark reminder that as the pandemic rages on, it will only exacerbate inequities in the country and the Bangsamoro region, thereby worsening food insecurity and malnutrition. Regrettably, all this disproportionately affects different members of society.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
