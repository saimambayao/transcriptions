**AN ACT**
**DECLARING BALOBOK CAVE IN BONGAO, TAWI-TAWI AS A REGIONAL HERITAGE ZONE, PROVIDING FOR ITS PROTECTION, PRESERVATION, AND PROMOTION, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Tawi-Tawi, the far-south islands of the Philippines is known to have been blessed in numerous aspects.

The islands of the Philippines were first introduced to Islam during the 14th century through the seas and straits of Tawi-Tawi. In recent years, when the region was afflicted with an almost perpetual cycle of violent conflicts, the province of Tawi-Tawi remained peaceful. More peaceful even compared to other provinces in the country.

Despite having been isolated from the greater lands in the country, surrounded by its vast coastline, the province thrived through its bountiful aquatic resources. Tawi-Tawi boasts of its ecological balance. The iconic Bud Bongao remains inhabited by wildlife unique to the province. The islands are home to several flora and fauna species.

Its history, culture, natural resources, scenery, and pristine beaches, all of these together make up a cornucopia of a tourist haven. Yet, there is still more to explore. In Barangay Lakit-Lakit, east of Bongao Municipality lies a rock formation and part of a cave system situated along the coast, named by the locals as the *Balobok*.

The Balobok Cave is found to be one of the earliest human settlements in Southeast Asia dating back to 8,000 years ago. Recent efforts to excavate the area led to the discovery of ancient artifacts such as earthenware shards, polished stones, and bone tools. Also, some accounts point out that the cave served as a natural shelter for the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) combatants in the 1970s.

Due to the significance of this archeological site, it is only natural for the Bangsamoro Government to preserve, protect, promote and develop the Balobok Cave in Bongao, Tawi-Tawi. This bill seeks to declare the Balobok Cave as a regional heritage zone.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
