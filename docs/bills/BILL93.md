**Explanatory Note**

Section 1, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution provides that, "[t]he State shall promote industrialization and full employment based on sound agricultural development and agrarian reform, through industries that make full and efficient use of human and natural resources, and which are competitive in both domestic and foreign markets." The Constitution further provides in Section 5, Article XIII that, "[t]he State shall recognize the right of farmers, farmworkers, and landowners, as well as cooperatives, and other independent farmers’ organizations to participate in the planning, organization, and management of the program, and shall provide support to agriculture through appropriate technology and research, and adequate financial, production, marketing, and other support services."

In the case of *Philippine Coconut Producers Federation, Inc. (COCOFED), et. al. v. Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG), G.R. No. 75713, October 2, 1989*, the Supreme Court held that "it cannot be denied that the coconut industry is one of the major industries supporting the national economy. It is, therefore, the State’s concern to make it a strong and secure source not only of the livelihood of a significant segment of the population, but also of export earnings the sustained growth of which is one of the imperatives of economic stability."

The coconut industry is currently progressing. The economic well-being of a major part of the population depends a large extent on the viability of the coconut industry and its improvement in the areas of production, processing and marketing.

Section 23, Article XIII of R.A. No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) provides that with the policies and laws of the Bangsamoro Government on agriculture as a key development strategy, it shall promote productivity measures, and provide support for small farmers, landholders and marginal fisherfolk.

Based on the Crops Production Survey (CrPS) released by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is the 6th region with the most coconut production from July to September 2021 with 352,100 metric tons of total coconut production. Also, on another survey released by PSA entitled “2019 BARMM Other Crops Production”, Coconut (with husk) is recognized as the region’s number 1 Non-Food and Industrial Crop with 1,331,804.97 metric tons of total production.

The coconut industry is an important pillar of the region’s agriculture as it is among the major industries in the BARMM. Its development would mean significant improvement in the lives of the people of the region. The industry needs an intensive and extensive effort in order to promote integrated development and growth of the industry in all its aspects, in order to reach the full potential of the industry and to ensure that coconut farmers are the direct participants in, and beneficiaries of, such development and growth. In addition, the issues surrounding the industry should also be acted upon by the appropriate agency in order to achieve inclusive development.

The Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) is the government agency that is tasked to develop the coconut industry to its full potential in line with the new vision of a united, globally competitive, and efficient coconut industry. Currently, the PCA has no counterpart in Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).

It is also worth noting that more than half of the coconut trees in Basilan have been plagued by coconut scale insects also known as *cocolisap*. A *cocolisap* attack is manifested by the yellowish color of the leaves of the coconut trees thereby reducing the coconut fruits and gradually killing the trees. Time and enough funding are needed to mass-produce the biological control agents that are used minimize the population of the *cocolisap*. The BARMM has no means to assist the farmers affected by the said calamity.

The creation of the Bangsamoro Coconut Authority (BCA), as proposed in this measure, will promote and protect the coconut industry in the region, considering the importance of the industry in nation-building, it being one of the principal industries in the BARMM. The BCA will serve the Bangsamoro Region, thereby promoting and maintaining the development of the industry in the region.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
