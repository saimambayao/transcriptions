**AN ACT**
**STRENGTHENING THE PROMOTION AND DELIVERY OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BY ESTABLISHING STRUCTURES AND MECHANISMS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**Explanatory Note**

Section 13, Article II of the 1987 Constitution states that the State recognizes the vital role of the youth in nation-building and shall promote and protect their physical, moral, spiritual, intellectual, and social well-being. It shall inculcate in the youth patriotism and nationalism, and encourage their involvement in public and civic affairs.

Moreover, Section 15 of the same article states that the State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. This same provision was also stated in Section 22, Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), which states that "The Bangsamoro Government shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. It shall also uphold the peoples' right to have access to essential goods health, and other social services that promote their well-being."

The World Health Organization defines mental health as, "a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community."¹ This encompasses not only emotional resilience but also the social and psychological aspects of well-being, all of which contribute to optimal health.

WHO further emphasizes that "exposure to unfavorable social, economic, geopolitical, and environmental circumstances—including poverty, violence, inequality, and environmental deprivation—also increases people's risk of experiencing mental health conditions."²

Mental health is a fundamental human right, and every individual, regardless of who they are or where they come from, has the inherent right to the highest attainable standard of mental health.³

Health is not merely the absence of illness or disease; it also includes full physical, mental, and social well-being. Despite this, the government has historically given little attention to mental health services.

In October 2023, the Philippine Mental Health Association Inc. (PMHA) raised alarms about the growing epidemic of mental health crises in the country. According to the Department of Health (DOH), at least 3.6 million Filipinos suffer from mental, neurological, and substance use disorders. Alarmingly, the country has less than one mental health worker for every 100,000 Filipinos.⁴

Republic Act No. 11036, or the Mental Health Act, was enacted in 2018, marking a significant step toward a comprehensive mental health framework. Since its passage, the Philippines has scaled up mental health services and essential medicines, with 362 access sites nationwide dispensing 30 mental health medicines to 124,246 service users in 2022. However, despite these commendable efforts, the "silent epidemic" of mental health issues persists, particularly in the Bangsamoro region, demanding urgent attention.

The WHO Mental Health Report 2022 reveals that globally, one in every 100 deaths is by suicide, making it the leading cause of death among adolescents. In the Philippines, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported a 57.3% increase in the suicide rate in 2020, with 4,892 cases, particularly among individuals aged 15 to 29.⁵

Furthermore, the National Center for Mental Health (NCMH) reported in September 2023 that it has received 17,884 suicide-related calls since the launch of its crisis hotline in 2019, with a significant increase during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The stigma surrounding mental health, coupled with limited access to competent care, has exacerbated mental health issues in the region. Societal shame often leads families to isolate members with psychological disorders, further marginalizing them. Moreover, the nation has a severe lack of public mental health institutions, leaving many without adequate care.

The Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA), as the interim government of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, is mandated to protect the general welfare of the Bangsamoro people. This includes providing a platform for delivering comprehensive and integrated mental health services that are both accessible and affordable to the public.

Given the alarming prevalence of mental health-related issues, it is imperative to enact legislation that allows the Bangsamoro people to achieve the highest attainable standard of mental health. A bill addressing the significant burden of mental illness and improving mental health and well-being in the region is urgently needed.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
