**AN ACT**
**REQUIRING MULTI-HAZARD MAPS AND FLOOD HAZARD MAPS IN ALL VULNERABLE BARMM TERRITORIES, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Hazard mapping, a mechanism apparent in Japan and other countries prone to natural disasters, is a proactive measure that can help save lives in times of calamities. During disasters, local government units (LGUs) are under extreme pressure to make abrupt decisions affecting thousands of people, often with limited time to analyze situations and undertake actions.¹

Maps are cartographically simple with information enabling local chief executives to make prompt and appropriate responses, especially in emergencies. Maps help LGUs identify, prioritize, and allocate resources to vulnerable population in high-risk areas for safe evacuation, rescue, relief and rehabilitation.²

Once enacted, the law can require all local government units down to the barangay level to conduct community-based briefings, identify hazardous areas, ensure that no structures are built in these areas, and help the public prepare for possible impacts. This can be beneficial to all communities across the BARMM, especially to the most vulnerable sectors.

**SECTION 1. Short Title.** – This Act shall be known as the “*Bangsamoro Multi-Hazard Maps and Flood Hazard Maps Act of 2023.*”

**SEC. 2. Declaration of Policy.** – It is hereby declared the policy of the Bangsamoro Government to maintain and ensure the delivery of disaster-preparedness programs by providing accurate and updated multi-hazard and flood hazard maps in vulnerable territories within the region.

**SEC. 3. Definitions.** – For purposes of this Act, the following terms shall mean:

a. *Multi-hazard map* is a map that identifies and depicts areas that are vulnerable to multiple natural hazards such as earthquakes, floods, landslides, wildfires and tropical storms.

b. *Flood hazard map* is a map that identifies and depicts areas that are vulnerable to flooding caused by natural disasters, such as storms and heavy rainfall. It likewise specifies inundation risk areas and contains basic evacuation information.

c. *Vulnerable territories* are areas that are at high risk for natural disasters and have a history of being affected by such disasters.

**SEC. 4. Creation of Multi-Hazard and Flood Hazard Maps.** – The Ministry of the Interior and Local Government (MILG) through the Bangsamoro Rapid Emergency Action on Disaster Incidence (BARMM READI) shall facilitate the creation of multi-hazard maps and flood hazard maps for all vulnerable territories within the Bangsamoro region.

The multi-hazard maps and flood hazard maps shall be based on the best available data and information gathered by the local government units (LGUs) in the Bangsamoro region, including historical data, scientific research, and modeling. They shall be updated at least once every five years, or more frequently as necessary, to reflect changes in land use, natural processes, and climate conditions.

**SEC. 5. Availability of Multi-Hazard and Flood Hazard Maps.** – The BARMM READI shall make the multi-hazard maps and flood hazard maps available to the public through an online portal, in a user-friendly format that can be easily accessed and understood. It shall also provide copies of the maps to the LGUs within the high-risk areas for natural disasters. The LGUs shall ensure that the maps are readily accessible to their constituents.

**SEC. 6. Compliance and Enforcement.** – The LGUs shall incorporate the multi-hazard maps and flood hazard maps into their disaster preparedness and mitigation plans, and use them to inform land-use decisions, building codes, and other policies and regulations. For this purpose, the BARMM READI shall provide technical assistance and training to LGUs and other stakeholders on how to interpret and use said maps to enhance disaster preparedness, mitigation, and response efforts.

The Ministry shall provide incentives and grants to LGUs that demonstrate compliance with this Act and make significant progress in reducing their vulnerability to natural disasters.

The Ministry shall also have the authority to withhold disaster relief funding to LGUs that fail to comply with this Act or demonstrate a lack of progress in reducing their vulnerability to natural disasters.

**SEC. 7. Appropriations.** – The amount necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act shall be charged against the MILG’s current budget and shall thereafter be included in the annual Appropriations Act.

**SEC. 8. Separability Clause.** – In case any provision of this Act is declared unconstitutional or invalid, the other provisions hereof which are not affected thereby shall continue in full force and effect.

**SEC. 9. Repealing Clause.** – All regional laws, decrees, executive orders, rules and regulations and other issuances or parts thereof which are inconsistent with this Act are hereby repealed, amended or modified accordingly.
