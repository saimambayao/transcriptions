**AN ACT**
**RENAMING THE SANGA-SANGA AIRPORT IN BONGAO, PROVINCE OF TAWI-TAWI AS THE TAWI-TAWI AIRPORT**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Tawi-Tawi, known as the "Cradle of Islam" in the country, is one of the five provinces which comprise the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). It includes 11 island municipalities, most of which are located in the Sulu Archipelago.

Much of these islands are abundant in fish and marine resources, and because of its rich coastal communities, the province has long been considered as the seaweed capital of the Philippines, and the carrageenan capital of the world, one of the world’s foremost food and industrial additives.

In order to showcase the treasures and beauty of the island province, its rich aquatic resources, and beautiful historical sites, it is only fitting that the Sanga-Sanga airport in the Municipality of Bongao be renamed as the Tawi-Tawi Airport.

The said provincial airport is classified by the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) as a class two principal (minor domestic) airport and is considered as the world’s gateway into the province.

Not only is the use of "Tawi-Tawi" practical, given its widespread use and awareness globally, but it also provides its people with a sense of pride in the rich history of their land, home, and people.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
