**AN ACT ESTABLISHING A COMMUNITY-BASED HEALTH AND WELLNESS PROGRAM FOR SENIOR CITIZENS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO, PROVIDING FOR INCLUSIVE ACCESS TO ESSENTIAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is home to a growing population of senior citizens, many of whom have lived through decades of armed conflict, displacement, and limited access to essential social services. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), there were 181,764 individuals aged 60 years and above in BARMM as of the 2020 Census—comprising over 4% of the region’s population.¹ This number is expected to rise significantly by 2030 due to demographic transition trends observed across the Philippines.²

Despite this growth, older persons in the region remain among the most underserved sectors in terms of health access, social protection, and inclusion. Many elderly Bangsamoro live in remote, conflict-affected, or geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas (GIDAs), where basic health services are either limited or entirely absent. According to the Department of Health and national reports, BARMM has consistently posted the lowest vaccination coverage for senior citizens, with only 46% of its A2 population (senior citizens) vaccinated against COVID-19 as of mid-2022, far below the national average.³ The region’s Expanded Program on Immunization has also struggled to achieve full routine vaccine coverage due to logistical challenges, limited health personnel, and sociocultural barriers.⁴

Moreover, as of 2023, BARMM still lacks a dedicated, region-wide program for geriatric health and wellness. There are no institutionalized Geriatric Wellness Centers, and mobile outreach systems are not yet equipped to deliver age-appropriate services such as physical therapy, mental health support, assistive devices, or home-based care for bedridden elders.

The gap is not merely logistical—it is systemic and structural. There is no consolidated Senior Citizen Health Information System (SCHIS) in place, leaving many senior citizens invisible to public planners. Moreover, there is no comprehensive training program on geriatric care for barangay health workers, caregivers, or community-based staff in BARMM.

As of 2021, data from the Department of Health’s Field Health Service Information System (FHSIS) shows that only 3.8% of senior citizens in BARMM received comprehensive geriatric checkups. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates for the elderly remain below 10%, far from the Department of Health’s national targets. There are currently no dedicated Geriatric Wellness Centers in the region, and most barangay health stations lack the capacity or trained personnel to provide geriatric-specific services. While some local government units conduct medical missions or outreach programs, these are often sporadic, donor-dependent, and not systematized.

In terms of institutional support, the Ministry of Social Services and Development (MSSD) has existing mandates for senior welfare, but there remains no dedicated region-wide framework for geriatric wellness and healthy ageing. Health and ageing remain fragmented concerns, divided between health centers, LGUs, and civil society actors without integration or shared strategic direction.

This proposed measure, therefore, seeks to establish the Bangsamoro Healthy Ageing and Wellness Program (BHAWP)—a comprehensive, culturally respectful, and community-based response to the health and social care needs of the elderly population in BARMM.

The intent of this bill is to build a society where no elder in BARMM grows old in neglect—where each senior citizen, regardless of income, location, religion, or health status, receives the care, honor, and protection that they deserve. Through this measure, the Bangsamoro Parliament commits to strengthening intergenerational solidarity, social inclusion, and institutional responsibility for our elders.

In light of the foregoing, the immediate passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
