**AN ACT**
**REGULATING THE ADVERTISEMENT, PACKAGING, LABELING, DISPLAY, SALE, PREPARATION, AND SERVING OF HALAL FOOD IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Halal refers to what is permissible or lawful in traditional Islamic law. It has become a seal that symbolizes that a product’s standards comply with Islamic dietary requirements or Islamic lifestyle, which is synonymous with quality, cleanliness, and health standards.

It has evolved from being a food preference to assurance of food safety, hygiene, and reliability. Food safety, for example, is assured every time slaughtered halal animals undergo two health checks compared to single inspections performed on conventional animals.

Complementary to this, drinking alcohol and eating blood, pork, by-products of pork and blood, animals that are dead before slaughtering, and those not killed in the name of Allah are considered haram or forbidden. It is easy to avoid these ingredients but what about when the ingredients are disguised as something else?

The proposed measure also seeks to protect the welfare of the Bangsamoro people through the regulation of halal and non-halal food items. It is relevant to note that in order to be labeled as halal, it is required that all identified points within the operation, preparation, or processing of halal meat or food must be religiously acceptable.

This religious procedure is consistent with all widely used food industry-based safety protocols which ensure safety by controlling major food risks, such as microbiological, chemical, and physical contaminants. Hence, by regulating the advertisement, packaging, labeling, display, sale, preparation, and serving of halal food, we are also guaranteeing the quality of the food product or commodity.

We must aim to support the region’s bid to become one of the world’s Halal industry champions. One way to do this is to increase and strengthen the market competitiveness of our halal processed products to ensure their genuineness and authenticity. Through this measure, not only can we improve the goodwill and integrity of halal-certified companies in the market, but we can also instill and put in place the best practices in the industry to foster public faith and protect health, safety, and welfare of the Bangsamoro people.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
