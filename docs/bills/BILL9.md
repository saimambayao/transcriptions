**CREATING THE HASHIM SALAMAT MUNICIPALITY UNDER THE MAGUINDANAO PROVINCE, WHICH SHALL BE COMPOSED OF THE 63 BARANGAYS IN THE COTABATO PROVINCE WHICH JOINED THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION, DEFINING ITS POWERS AND FUNCTIONS, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREOF, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**Explanatory Note**

This bill seeks to create a new municipality in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) to be known as the **Hashim Salamat Municipality**. It shall be composed of sixty-three (63) barangays from the six (6) municipalities in the Cotabato Province that opted to join the BARMM in a plebiscite held on February 6, 2019.

Section 10, Article VI of the Organic Law provides that the authority of the Bangsamoro Government to regulate the affairs of its constituent local government units shall be guaranteed in accordance with the Organic Law and Bangsamoro Local Government Code to be enacted by the Parliament.

Section 4, Article XIII of the Organic Law underscores that the development plans, programs and projects of the Bangsamoro Government shall take into account the development plans of the provinces, cities, municipalities and barangays as approved by their respective local development council.

Section 2, Article XIII of the same law mandates that the Bangsamoro Government shall likewise provide equitable opportunities for the development of constituent local government units and shall strengthen the governance system to enhance people's participation.

Specifically, the parliament may create, divide, merge, abolish, or substantially alter boundaries of municipalities or barangays in accordance with a law enacted by the Parliament (Section 2[I], Article V, BOL). The municipalities or barangays created, divided, merged, or whose boundaries are substantially altered, shall be entitled to their appropriate share in the national taxes or Internal Revenue Allotment: Provided, That the criteria laid down in Republic Act No. 7160 or Local Government Code (LGC), as amended, and other national laws shall be satisfied: Provided, Further, That it shall be approved by a majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite in the political units directly affected.

Section 4, Article 15 of the same law allows the reconstitution of local government units. Specifically, it provides that [t]he Parliament may, by law, provide for the reconstitution of geographical areas in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region into appropriate territorial or political subdivisions depending on the results of the plebiscite. Nothing herein shall be construed to allow the Parliament to create legislative districts.

Under Section 442 of R.A. 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991 (LGC), there are four requisites in order for a new municipality to be created. Under Section 442 the following requisites must be met:

1. A municipality may be created if it has an average annual income, as certified by the provincial treasurer, of at least Two million five hundred thousand pesos (P2,500,000.00) for the last two (2) consecutive years based on the 1991 constant prices; a population of at least twenty-five thousand (25,000) inhabitants as certified by the National Statistics Office; and a contiguous territory of at least fifty (50) square kilometers as certified by the Lands Management Bureau: Provided, That the creation thereof shall not reduce the land area, population or income of the original municipality or municipalities at the time of said creation to less than the minimum requirements prescribed herein;

2. The territorial jurisdiction of a newly-created municipality shall be properly identified by metes and bounds. The requirement on land area shall not apply where the municipality proposed to be created is composed of one (1) or more islands. The territory need not be contiguous if it comprises two (2) or more islands;

3. The average annual income shall include the income accruing to the general fund of the municipality concerned, exclusive of special funds, transfers and non-recurring income;

4. Municipalities existing as of the date of the effectivity of this Code shall continue to exist and operate as such. Existing municipal districts organized pursuant to presidential issuances or executive orders and which have their respective set of elective municipal officials holding office at the time of the effectivity of this Code shall henceforth be considered as regular municipalities (lifted from Section 442, R.A. 7160, Official Gazette).

In the case of the proposed municipality, based on data from the Commission on Audit (COA), the total income for C.Y. 2020 of the 63 component barangays amount to Two Hundred Twenty-Eight Million Seventy-Three Thousand Three Hundred Eight Six and Ten Centavos (Php 228,073,386.10), which satisfies the required average income of a municipality. Furthermore, based on the 2020 Census of Population and Housing conducted by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the 63 component barangays of the proposed Hashim Salamat municipality has a population of Two Hundred Fifteen Thousand Four Hundred Thirty-Three (215,433). As for the metes and bounds, the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources and Energy (MENRE) is tasked to provide the legal description of the metes and bounds of the 63 barangays.

Given these and based on the supporting documents and data submitted pertaining to the required population and income, and when the legal description of metes and bounds will be provided by the MENRE, the proposed municipality will meet the requirements set forth in the Local Government Code.

The creation of a new municipality will enable the 63 barangays to act on their own initiative to adopt local ordinances and laws and resolutions that will promote the general welfare of their people.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this legislative measure is earnestly sought.
