**AN ACT**
**TO PROMOTE AND PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS IN THE BANGSAMORO REGION**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Human rights are inextricably linked to state-building. Both share the fundamental element of human relations. UNESCO once stated that at the core of human rights are human relations.$^1$ Similarly, state-building is driven by state-society relations$^2$ as well as its ability to regulate intra-societal relations. The intersectionality of types of oppression and discrimination one might face in society vis-à-vis the privileges that others enjoy all the more highlight the importance of human rights in state-building. After all, human rights are such rights that are inherent to us all, regardless of background or status.$^3$ And the state is duty-bound to promote and protect the exercise of these rights. As Derek Evans aptly put, "*The central role of the state is to ensure that rights are respected and realized, to act as the 'social guarantor' of fundamental human rights that is established through both political processes and legal instruments.*"$^4$

It is in understanding the interrelatedness of these concepts that we are able to draw on the relevance of safeguarding human rights at a time when discussions on them in both public and political spheres are highly polarizing. With many seeking to downplay the importance of human rights—and worse, others who demonize those who defend their free exercise. Not to mention, given the observations and comments from the international community and multilateral institutions, like the United Nations, on the need to proactively strengthen and protect the free exercise of human rights in the country. The urgency is clear when we think of how the COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced and exacerbated the long-existing social cleavages in our society.

For the Bangsamoro Region, the promotion and protection of human rights and those who defend them are of even greater importance. Historically, among the roots of armed conflict that have haunted our forebears are the numerous human rights violations committed by the State, state-sponsored groups, and non-state armed groups that manifest as both vertical and horizontal violence.$^5$ Moreover, our collective gains through the peace process that culminated with the formation of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is an opportune time to strengthen human rights as a foundation of post-conflict transformation and peacebuilding. Various literature have pointed out the relationship between development and human rights. Specifically, in a key finding of research done by the Danish Institute for Human Rights, they found out that, "**the rights to freedom of speech, freedom, and assembly and association and electoral self-determination have a significant positive effect on economic growth**".$^6$

As one author posited, a holistic approach to human rights in conflict transformation should consider the multiple dimensions of human rights as: (1) rules, (2) structures and institutions, (3) relationships, and (4) processes.$^7$ We, as privileged Members of this august body, have a unique window of opportunity to influence these dimensions during this transition period—to lay the foundations of a robust, vibrant, and human rights-loving Bangsamoro society. No less than the 1987 Constitution provides that, "[t]he State values the dignity of every human person and guarantees full respect for human rights."$^8$ This is echoed in our very own Bangsamoro Organic Law, where it is the duty of the Bangsamoro Government to fully respect human rights.$^9$ As efforts to enact legislation protecting human rights defenders at the

national level are gaining ground, we too must provide complementary legislation that can even set the tone for others.

The multidimensional nature of human rights requires us to not only facilitate structural and policy change, but also complement top-down approaches with bottom-up mechanisms. The members of civil society are our integral partners in advocating for human rights. It is but rational that we endeavor their protection so that we can truly pave the way for a broad-based human rights approach to moral governance and conflict transformation in the BARMM. Our partners who serve as “defenders” of human rights must be given the institutional support for them to freely serve as force multipliers in promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms. At the same time, we need to ensure that safeguards are present so that we can hold our own in government accountable in case of violations. By instituting reforms to safeguard our human rights, we as freedom-loving peoples, manifested in our struggle for self-determination, can move forward and help ensure that the horrors that plagued our forebears no longer affect the succeeding generations.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
