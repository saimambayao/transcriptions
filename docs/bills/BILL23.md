**AN ACT**
**ESTABLISHING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC REPARATION AND BENEFIT INITIATIVES FOR ORPHANS OF WAR, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSE**

Be it enacted by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority in session assembled:

**CHAPTER I**
**Preliminary Provisions**

**Section 1. Short Title.** — This Act shall be known as “Social and Economic Reparation and Benefit Initiatives for Orphans of War Act”.

**Section 2. Declaration of Policies.** — Section 9 of Article II of the 1987 Constitution declares that the State shall promote a just and dynamic social order that will ensure the prosperity and independence of the nation and free the people from poverty through policies that provide adequate social services, promote full employment, a rising standard of living, and an improved quality of life for all. In line with this declared State policy, Section 1 of Article IX of the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao mandates the Bangsamoro Parliament, taking into account the report of the Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Commission, to enact a transitional justice mechanism to address the legitimate grievances of the Bangsamoro people and the indigenous peoples, such as historical injustices, human rights violations, and marginalization through unjust dispossession of territorial and proprietary rights and customary land tenure.

Section 2 of Article II of the 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines declares that the State adopts generally accepted principles of international law as part of the law of the land. The Philippines is a state party to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). CRC Article 20 provides that a child temporarily or permanently deprived of his or her family environment, or in whose own best interests cannot be allowed to remain in that environment, shall be entitled to special protection and assistance provided by the State. Consistent with this provisions, Section 14 of Article IX of the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao also provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall respect, protect and promote the rights of children, especially orphans of tender age. They shall be protected from exploitation, abuse or discrimination. Their education and development, both physical and mental, shall be protected from exploitation, abuse, or discrimination. Their education and development, both physical and mental, shall be fully addressed. Bangsamoro policies and programs shall take into utmost consideration the best interest of children, and promote and protect the rights of children, youth, and adolescents, including their survival and development.

In the fulfillment of its aspirations for self-determination, peace and justice, the Bangsamoro people were involved in armed conflicts which claimed numerous lives and left innocent children as destitute and vulnerable orphans.

Thence, the Bangsamoro Government has the obligation to indemnify these orphans by providing reparation and benefits to ensure their social and economic upliftment and redemption. The Bangsamoro Government shall undertake to create positive effects by recognizing the sufferings of these orphans of war and communicate to them their entitlements.

**Section 3. Definition of Terms.** — As used in this Act:

a. *Child* is a person under 18 years old, regardless of the status of his/her legitimacy.

b. *Documented victim of human rights violation* refers to a person included in the Regional Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Commission’s masterlist who identifies with the Bangsamoro people and/or non-moro indigenous peoples and/or other inhabitants of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region between March 18, 1968 and the present, and whose human rights were violated by State actors and State-affiliated armed groups, and/or non-State armed group, including, but not limited to, the following:
