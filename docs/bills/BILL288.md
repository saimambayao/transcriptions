**AN ACT PROVIDING RECOGNITION AND INCENTIVES TO BANGSAMORO AUTHORS WHO HAVE WRITTEN AND PUBLISHED BOOKS OF EXCELLENCE, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

In the annals of human history, the act of writing has transcended mere communication; it has become a beacon of enlightenment, a conduit for knowledge, a testament to the indomitable spirit of human creativity, a mirror reflecting the soul of society, and a catalyst for change. It is through the written word that we preserve our stories, articulate our dreams, and navigate the complexities of human existence. Crafting a book of exceptional quality demands more than mere ink on paper; it necessitates the dedication and passion of authors who dare to challenge norms, stimulate thought, and breathe life into their narratives.

Just as Dr. Jose Rizal's novels ignited the spirit of revolution and independence among the Filipino people, so too can the books of Bangsamoro authors inspire and empower the Bangsamoro people. Rizal's literary works served as a rallying cry for social justice and national identity, rallying a nation towards unity and freedom. By acknowledging and rewarding Bangsamoro authors who strive for literary excellence, we pay tribute to their commitment to preserving the rich tapestry of Bangsamoro culture, history, aspirations and enriching the region's literary landscape. Whether through the enchanting prose of a novel that captures the essence of Bangsamoro life or the scholarly insights of an academic tome that advances the frontiers of knowledge, each book carries with it the potential to shape minds, transform lives, and leave an indelible mark on the fabric of society.

As the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) embarks on its historic journey towards self-governance and autonomy, the role of books and book authors becomes ever more vital. The BARMM is a history in the making—a bold experiment in democracy and governance that has the potential to shape the course of generations to come. Yet, without the diligent efforts of book authors to document this journey, the history of the Bangsamoro people would remain shrouded in obscurity, lost to the annals of time.

This legislative measure stands as a tribute to the courage and dedication of those who have dared, and will continue to dare, to transcribe the intricate tapestry of human experience onto the pages of history. It acknowledges the profound sacrifices—of sweat, tears, and even life itself—that authors have willingly offered in their pursuit of truth and enlightenment. The power of words inked on books transcends the confines of time and space.

With this in mind, the passage of this legislative measure is earnestly sought.
