**AN ACT**
**PROVIDING FOR THE BANGSAMORO HYMN CODE OF DECORUM AND RULES**

*Be it enacted by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament in session assembled:*

**SECTION 1. Short title.** - This Act shall be known as the “Bangsamoro Hymn Decorum Act”.

**SECTION 2. Declaration of Policy.**- pursuant to Article II, Section 2 of **RA 11054, Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 7** known as *Bangsamoro Hymn Act of 2020*, approved on January 30, 2020; It is hereby declared the policy of the Bangsamoro Government to convey and preserve the Bangsamoro peoples’ identity, heritage, history, and aspirations. The hymn is a patriotic song and a rousing statement symbolizing the region’s self-determination (autonomy) and glory.

Towards this end, the region shall maintain established rules of conduct and decorum to be observed by citizens and guests as a display of utmost respect when the hymn is being played.

**SECTION 3. Coverage.** - this Act shall apply to all citizens and guests present during the playing or singing of the Bangsamoro Hymn. All ministries, government offices, agencies, and educational institutions (public and private) including local government units and government-owned or controlled corporations situated in the region are highly enjoined to observe the code of decorum provided in this Act.

**SECTION 4. Code of Decorum.** - the Bangsamoro Hymn Code of Decorum shall be as follows, to wit;

**4.1 Stand at Attention** - The Bangsamoro Hymn code of etiquette dictates that all crowds present must stand upright in the direction of the Bangsamoro flag if displayed. Standing while the hymn is being performed is a sign of respect.

**4.2 Face the Flag or direction of the sound.** - if one is displayed, it is necessary to face the Bangsamoro flag. In the event that it is not on display and the Bangsamoro Hymn is pre-recorded, face the direction of the sound. If the person singing the hymn is visible, face the person, and pay full attention throughout the singing of the hymn.

**4.3 Right Hand (Closed Fist) Over Chest.** - as soon as the singing of the hymn is announced, immediately rise, *for those who are able*, in anticipation and place a closed fist across the chest. Placing the hands across the chest applies to everyone including those who cannot stand on their own.

If the hymn starts to play while a person is walking, stop walking. Stand at attention and place the right hand over the heart until it is done.

Placing the right hand over the chest is an effective gesture that plays a critical role in symbolizing dignity and honor to the Bangsamoro people.

**4.4 Headdress Protocol.** - take off the hat with the right hand and place the right hand holding the headdress over the chest. The headdress protocol applies to men, women, children, and the elderly in attendance. This etiquette EXCLUDES any religious and culture-related headwear.

**4.5 Men in Uniform** - Hymn etiquette requires men in uniform to perform a military salute at the start of the singing of the hymn and hold this posture until the hymn’s last note ends.

**4.6 Avoid the use of technological devices** - the Hymn etiquette requires full attention must be given to the song and stay calm throughout the performance.

**4.7 Save the Applaud.** - The hymn is played in honor of the Bangsamoro people’s number one core value: the right to self-determination. It is not proper to clap after the song is completed.

**SECTION 5. Penal Provision.**- No punishment will be enforced for breaching the flag or the Bangsamoro Hymn Code of Decorum, but it is imperative to respect the brave Mujahideen and Mujahiddat who fought for the aspirations of the Bangsamoro people and to honor the symbols of the region by observing the same.

**SECTION 6. Implementing Rules and Regulations.** - The MILG in coordination with the MBHTE shall promulgate the necessary rules and regulations within ninety (90) days from the effectivity of this Act.

**SECTION 7. Separability Clause.** - If any provision of this Act shall be declared invalid or unconstitutional, such declaration shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Act.

**SECTION 8. Repealing Clause.** - All provisions of regional laws, Executive Orders, letters of instruction, and other regional issuances which are incompatible or inconsistent with the provisions of this Act are hereby deemed amended or repealed.

**SECTION 9. Effectivity.** - This Act shall take effect after fifteen (15) days following its publication in the two regional newspapers of general circulation in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.
