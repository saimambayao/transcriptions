**CREATING THE MINISTRY OF AGRARIAN REFORM, DEFINING ITS POWERS AND FUNCTIONS, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

This bill seeks to reorganize the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Agrarian Reform (MAFAR) by creating a separate Ministry of Agrarian Reform to address the distinct needs of the agrarian reform sector in the Bangsamoro Region.

Executive Order No. 229, series of 1987, and Proclamation No. 131 dated July 1987 provide for the institution of a comprehensive agrarian reform program which would be in pursuance of what was envisioned in Presidential Decree No. 27 that entailed the emancipation of tenants from the bondage with the soil. The Department of Agrarian Reform is mandated by law to be the principal agency responsible for implementing the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP), as provided for in Articles XII, XIII, and XVIII of the 1987 Constitution. In 1991, all powers and functions of the Department of Agrarian Reform under Section 5 of Executive Order No. 129-A were transferred to the Autonomous Regional Government in Muslim Mindanao by virtue of Executive Order No. 482 issued by President Corazon C. Aquino. Pursuant to said devolution of powers, the Department of Agrarian Reform was established in the ARMM and performed the powers and functions enumerated in EO No. 482.

With the passage of R.A. No. 11054 or the Organic Law for the BARMM and Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 13 or the Bangsamoro Administrative Code, the administration of agrarian reform is placed under a single ministry along with agriculture and fisheries. In order to effectively implement the CARP and to better address the significant issues on agrarian reform confronting the Bangsamoro Government, a separate ministry on agrarian reform should be established.

Under this proposed measure, the Ministry of Agrarian Reform shall be the principal agency to assist the Bangsamoro Government in the implementation of the agrarian reform law, programs and projects. It shall also implement national programs and projects intended for the Bangsamoro Region consistent with regional law, customs, and traditions of the Bangsamoro people.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.

**AN ACT**
**CREATING THE MINISTRY OF AGRARIAN REFORM, DEFINING ITS POWERS AND FUNCTIONS, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

Be it enacted by the Bangsamoro Parliament in session:

**Section 1. Declaration of Policies.** – (a) It shall be the policy of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to pursue a Regional Agrarian Reform Program suitable to the special circumstances prevailing in the area of autonomy, in accordance with the Constitution, Republic Act No. 11054 and other existing national laws and policies. The welfare of the landless farmers and farm workers will receive the highest consideration to promote social justice and move the region towards sound rural development and industrialization and the establishment of owner cultivators as a basis for the region's agriculture.

To this end, a more systematic equitable distribution and ownership of land, with due regard to the rights of the landowners to just compensation are essential. The need to preserve ecological balance in the region shall be given serious consideration to providing farmers and farm-workers the opportunities to enhance their dignity and improve the quality of their lives through greater productivity in agriculture. The agrarian reform program is founded on the rights of the landless farmers and farm-workers to own directly or collectively the land they till or in the case of other farm-workers, to receive a just share of the fruits thereof.

(b) The Bangsamoro Government shall facilitate and accelerate the equitable distribution of all alienable and disposable lands and other government agricultural lands that are in excess of what is needed for development for public use, subject to the priorities and limitations set forth by law;

(c) The Bangsamoro Government shall undertake appropriate measures to protect the ancestral domain and ancestral lands of the indigenous cultural communities;

(d) The Bangsamoro Government shall respect the rights of small landowners and shall provide incentives for voluntarily offered lands for sale/distribution in accordance with the provisions of the law on just compensation;

(e) The Bangsamoro Government shall be guided by the principle that it is its concern and responsibility to lift the economic and social status of the landless farmers and farm workers. Likewise, it shall also be guided by the principle that land has a social function and land ownership has corresponding social obligations and responsibilities. Landowners are encouraged not to leave their lands idle and abandoned but instead make them available for productive purposes to benefit not only themselves but others who are landless, thereby helping the less fortunate segments of society to become self-reliant in life;

(f) The Bangsamoro Government shall apply the principle of collective ownership and/or stewardship, whenever applicable, in accordance with the law in the disposition and utilization of other natural resources, including lands of the public domain under lease or concession suitable to agricultural production, subject to the prior rights, homestead rights of small settlers and the ancestral rights of the indigenous cultural communities;

(g) The Bangsamoro Government shall recognize the rights of farmers, farm- workers, landowners, cooperatives, and other independent farmers’ organizations, to participate in the planning, organization, and management of the programs. It shall provide support to agriculture through the provision of appropriate and adaptable technology transfer as a result of intensive research and adequate financial assistance for production, marketing, and other support services; and

(h) The Bangsamoro Government shall provide incentives to landowners affected by the program to invest the proceeds of their landholdings to promote and accelerate industrialization, employment, and privatization of public sector enterprises. Financial instruments used as payment of land shall contain features that shall enhance negotiability and acceptability in the marketplace. The Bangsamoro Government may lease underdeveloped lands of the public domain, and/or all acquired, sequestered, or foreclosed properties to qualified entities for the development of capital-intensive farms and traditional and pioneering crop production especially those for export subject to the prior rights of the beneficiaries under the law.
