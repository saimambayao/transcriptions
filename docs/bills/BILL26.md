**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

A fundamental proposition of democracy is the promise of genuine representation. It recognizes the political equality of all citizens, and legitimizes the consent of the sovereign People to be governed. Through free, fair, and sufficiently frequent elections, citizens select those who exercise political power on their behalf. It is then the duty of such elected officials to recognize and respond to the concerns of the sovereign People. Citizens, on their end, must keep track and influence the behavior of these officials, partly to ensure that their interests are satisfactorily represented.

Acting as stewards of the region, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) is in the process of setting-up the necessary institutional mechanisms in preparation for the first elections in 2022, on top of managing and implementing day-to-day governance. Part of this responsibility is ensuring that meaningful and effective representation is achieved especially for the marginalized sectors of society. The Bangsamoro Parliament, as the wielder of legislative power, is the best venue in which to set forth such rules.

Despite the thrust of both the Constitution and the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) to highlight the important role of women in society and governance, our underrepresentation persists in the Parliament. This can be traced back to the peace process, up to the formulation of the organic law. In a study conducted by the United Nations on women’s participation in the peace process, it was found that during the formal talks in 1976 (Tripoli Agreement) and the years that followed, no woman was part of the peace panel. This changed in 1997, when a woman was made part of the peace negotiations. From then, there has been at least one woman appointed to the peace panel, up until the signing of the peace agreement and drafting of the Organic Law. However, despite having a seat at the table, representation still skews heavily in favor of men. According to projections by the Philippine Statistics Authority, about 50.04% of Bangsamoro residents are female, and yet only 15% of Parliament members are women.

Running for and surviving in office has always been daunting for women, as we face discrimination and beliefs that tend to limit our societal roles. We constantly face threats, violence harassment, and intimidation. We endure struggles in balancing private, family, and political life, and in gaining political and financial support. Hence, with the need for a more equitable representation for women in Parliament, it becomes all the more important to nurture and encourage the presence of women in key decision-making spaces, to advance and normalize gender equality.

To such an end, this bill seeks to establish a Women’s Caucus in Bangsamoro Parliament. The Caucus shall be a venue for women in Parliament to unite and consolidate representation, crossing political divides in order to develop and sharpen an agenda, and build and mobilize political consensus to achieve meaningful progress for women’s issues, gender equality, and gender development.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
