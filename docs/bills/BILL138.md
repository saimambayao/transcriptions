**AN ACT PROVIDING FOR SPECIAL REGIONAL INVESTMENT AND INCENTIVE CODE FOR HALAL-ORIENTED ENTERPRISES IN THE MUSLIM AUTONOMOUS REGION, INTEGRATING FOR THE PURPOSE, ALL EXISTING RELEVANT LAWS, POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES RELATIVE TO THE GRANTS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SAME, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.**

**Explanatory Note**

Section 13, R.A. 10817, otherwise known as Halal Industry Development Program, provides: "That the Board of Investments, the Philippine Economic Zone Authority, and other investment promotion agencies are hereby mandated to promote the growth of Halal industries in the different economic zones and strategic locations in the country. They shall, as their Charter allow, grant fiscal and non-fiscal incentives to attract investments in the pioneering and essential industries to increase exports..." This specific provision laid out the legal and policy precondition for takeoff of BARMM Halal Development Program. In the post pandemic era, we see increased mobility of capital that allow companies to restructure their business operations across various jurisdictions and to select countries that offer lower capital cost, ability to benefit from free trade and agreements and favorable tax incentives.

A Halal-friendly investment policy could boost BARMM's bid for a share of the world's halal market estimated to be worth more than $4 trillion. Among seventeen (17) regions in the country, only BARMM, through the Bangsamoro Board of Investment (BBOI) can give incentives to interested firms wanting to invest in new projects related to halal industry and Islamic Banking and Finance.

Development in the Halal food industry mark the beginning of a potentially huge market, fueled by a large, fast-growing global halal marketplace. Big players in the food industry are beginning to take notice of the booming halal food sector. With the presence of 2.8 billion people or 28.7% of the world population, Muslim consumers are a fast-growing segment that demand for products with halal guarantees. For BARMM to be capable to seize modest share of that huge market, it must invest on flagship program strategy to secure growth of foreign-oriented investments to set off a precursor for the surge of Halal-based industry economic enterprises on industrial scale in the region. In the context of this proposed bill, it is seen that Halal Tax Incentive program is an enticing magnet for inflows of foreign investments into the halal industry and key to capturing consumers trust and interest toward BARMM halal products and service.

This measure is a vital enabling component link and complementary to other major strategies working together to achieve BARMM economic growth target in the short and long term, namely: bill proposing for the establishment of Cross Border Halal Trade Corridor, Economic Zone Initiative which will house production and supply value chain for halal products, among others, Cross Border Barter Trade, Opening of Maritime Transit Route in the south, establishment of Transshipment Port and Entrepot Trade Terminal, creation of the BARMM Halal Board on the regulatory and policy side. All of these projects could contribute to the creation of market and production base which is competitive and economically integrated as driver in investment facilitation for trade, logistics and port facilities, foreign exchange earnings, free flow of goods and services, technology transfer and flow of capital.

In the end, BARMM has to face a challenge on how it can recreate itself as a regional economic player powered by its competitive advantage and position itself as attractive investment destination. Taking queue on lesson of many progressive ASEAN countries, tax incentive initiative is key element to launching a country's industrialization program which in turn helps propel in the attainment of its economic prosperity. As for the eleven million Filipino Muslims in the country, the surge in halal-producing industries in the region will provide steady source of supply of essential halal commodities, giving opportunities to Muslim to fulfill their religious obligation related to stringent requirement for food consumption.
