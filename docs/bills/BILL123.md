**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

*“And if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people.”*
– Quran (5:32)

Ensuring good health is one of the world’s top priorities. In fact, one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations is good health and well-being.

The Philippines recognizes, as one of its state policies, stated under Section 5, Article II of the 1987 Constitution, that “[t]he State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them.” In the Bangsamoro Region, Section 3, Article V, Republic Act No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) provides that as part of the general welfare of the people, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure, support, and promote the health and safety of its people.

These state policies with regard to health from the Constitution and the BOL need to be rigorously applied in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. The University Research Co., LLC (URC) of the United States names as one of the challenges in the region the “lack of equitable access to and weaknesses in the quality of health care.” Moreover, according to another article published by the World Bank titled “Advancing Universal Health Coverage in the Bangsamoro Region of the Philippines”, it was stated that one of the weakness in the provision of health services in the region was the “severely limited access to primary care services or none at all.” The article further stated that “there is a lack of human resources; doctors, nurses, and midwives; as well as basic amenities like electricity, communications equipment, and internet-enabled computers, to support health service provision. Substantial gaps in essential medicines also exist.”

To an extent, there is even the substantial lack of hospitals catering to the region. The lack of state-operated health facilities contributes to over half of the Filipino population having little to no access to primary health care facilities. As of 2018, over 60% of the 180,000 hospitals in the country are privately operated and are in urban areas. As a result, areas such as Municipality of Datu Blah T. Sinsuat are subject to the maldistribution of healthcare services.

The COVID-19 Pandemic has also posed an even greater obstacle in the provision of quality health care in the region. Despite having one of the strictest and longest lockdowns in the world, the cases brought by the COVID-19 pandemic revealed certain weaknesses in the country’s healthcare system. While both state-operated and private facilities are meant to be complementary, the pandemic highlighted and pressured the fragmented nature of the Philippine healthcare system. Thus, the lack of hospitals have resulted in facilities such as the Southern Philippines Medical Center (SPMC) having to cater to COVID-related cases for the entirety of Mindanao’s masses.

On October 28, 2022, Tropical Storm Nalgae, known in the Philippines as Severe Tropical Paeng, unleashed its fury in the Philippines and left many towns devastated, leaving its most awful effects in the province of Maguindanao del Norte. Unfortunately, the coastal municipality of Datu Blah Sinsuat was one of the places that were met with the worst of the tropical storm. A landslide and flash flooding wiped out many houses, properties, and livelihood and took many lives in the town. Phone lines and electrical posts and wires were destroyed. Roads and bridges connecting the towns of Datu Blah Sinsuat and its neighboring places were either destroyed or severely damaged, leading for them to be impassable. It was as if the town’s access to other places was severed, leading to its inaccessibility. As a result of this, there were a lot of cases of trapped victims and survivors in the different sitios and barangays.

Immediate disaster response to the fatalities encountered by the municipality and assistance from the outside could not be done. The tragedy left the town impenetrable. Worse, the local government of the municipality and its health response units did all of the best they could, but could not effectively respond to those who were badly affected and injured because they had no local hospital. With outside help being unable to reach them quickly enough, and with them unable to send the injured to the nearest hospitals, the municipality was paralyzed.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
