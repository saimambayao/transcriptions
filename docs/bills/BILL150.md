**AN ACT**
**STRENGTHENING THE BANGSAMORO AGRICULTURAL SUPPORT SYSTEM, THEREBY CREATING THE BANGSAMORO PLANT AND ANIMAL INDUSTRIES OFFICE (BPAIO), DEFINING ITS POWERS AND FUNCTIONS, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**Explanatory Note**

Article II, Section 4 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution specified that it is the prime duty of the Government to serve and protect the people. In congruence with this, the other principles and state policies stated in the said Constitution are geared toward the promotion of general welfare, significantly, the protection of the people, the promotion of the people’s right to health and the right to a clean and healthy environment. Therefore, it is the State’s duty and obligation to ensure the health, welfare, and safety of the present and future generation of the Filipinos.

The previous Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel F. Pinol said in a text message in response to a *Business World* query on May 2019 that the Bangsamoro’s “potential for food production is immense. In five years the Bangsamoro area will definitely be a major food producer for the country”, he also elaborated that they are expecting the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) to be a major food producer for the Philippines in five years. He noted that there are about 100,000 hectares of land suitable for high-value crops like Cavendish banana, pineapple, cacao, abaca, and hybrid coconut. While also detailing that there are emerging rice farms in the region, specifically found in the Liguasan Marsh along the Mindanao River basin and Lake Lanao in Lanao del Sur.

The Bureau of Animal Industry and the Bureau of Plant Industry was created in 1930 by virtue of Republic Act No. 3639. Since its creation, the Bureaus have gone through several organizational changes mandated by various Republic Acts, Presidential Decrees, and Executive Orders. Both are attached agencies under the purview of the Department of Agriculture, where both play a significant role in the over-all protection and development of the Plant and Animal Industries in the country.

The Bangsamoro, a newly created autonomous region in the part of Mindanao, is heavily dependent on agriculture as one of its sources of livelihood. The region covers 11,608 km² or 4.0 percent of the country’s land area, with a population of 4.12 million. The agriculture industry in the region should be protected to biosecurity threats like attacks from invasive species, pests, and diseases that can cause damage to the agricultural production. The region is also not spared from other possible threats or risks to its animals, plants, human population and its environment.

The Plant and Animal Industries may be affected with the outbreaks of communicable diseases coming from other parts of the world. Such vulnerabilities may threaten economic losses with far reaching effects. To minimize the effects of these threats and prevent the potential downfall of these plant and animal industries, the Bangsamoro Office of Plant and Animal Industries should be established in the region.

To ensure efficiency in planning and delivery of the programs for the industries in the region, there is a pressing need to establish an office that concentrates in the development of the industries in the region. The proposed Bangsamoro Plant and Animal Industries Office shall provide the overall policy and program directions of the industries in the region and shall coordinate the activities of government bodies to ensure the success of these industries. It shall also be responsible in promoting and maintaining the development of the said industries in the region.

The creation of the Plant and Animal Industries Office in the Bangsamoro Region is within maintaining the general welfare clause as stated in Section 3, Article V of R.A 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law in which the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
