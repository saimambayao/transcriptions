**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Section 21, Article IX of the Bangsamoro Organic Law states that the Bangsamoro Government recognizes science and technology as essential to national and regional progress. The Bangsamoro Government shall give priority to science, research, inventions, technology education, and their development. It shall ensure the full and effective participation of all sectors in the planning, programming, coordination, and implementation of scientific and technological researches. The Bangsamoro Government shall prioritize the acquisition, adoption, innovation, and application of science and technology for development.

As such, it highlighted the region’s recognition of the importance of scientific research and development (R&D) in the rebuilding of the region’s social and economic foundation. It is believed that any state that aspires to develop must embark on exploration, discovery, invention, and the continuous development of knowledge, techniques, and technologies already enjoyed.

As the Bangsamoro region rebuilds itself from the past conflict systems, several underlying social issues are brought to light. Issues such as poverty, disaster resilience, food security, climate change, cybersecurity, waste management, sustainable biodiversity, and most importantly in this state of COVID-19 pandemic, health. These are some of the many problems that require the attention of the Bangsamoro region, their impact are far-reaching and span to several generations. It is without a doubt that most, if not all, merit a scientific approach in resolving these overlapping and intertwining issues.

Scientific research and development is viewed as a tool for prevention as well as troubleshooting. Investing in R&D taps into the region’s potentials, especially its human resources. Apart from the aim of producing systems, products, and services to improve the quality of life, it creates an opportunity for talented and creative Bangsamoro to harness and improve their competence.

The creation of the Bangsamoro Research and Development Authority, proposed in this measure, will set the region’s directions and priorities in terms of scientific research policies. The establishment of this body is proof that the region is preparing itself for advancement, as it aims to develop industries and improve its economic resilience for the Bangsamoro People. This bill aims at creating an environment for coordination and collaboration between the government, its offices, the private sector, non-government organizations, and individuals engaged in research and development. It will provide institutional arrangements in promoting the use of science in the region.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
