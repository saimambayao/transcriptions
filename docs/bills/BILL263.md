**BTA BILL NO. 263**
(Private Member Bill)

The proposed Bangsamoro Electrification Administration Act of 2023 serves as a crucial and timely response to the prevailing challenges in the power sector within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). The region has long grappled with the dire consequences of an unstable power supply, which has not only hindered progress and development but has also significantly hampered the daily lives of its residents. It is paramount to underscore the dire necessity of improving rural electrification in the BARMM.

For an extended period, the people of BARMM have endured the crippling effects of inadequate and unreliable electricity access. This unremitting instability has exacted a heavy toll, affecting every facet of daily life, imposing barriers to educational opportunities, impeding access to essential healthcare services, and stifling the potential for robust economic growth. The undeniable and pressing truth is that the imperative to address these issues comprehensively and expeditiously cannot be overstated.

The legislative initiative before us is not merely a response to a local issue; it draws inspiration from the historical success of rural electrification initiatives at the national level in the Philippines. It aspires to replicate these successes within the specific jurisdiction of the BARMM. The Act, by empowering the Bangsamoro Electrification Administration (BEA) as a Government-Owned or - Controlled Corporation (GOCC), equips the region with the necessary tools and resources to promote and facilitate rural electrification, with a particular emphasis on underserved areas.

It is crucial to emphasize that rural electrification is not a mere aspiration but a fundamental necessity for the advancement of the BARMM. The region envisions fostering economic growth, improving living standards, and creating an environment conducive to investments and development. A stable and reliable power supply is not just a cornerstone of this vision; it is the very foundation upon which the BARMM can build a brighter, more prosperous, and electrified future.

Given the undeniable urgency and the transformative potential of this legislation, we strongly urge the approval of this bill. The necessity to improve rural electrification in BARMM cannot be delayed any further.
