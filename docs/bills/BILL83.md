**AN ACT**
**CREATING THE BANGSAMORO ECONOMIC ZONE AUTHORITY, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Ecozones are vital to the local and national economies, especially since we are in a pandemic. As a region, it is vital for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) to manage its economy well – and creating an ecozone authority will go a long way toward achieving that.

Republic Act No. 7916 provides that ecozones “are selected areas with highly developed or which have the potential to be developed into agro-industrial, Industrial tourist/recreational, commercial, banking, investment and financial centers.” Furthermore, an ecozone “may contain any or all of the following: Industrial Estates (IEs), Export Processing Zones (EPZs), Free Trade Zones, and Tourist/Recreational Centers.”

The Bangsamoro Region is an archipelagic region, with its ports and docks playing a big role not just in connectivity, trade, and jobs creation, but also in cultural pursuits. Considering the diversity present in the Bangsamoro region, ecozones will also serve as our window to the global market.

Under Article XIII, Section 28 of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) that created the BARMM covering “Economic Zones, Industrial Estates, and Free Ports,” the Bangsamoro Government “may establish economic zones, industrial estates, and free ports in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, including the establishment of a Bangsamoro Economic Zone Authority which shall have similar powers as those of the Philippine Economic Zone Authority. The Parliament may provide such additional powers and functions to the Bangsamoro Economic Zone Authority as may be necessary to meet the special circumstances of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.”

That same provision of the BOL states that, "Once the Bangsamoro Economic Zone Authority is created, the Philippine Economic Zone Authority shall no longer create any other economic zone within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region."

This provision of the BOL gives us power and is a testament to our self-rule.

With this, the approval of this bill is earnestly sought.
