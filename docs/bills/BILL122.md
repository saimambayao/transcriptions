**AN ACT**
**CREATING TWO (2) PARLIAMENTARY DISTRICTS IN THE SPECIAL GEOGRAPHIC AREA (63 BARANGAYS) OF THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION, INDICATING THEIR COMPOSITION, AND ALLOCATING TWO (2) SEATS THEREOF IN THE BANGSAMORO PARLIAMENT**

**INTRODUCTORY NOTE**

This proposed bill seeks to divide the Special Geographic Area (SGA) composed of sixty-three (63) barangays of North Cotabato that were annexed to the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) in the February 6, 2019 plebiscite into two (2) parliamentary districts, specifying the barangays that shall compose each district, and allocating corresponding two (2) seats thereof in the Bangsamoro Parliament.

The first SGA Parliamentary District will be composed of thirty-three (33) barangays with a total land area of 289.39 square kilometers, a population of 103,233 and an annual income of Php 120.66 million (Annex 1); while the second SGA Parliamentary District will be composed of twenty-nine (29) barangays with a total land area of 515.89 square kilometers, a population of 112,210 and an annual income of Php 125.17 million for 2nd SGA Parliamentary District as of 2020 (Annex 2).

The following are the provisions of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) which serve as the legal foundations of the proposed bill:

**BOL, Art. VII, Sec. 7 – Classification and Allocation of Seats** (pp. 17-18)

**(b) Parliamentary District Seats** – Not more than forty percent (40%) of the members of the Parliament shall be elected from single parliamentary districts apportioned for the areas and in the manner provided for by the Parliament. For the first parliamentary election following the ratification of this Organic Law, the allocation of the parliamentary district seats shall be determined by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority as provided for in Section 4, Article XVI of this Organic Law. In the allocation of district seats, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority shall adhere to the standards set in Section 10, Art. VII of this Organic Law.

The Parliament may undertake by law new redistricting in order to ensure a more equitable representation of the constituencies in the Parliament (p. 18).

The district representatives shall be elected through direct plurality vote by the registered voters in the parliamentary districts.

**BOL, Art. VII, Sec. 10 (p. 20). Redistricting for Parliamentary Membership.** – The Parliament shall have the power to reconstitute by law the parliamentary districts apportioned among the provinces, cities, municipalities, and geographical areas of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region to ensure equitable representation in the Parliament. The redistricting, merging, or creation of parliamentary districts shall be based on the number of inhabitants and additional provinces, cities, municipalities, and geographical areas, which shall become part of the Bangsamoro territorial jurisdiction.

For the purpose of redistricting, parliamentary districts shall be apportioned based on population and geographical area: *Provided, that each district shall comprise, as far as practicable, contiguous, compact, and adjacent territorial jurisdiction: Provided further, that each district shall have a population of at least one hundred thousand (100,000).*

**BOL, Art. XVI, Sec. 4. Functions and Priorities** – The Bangsamoro Transition Authority shall ensure the accomplishment of the following priorities during the transition period (p. 98):

(b) Determination of parliamentary districts for the first regular election for the members of the Parliament subject to the standards set in Section 10, Article VII of the Organic Law (p. 99).

The creation of two (2) parliamentary districts in the SGA-BARMM is essential as it provides the constituents with representatives who shall act for them in bringing up their sentiments to the legislative body; give assistance and advice to those in difficulty; act as lobbyists for local interest groups; play an active community role; and promote their policies to the community, among others. Thus, socio-economic development in the Area will become faster.

In cognizance of the foregoing, the undersigned deeply seeks the favorable support of the members of the Bangsamoro Parliament.
