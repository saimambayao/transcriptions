**AN ACT PROVIDING FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL IN THE CITY OF COTABATO, TO BE KNOWN AS BANGSAMORO CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**Explanatory Note**

In the heart of the Bangsamoro, where the laughter of children echoes through bustling streets and quiet homes, there exists a silent plea—one that calls for a sanctuary of healing, a refuge where the youngest and most vulnerable can find solace in their time of need. The proposed Bangsamoro Children’s Hospital (BCH) is not merely a structure of concrete and steel; it is a testament to a collective promise—that no child shall suffer for lack of care, that no parent shall endure the anguish of helplessness, and that the future of this land shall be built upon the foundation of health, hope, and unwavering compassion.

Across the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, countless families grapple with the harsh realities of limited healthcare access. Parents travel for hours, clutching feverish infants to their chests, only to find overcrowded clinics or hospitals unequipped for specialized pediatric care. Others watch helplessly as malnutrition and preventable diseases steal the vitality of their children, simply because the right treatment was beyond reach.

The statistics are sobering: high infant mortality rates, rising cases of vaccine-preventable illnesses, and the lingering specter of stunted growth due to inadequate nutrition. These are not just numbers—they are stories. Stories of a child who never saw their fifth birthday, of a mother who wept outside an overwhelmed emergency room, of a community that dreams of a day when their children need not beg for the basic right to health.

This legislation is more than a mandate—it is a covenant with the people. Under Section 2, the Bangsamoro Government declares its solemn duty to uphold the right to health for every child, recognizing that a nation’s strength lies in the well-being of its youngest citizens. The BCH, as outlined in Section 3, shall rise in Cotabato City as a beacon of hope—a 200-bed facility under the Ministry of Health, where every corridor, every ward, and every smile from a nurse is designed with children in mind.

But what truly sets this hospital apart is its mandate—a commitment not just to treat illness, but to nurture life in all its dimensions. Here, pediatricians will mend broken bones and battling infections, but they will also guide parents through prenatal care, ensuring that life begins with the best possible chance. Nutritionists will combat hunger not just with meals, but with education, empowering families to break cycles of malnutrition. Immunization programs will shield children from diseases that have no place in this modern age. And within its walls, parenting classes will transform anxious caregivers into confident nurturers, armed with knowledge to protect their children’s futures.

The hospital’s development goals reflect foresight and adaptability. The Ministry of Health will craft a roadmap—one that grows alongside the needs of the Bangsamoro people. Will 200 beds suffice? Perhaps for now, but the plan allows for expansion, for new wings and advanced equipment, for specialists yet to be trained. The staffing, the funding, the very blueprint of the BCH will evolve, ensuring that this institution never stagnates, never falls behind the march of medical progress.

And then, the vital question: How shall this vision be funded? Section 6 provides the answer—through the unwavering commitment of the Bangsamoro Government. The Ministry of Health will anchor the hospital’s needs in its budget, securing not just its birth, but its enduring mission. No child turned away for lack of money. No life deemed unworthy of investment.

To establish the Bangsamoro Children’s Hospital is to plant a seed—one that will grow into a forest of resilience, where future generations thrive under the canopy of good health. It is a declaration that in the Bangsamoro, children are not merely inheritors of the future; they are its architects.

Let this law be remembered not just as a policy, but as a turning point—the moment the Bangsamoro looked its children in the eye and said: You matter. You are seen. You are worth every effort, every peso, every dream we can muster.
