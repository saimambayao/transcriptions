**AN ACT**
**CREATING THE MINISTRY OF BANGSAMORO MIGRANT WORKERS, ESTABLISHING ITS POWERS AND JURISDICTION, AMENDING SECTIONS 14 TO 17, TITLE IX OF THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMY ACT NO. 13, PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

There is dignity in labor and the State places a premium upon it. Section 3, Article XIII of the 1987 Constitution provides that the State shall afford full protection to labor, local and overseas, organized and unorganized, and promote full employment and equality of employment opportunities for all. Moreover, under Section 18 Article II of the 1987 Constitution provides that the State affirms labor as primary social economic force. It shall protect the rights of workers and promote their welfare.

Many Filipinos believe that overseas employment is the way to financial security. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA),² the number of OFWs in 2021 was estimated at 1.83 million, which was higher than the 1.77 million estimates in 2020.

As stated in Senate Bill No. 969, as filed by Senator Grace Poe, "[being an Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) carries with it the challenge of being alone in a foreign land and missing important events in the lives of their loved ones back home in exchange for a high-paying job. Because of their desire to provide a better future for their children, however, they are left with no choice but to endure the hardships of working abroad with the uncertainty of the dangers they may have to face."³

OFWs are tagged as the modern-day heroes of our country as their billion-dollar remittances each year have helped in alleviating the Philippine economy from the effects of the global financial crisis. Each year, their remittances to the country contribute greatly to the country’s economic growth. However, several illegal practices have plagued this industry which affect OFWs everyday. It is a sad reality that not all OFWs have landed the jobs that they were promised or were hired for. Some OFWs arrive at their destination country only to find out that the job they were promised is non-existent or are placed in a job that they did not apply for. Moreover, some of them face difficult situations as they are abused by their employers, work longer hours, or get paid lesser than what is stated in their contract. Worse, some of them have been illegally recruited, and even worse, some of them have become the subjects of trafficking.

Working abroad is a big sacrifice. It is both physically and mentally agonizing, and even emotionally draining, to be separated from families for a long time without assurance of what lies ahead and what risks await abroad.⁴ Every now and then, we hear all sorts of horrible stories that our modern-day heroes have encountered. There have been an alarming number of reports of abuse of OFWs by employers who refuse paying salaries and stories about returning OFWs who still struggle to integrate themselves when they return abroad despite working there for so many years. In the worst turn of events, several OFWs return to the country as dead bodies as they have become victims of human trafficking, terrorism, calamities, poor working conditions, and unjust treatment. Despite all these and the increasing number of abuses and violence toward OFWs, a lot of Filipinos still aspire to work abroad.

The Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) was established and created under Republic Act No. 11641, otherwise known as the "Department of Migrant Workers Act", and signed into law by then President Rodrigo R. Duterte on December 30, 2021. The DMW serves as the government’s arm which is in charge of safeguarding the rights and promoting the welfare of OFWs and their families.

Currently, issues and concerns of the overseas Bangsamoro workers are being catered by the Ministry of Labor and Employment (MOLE). However, its powers and functions on the protection and promotion of the rights and welfare of the Overseas Bangsamoro Workers (OBWs) are limited.

The creation of Ministry of Bangsamoro Migrant Workers, as proposed in this legislative measure, can better ensure and afford full protection to the OBWs. Furthermore, it will ensure that the rights of the OBWs will not be compromised and violated. It shall be the primary policy, planning, coordinating, implementing, regulating, and administrating entity that will afford full protection and promote the welfare of all OBWs, documented and undocumented, and their families.

Thus, to ensure full and strong commitment in the protection of OBWs against abuses, violence, maltreatment, trafficking, imprisonment, and illegal migration, it is but proper to create and establish the Ministry of Bangsamoro Migrant Workers in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.

The Bangsamoro Government shall promote full employment and equality of employment opportunities for all. It shall provide adequate and timely social, economic and legal services to Bangsamoro migrant workers.

While recognizing the significant contribution of overseas Bangsamoro workers to the region’s economy though their foreign exchange remittances, the Bangsamoro government does not promote overseas employment as a means to sustain economic growth and achieve development. The existence of the overseas employment program rests solely on the assurance that the dignity and fundamental human rights, and freedom of the Bangsamoro, shall not, at any time, be compromised or violated. The Bangsamoro government, therefore, shall continuously create local employment opportunities and promote the equitable distribution of wealth and benefits of development.⁵
