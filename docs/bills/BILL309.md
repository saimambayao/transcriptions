**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The rights of the Settlers in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao are guaranteed by *Republic Act 11054* (The Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao). *Sections 6-7, Article IV* (General Principles and Policies) of this law particularly provides that “[t]he Bangsamoro Government shall promote unity, peace, justice, and goodwill among all peoples” and “shall ensure every Filipino citizen in its territorial jurisdiction the provision of the basic necessities and equal opportunities in life xxx.” *Section 10, Article IV* further provides that “[t]he freedom of choice of all people within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region shall be respected” and that “[t]here shall be no discrimination on the basis of identity, religion, and ethnicity.”

Some of the basic rights of the Settlers are also embodied under Article IX of *RA 11054*. A relevant and important provision of which is that on religious freedom. *Section 5* therewith provides that “[t]he Bangsamoro Government shall guarantee religious freedom and the free exercise thereof pursuant to the Constitution, national laws, and principles of International Law. The Bangsamoro Government shall protect all persons from harassment or any undue pressure, coercion, and violence on account of religion. Any establishment and institution shall be free to implement policies and undertake activities pursuant to their respective religious beliefs and values. Finally, *Section 15, Article IX* provides that “[t]he Bangsamoro Government shall ensure that settlers enjoy the rights guaranteed in this Organic Law” and that “[f]or this purpose, the Parliament shall create an office for settler communities to promote the welfare and address issues and concerns of settlers in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.”

However, despite the provisions of *RA 11054* that guarantee the rights of the Settlers in the BARMM, there are still misconceptions and misapprehensions among some Filipino citizens within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region with regard to the existence of the said rights or the belief of the lack thereof. For instance, there are tendencies among some misinformed individuals from both the Bangsamoro and the Settlers to believe that the lands owned and duly possessed or occupied by Settlers are now owned by the Bangsamoro government by virtue of the passage of the *Bangsamoro Organic Law*, and can accordingly be taken away by the latter even against the will of the former. Thus, there is still a need for a law that will recognize, define, elaborate and promulgate such rights.

Along this line, there is also a need to reinforce the existing Office for the Settler Communities that is created under the *Bangsamoro Autonomous Act No. 13*, or the *Bangsamoro Administrative Code* and to further promulgate the extent and the scope of its mandate, its powers and functions, as well its organization and composition. Based on its experiences and operations under its current setup for the past years since it was created under the *Bangsamoro Administrative Code*, the existing Office has encountered challenges and difficulties that have hampered its administrative and technical operations necessary in the implementation of its programs, activities and projects for the Settlers. With the ultimate goal of enabling it to become a more effective agency in fulfilling its mandate and in performing its powers and functions, as well as in implementing the said programs, activities and projects, it is a necessary for the Office to be strengthened and in particular, to bestow it with fiscal autonomy and expanding its administrative section to become an administrative and finance division, as well as the various offices under it. This necessarily entails the hiring of additional personnel but with this, together with the fiscal empowerment, it is believed that the OSC will be able to hurdle the said challenges and difficulties, thereby truly serving as the primary agency responsible in promoting the welfare and addressing issues and concerns of settlers in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

In addition, there is a need to change the name Office for Settler Communities to Office of Settlers’ Affairs. While *Section 15, Article IX* of *RA 11054* mandated that x x x “the Parliament shall create an office for settler communities to promote the welfare and address issues and concerns of settlers in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region,” the name of such office is not necessarily Office for Settler Communities. As can be seen from the quoted provision, the term “office for settler communities” is a generic or common name and not the proper name of the office as it was not capitalized therein. It merely mandated the Parliament to create an office for settler communities but the name of such office can be anything as long as it signifies that it is for the Settlers. Moreover, the preposition “for” may also be replaced with “of” to observe uniformity in the use of this preposition in other agencies or ministries in the BARMM such as the Office of Muslim Affairs or the Ministry of Indigenous Peoples’ Affairs. Thus, the name Office of Settlers’ Affairs is seen as a more appropriate name of the Office.

Finally, the term “Settlers” ought to be the term to use when referring to “settler communities” not merely for the sake of consistency but in accordance with the principle that only natural or juridical persons can possess rights. With this, settler communities cannot possess rights because they are neither natural nor juridical persons. On the one hand, the term “settler communities” refers to a group of persons who are settlers, but it does not refer to the individual natural persons. On the other hand, the said term does not refer to juridical persons that can exist only when created under applicable existing laws. In sum, while “settler communities” cannot possess any right, Settlers, however, are natural persons that can possess rights. Thus, the term Settlers is also the more appropriate term to use than settler communities. Along this line, the term “Settlers” is considered as a proper name denoting a particular people with distinct culture and religion. Thus, just like the terms “Bangsamoro People” and “Indigenous People,” or other terms such as Cebuanos, Ilonggos, Ilocanos, Maguindanaons or Maranaos, all of which are proper names denoting specific groups of peoples with distinct cultures and religions, the first letter of the term “Settler” is, henceforth, suggested to be capitalized.

As the main Author of this Bill, I enjoin the BTA Parliament to enact this priority legislation in order to contribute to the attainment of the BARMM Government’s mission of ensuring the necessary conditions for enduring peace and sustained socio-economic development suitable to the systems of life, needs, and aspirations of its peoples by providing services to communities, and ensuring multi-stakeholder participation. Accordingly, we will be able to promote an inclusive and meaningful governance in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, in the interest of its tri-people.
