**AN ACT**
**CREATING THE MINISTRY OF TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT, PROVIDING FOR ITS POWERS, STRUCTURE, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The enactment and ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law brought with it several unique and innovative institutional changes in the Bangsamoro Government, institutional changes which have not even been witnessed by any jurisdiction in any part of the country.

One of these changes was the establishment of the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education (MBHTE). As one of the fifteen primary ministries of the interim cabinet during the transition period by express provision of law, the MBHTE was a novel concept that integrated the formulation, planning, implementation, and coordination of all policies, plans, programs, and projects in all levels of education by a single government agency.

With the consequent passage of the Bangsamoro Administrative Code, this concept has been institutionalized in the BARMM. Hence, even after the transition period, the MBHTE will remain and shall be primarily responsible for policy formulation, implementation, and regulation of all programs and activities at all levels of both public and private learning institutions for basic, higher, and technical education.

Although a noble endeavor, this may overburden the Ministry. This proposed measure seeks to amend existing laws and reinforce the powers and organizational function of technical education in the region by turning it into an independent and separate Ministry.

When enacted, the proposed Ministry of Technical Education and Skills Development (MTESD) shall become the primary policy formulation, planning, coordinating, implementing, regulating, and administrative entity of the Bangsamoro Government for technical education and training and certification policies, plans, and programs.

This will truly encourage the full participation and mobilization of industry, labor, local governments, and technical-vocational institutions in the skills development of the region’s human resources.

A major thrust of the MTESD under this Act is the formulation of a comprehensive development plan for middle-level manpower of the region. Hence, the new Ministry is expected to provide policy directions for technical education and skills training that is responsive, effective, and efficient in implementing its programs towards yielding the highest impact on manpower development in various areas, industry sectors, and institutions in the BARMM.

With the proposed measure, technical education and skills development for the inhabitants of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region will be strengthened as an implementing and regulatory institution of the region’s technical and vocational sector.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
