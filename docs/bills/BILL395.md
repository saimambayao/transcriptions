**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

**AN ACT**
**AMENDING ARTICLE VII, SECTION 14 OF THE BANGSAMORO ELECTORAL CODE, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

The right of suffrage is a fundamental democratic right enshrined in the Constitution and guaranteed under the Bangsamoro Organic Law. To operationalize this right, the Bangsamoro Parliament enacted the Bangsamoro Electoral Code (Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 35), which governs the conduct of free, orderly, and credible elections in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).

Article VII, Section 14 of the Code provides that the official ballots shall include, aside from the name of all candidates, each candidate's photo or logo and a "None of the Above" (NOTA) option. However, the law does not provide for the legal effect of votes cast for NOTA, creating ambiguity that risks inconsistent implementation and potential abuse.

Without clarification, the inclusion of NOTA in the ballot may give rise to serious complications. First, if NOTA receives the plurality of votes, it could result in an electoral vacuum or even the declaration of a failure of election, despite the fact that the grounds for such declaration are limited under Section 6 of the Omnibus Election Code to violence, terrorism, fraud, or other analogous causes. Second, the lack of statutory guidance may expose the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), through the Bangsamoro Electoral Office (BEO), to allegations of grave abuse of discretion in determining the effect of NOTA votes.

A particularly pressing concern is its impact on the distribution of parliamentary seats to Regional Parliamentary Political Parties (RPPPs). The proportional representation system relies on the allocation of seats based on valid votes cast for accredited political parties. If NOTA votes are included in this computation, either a corresponding number of seats will remain unfilled, or such votes will be reallocated to political parties, thereby converting a deliberate rejection of all candidates into artificial support for political organizations. Both scenarios subvert the legitimate expression of the electorate and erode the integrity of representative democracy.

This bill, therefore, seeks to clarify that the NOTA option shall be recognized only for statistical and policy guidance purposes, without bearing upon the determination of winning candidates or the allocation of proportional representation seats. Furthermore, it affirms that NOTA votes shall not constitute a ground for declaring a failure of election, which remains confined to the causes expressly provided under national law.

The retention of NOTA, while statutorily limited, also serves as a deterrent against electoral fraud. By providing voters a lawful means to signify rejection of all candidates, it minimizes the incidence of blank ballots that may otherwise be susceptible to post-marking or tampering.

Through this measure, the Parliament ensures consistency with constitutional and national standards, preserves the sanctity of proportional representation, and strengthens both the credibility and integrity of the Bangsamoro electoral system.

Approval of this bill is earnestly sought.
