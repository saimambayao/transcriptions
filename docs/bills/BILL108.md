**AN ACT ESTABLISHING A LEVEL I GENERAL HOSPITAL IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF HADJI MUHTAMAD, PROVINCE OF BASILAN, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

It is mandated by the Constitution to ensure that all communities have access to quality and accessible healthcare. Consistent with this, the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao instructs the Bangsamoro Government to provide, maintain, and ensure the delivery of basic and responsive health programs towards its inhabitants. It further directs the regional government to adopt a policy on health that provides for a comprehensive and integrated health service delivery for its constituents.

Towards this end, this proposed measure seeks to establish a Level I General Hospital in the Municipality of Hadji Muhtamad, in the Province of Basilan.

The Municipality of Hadji Muhtamad is one of the four newly created municipalities by virtue of Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act No. 200. The municipality has ten barangays under its area of jurisdiction. It serves primarily as the linkage between the government and the local residents for the delivery of basic services and effective administration of all constituents in the most remote barangays within the municipality. It has 3,921 households with a total population of 26,867 individuals.

In the municipality, there is only one facility which offers all basic health services to all 26,867 residents of Hadji Muhtamad - the Hadji Muhtamad Rural Health Unit. Thus, in emergency cases and other health crises, it is crucial for patients to instead be transported to the nearest hospital or health center in neighboring municipalities by boat.

This difficulty in accessing the health care services in the Municipality of Hadji Muhtamad deprives the residents of their constitutional right to life, which includes the right to adequate and accessible health care. The prevailing principle recently adopted by 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Universal Health Coverage is a rights-based approach to health that requires health policies and programs to prioritize the needs of those furthest behind the first.

Hence, to give substance and spirit to the provision of the Philippine Constitution and the Bangsamoro Organic Law, there is an urgent need for the construction and establishment of Hadji Muhtamad Municipal Hospital, a measure that provides for Hadji Muhtamad’s constituents’ societal rights, and protects their individual basic rights to life.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
