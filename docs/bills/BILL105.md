**AN ACT**
**ESTABLISHING A LEVEL I GENERAL HOSPITAL IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF MALUSO, PROVINCE OF BASILAN, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Consistent with the policy of the State to promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them, the delivery of essential health services at affordable costs should be provided by the government and should remain unhampered at all times. Likewise, the mandate of the State to adopt an integrated and comprehensive approach to health development should be aligned with its responsibility to develop a healthy and alert citizenry.

Moreover, the Constitution emphasizes the responsibility of the State to enhance the delivery of health services to the people. To further pursue these objectives, this Act seeks to create a General Hospital in the Municipality of Maluso, Basilan.

The Municipality of Maluso is a BARMM component Local Government Unit within the Province of Basilan which is classified as a 4th class municipality. It is located on the western coast of Basilan and has a land area of 304.14 square kilometers, with twenty (20) barangays and about 5,907 Households.

At present, the residents of Maluso can barely easily access essential health services since the municipality only has one Rural Health Unit and fifteen (15) barangay health stations manned by one MOA-doctor, twelve (12) nurses and fifteen (15) barangay health workers. Thus, when the residents need essential hospital services, they have to travel to the neighboring municipality of Sumisip.

Imagine the time it takes for these residents to travel to the hospital and their plight of enduring long hours to avail of essential hospital services, which adds that much more to their financial burden. The inability to afford transportation to access hospital-based medical services denies these people the access to health care services that should be theirs by right, under the law.

It is for these reasons that the establishment of the Maluso General Hospital is necessary, and should be one of the priorities of the Bangsamoro government to delivery basic and accessible health services. This must be done as part of providing social services and protecting the health of the people. Delivering health services that are easily accessible at an affordable cost in times of health emergencies, especially during this pandemic and for under-privileged Bangsamoro constituents, is vital to establishing a lasting peace, ensuring progress and maintaining the progress and gains of the people and the government.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
