**AN ACT**
**INSTITUTIONALIZING BARTER TRADE IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION, PROMOTING ITS GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND CONSTITUTING THE BANGSAMORO BARTER TRADE BOARD FOR THE PURPOSE**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

"Sell gold for gold and silver for silver, wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates and salt for salt, of the same kind for the same kind, of the same quantity for the same quantity, and the same quality from hand to hand, and if they differ from each other in quality, sell them as you like but from hand to hand." ¹

Barter has found its way into many languages as a term for the earliest form of exchange, which means the exchange of goods for goods without the medium of cash payments. The early trading methods were reciprocal, and the bilateral relationship was based upon personal ties and mutual trust, benefit, and balance.

The domestic barter trade policy has been recognized by the present administration by virtue of Executive Order No. 64 issued by President Rodrigo Roa Duterte on October 29, 2018. No less than the President of the Republic of the Philippines acknowledged barter trading as an ancient commercial practice among the Filipino people in the Southern Philippines, and its revival will not only create jobs and business opportunities but also strengthen trade and commerce between and among member-states of the Brunei Indonesia Malaysia Philippines East Asian Growth Area (BIMP EAGA).

It is a tradition that bonafide resident traders in the Sulu Archipelago and the Bangsamoro region, by reason of geographical proximity, historical and social ties, are from time immemorial engaged in commercial intercourse with these neighboring islands. The region became a major barter trading site long before the Spaniards came, with the Tausug establishing ties with their Southeast Asian neighbors and Chinese and European traders. The majority of the people living in those areas depend upon such trade as their principal means of livelihood and source of income.

Trade, through the barter system, flourished in the Sulu Sultanate, which used to include the islands that are now the provinces of Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, and Basilan. Merchants of Sulu and nearby areas traded with neighboring sultanates. Moreover, it was chronicled that there already existed a vibrant exchange of goods between lowland and upland communities, as well as between islands and regions.

In order to attain the foregoing objectives, it is necessary to liberalize the procedure for entrance and clearance of cargoes and vessels of bona fide Filipino residents who are engaged in such trade. Thus, these links will be revived, premised on the old ties that merely need reviving, jumping off from efforts to restart these two decades ago under the BIMP EAGA.

Economic development and growth in these areas will ensure long-term stability and order, as the people will feel the benefits in terms of jobs, income, and a better life for themselves and their families. It is also what will consolidate the peace process in Mindanao.

The barter trade as previously practiced has weaknesses, such as the absence of border agreements that make border patrols problematic, and the problem of transshipment of goods outside barter trade zones which the bill seeks to address. These weaknesses, however, are outweighed by the opportunity given to local traders to engage in profitable business activity. It will also benefit hundreds of workers, such as support workers, dock handlers, stevedores, and supports trucking firms, restaurants, and domestic tourism.

In the hopes of the swift passage of this bill, the principal rule on trading which was introduced by the Holy Qur'an and the Prophet (PBUH) of an understanding among Muslims must be highlighted and serve as a guiding principle to us all - that the morality of business is one of the factors in trading characteristics. It is clear from the verses of the Holy Qur'an which provided: "Give just measure and cause no loss (to others by fraud). And weigh with scales true and upright. And withhold not things justly due to men, nor do evil in the land working mischief."

The initiative to promote the development of this region, including the parts of Indonesia, Malaysia (Sabah), and Brunei close to it through the BIMP-EAGA can be promising if carried out. This used to be an economically vibrant region and can be again, with Mindanao, and subsequently the BARMM, benefitting from the renewal of historical trading ties, the joint exploitation of the area's vast marine resources, and economic cooperation.

In view of the foregoing, approval of this bill is earnestly sought.
