**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The right to health is a basic human right recognized nationally and internationally. This is enshrined in the 1987 Philippine Constitution and in the Bangsamoro Organic Law. In furtherance of this fundamental right, the Philippine Congress passed and enacted Republic Act No. 7719 or the National Blood Services Act of 1994 to promote voluntary blood donation and ensure safe transfusion of blood.

In healthcare, donating blood is essential to carry out life-saving procedures and treatment. It is not only mandated by law but also encouraged in Islam to support people in need. In fact, the Holy Qur'an, in Surah 5:32, provides that saving a life is akin to saving the entire mankind.

However, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, a region that is predominantly Muslim, continues to be plagued by an inadequate human blood supply. In fact, according to the Regional Health Office as of June 2025, a thirty-two percent (32%)¹ shortage of blood supply has been reported in the region. Such shortages could directly impact healthcare, potentially leading to the postponement or delay of surgeries, increased risks for patients undergoing major procedures, and even resulting in fatalities.

Thus, this bill is introduced to strengthen and sustain a safe, adequate, and accessible supply of human blood throughout the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao by promoting voluntary blood donation, providing for an adequate supply of safe blood and regulating blood banks.

It encourages voluntary blood donation by providing non-monetary incentives and seeks to establish the Bangsamoro Blood Services Program, which is a coordinated system of blood centers to ensure a safe, sufficient, and equitable blood supply across the BARMM region and lessen difficulties encountered about blood donation requests.

The bill encourages organized and sustained public education campaigns to strengthen community awareness. For areas without blood banks, it introduces a "walking blood donor" system to ensure people can still donate when needed. Safety, training, and funding rules are established to maintain the system's effectiveness and trustworthiness.

Passing this bill supports BARMM's goals for better healthcare, reduced reliance on paid blood sources, and increased community awareness of the importance of blood donations in saving lives.

Chunk Complete. Ready for next group of provisions starting at the Title of the Act.
