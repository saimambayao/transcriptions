**“AN ACT CREATING THE BANGSAMORO COMMISSION OF SENIOR CITIZENS UNDER THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MINISTER, PROVIDING POWERS AND MANDATES, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES”**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

All of us will turn 60 years old and become a senior citizen.

“It was once said that the moral test of the government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped.”

*   Inspirational Quotes from Hubert H. Humphrey

“Anyone who recognizes the high status of old people and respects them, God will save him from experiencing the might and fear of the Resurrection Day.”

- Source from Imam Jafar al Sadiq (a.s) lecture

The National Government enacted the law RA 11350 Section 6, also known as the “National Commission of Senior Citizens Act”, shall be under the Office of the President. The Commission is mandated to ensure the full implementation of laws, policies, and programs of the government on senior citizens, review and conduct related studies, and recommend policy to Congress and the President. It abolishes the National Coordinating and Monitoring Board created under RA 9994 and transfers related functions from the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) to National Commission of Senior Citizen.

Further, RA 9994, also known as the Expanded Senior Citizens Act of 2010, stated in Article XIII, Section 11 that “the State shall adopt an integrated and comprehensive approach to health development which shall endeavor to make essential goods, health and other social services available to all the people at affordable cost. There shall be priority for the needs of the underprivileged, sick, elderly, disabled, women and children”.

Also, Article XV, Section 4 of the 1987 Constitution declares that it is the duty of the family to take care of its elderly members while the State may design programs of social security for them.

Thus, this bill seeks the Bangsamoro Government to approve an established mechanism for the beloved senior citizens.
