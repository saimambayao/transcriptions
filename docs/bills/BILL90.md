**DECLARING JUNE 6 AS THE ANNUAL SIMULTANEOUS CLEAN-UP DAY IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO**

**Explanatory Note**

Section 3, Article V of Republic Act No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law provides that "[t]he Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants." The Bangsamoro Government has a pivotal role in protecting the environment within the region through the implementation of effective environmental policies.

The Department of Environment and Resources (DENR) recognized the need to clean the environment by implementing Republic Act No. 9003, otherwise known as the “The Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000”. This law ensures the protection of public health and the environment.

In response to the COVID-19 Pandemic, there are thousands of extra medical wastes that has put an additional burden to the environment and threatened human and environmental health. The CCC (Climate Change Commission) stressed that there should be increased awareness on waste due to the production and consumption of personal protective equipment (PPE), face masks, gloves, and other COVID-related supplies, which may end up as litter in waterways and our oceans. In this regard, the CCC calls on national and local authorities and citizens in implementing the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000, which requires practices on effective waste management—such as segregation of garbage at source, segregated transportation, processing, treatment, and proper disposal of solid waste—beginning from the home and extending to all levels of society.

This bill prescribes June 6, annually, as the Simultaneous Clean-Up Day in BARMM to heighten the consciousness of every Bangsamoro on the importance of preserving our environment. This can be achieved by raising awareness on the effects of littering and implementing programs and activities that aim in preventing pollution within the region. In order to protect and advance the right of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology, public participation must be encouraged.

Institutionalizing a clean-up day annually is one way of mobilizing massive voluntary action in support of the region’s clean-up and greening activities wherein garbage reduction, recycling, and rehabilitation of the region would be observed by various sectors of society. When we have access to clean and safe outdoor spaces, the quality of life improves. We all have an obligation to protect our environment and do our best to keep it clean, not only for ourselves, but for those who will descend us. After all, this is the only place we have.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
