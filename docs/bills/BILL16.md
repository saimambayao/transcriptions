**AN ACT**
**CREATING THE BANGSAMORO COMMISSION ON HIGHER EDUCATION, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The creation of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) was part of a broad agenda of reforms to the country’s education system outlined by the Congressional Commission on Education (EDCOM) in 1992. Part of the reforms was the trifocalization of the education sector into three governing bodies: the CHED for tertiary and graduate education, the Department of Education (DepEd) for basic education, and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) for technical-vocational and middle-level education.¹

Since its establishment, the CHED has played a significant role in developing human resources, bridging the gap between the skills set of the country’s workforce and the demands of employers in all specialized fields, and ensuring that the higher education system is locally responsive yet globally competitive.

Through Executive Order No. 315, s. 1996, the powers and functions pertaining to higher education in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region were devolved and transferred from the CHED to the Bangsamoro regional government. This transfer was made to ensure the full and expeditious devolution of powers necessary for the governance of the autonomous government.²

Section 16, Article IX of the Bangsamoro Organic Law provides that it shall be a priority of the Bangsamoro Government to establish, maintain and support a complete and integrated system of quality education, which shall be a subsystem of the national education system. The Bangsamoro Government shall develop an educational framework relevant and responsive to the needs, ideals, and aspirations of the Bangsamoro people. For this purpose, the Bangsamoro Government shall conform to the minimum standards set by the National Government.

Pursuant to the aforecited policy, this bill seeks to create the Bangsamoro Commission on Higher Education. The creation of this separate and independent regional commission shall provide more focused attention to higher education in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

It shall be the institution primarily responsible to administer, supervise, and promote higher education in the BARMM, as well as degree-granting programs in all higher educational institutions (HEIs) in the region, including State Universities and Colleges (SUCs), CHED-Supervised HEIs, Private HEIs, Islamic Higher Education, and transnational higher education institutions in the BARMM.

The Commission shall be composed of academicians who have been actively engaged in higher education and are thus equipped with the knowledge and experience needed to aid the formulation of BARMM development plans, policies, priorities, grants, and programs on higher education.

It shall likewise ensure the alignment of BARMM higher education at the national level, as well as safeguard accessible quality higher education in the BARMM through expanded scholarship programs and grants. With its creation, the Bangsamoro Government can significantly help surface the unique needs, aspirations, urgencies, and dynamics of the region in terms of addressing higher education gaps in services. Ultimately, it will help develop and pass regional policies, programs, and projects for the benefit of the Bangsamoro.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
