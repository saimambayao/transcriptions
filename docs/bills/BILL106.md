**UPGRADING THE LAMITAN DISTRICT HOSPITAL TO A LEVEL II HOSPITAL, INCREASING ITS BED CAPACITY, UPGRADING ITS PROFESSIONAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND FACILITIES, AUTHORIZING THE INCREASE OF ITS MEDICAL PERSONNEL, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Republic Act 11054, or the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, mandates the Bangsamoro Government to adopt a policy on health that provides for a comprehensive and integrated health service delivery for its constituents. It shall establish by law a general hospital system to serve the health requirements of its people and ensure that the individual basic right to life shall be attainable through the prompt intervention of excellent and affordable medical services.

In addition, Republic Act No. 11223, or the Universal Health Care Act of 2018 declares that the State shall adopt a health care model that provides all Filipinos access to a comprehensive set of quality and cost-effective, promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative, and palliative health services without causing financial hardship, and prioritizes the needs of the population who cannot afford such services.

Consistent with the above provisions, this proposed measure aims to upgrade the apex or end-referral hospital to protect and promote the right to health of the citizens of the City of Lamitan and its surrounding areas.

The Ediborah P. Yap Memorial Hospital, otherwise known as the Lamitan District Hospital, was established in 1976. In 1984, when Lamitan was still a municipality in the Province of Basilan, the hospital was renamed as the Lamitan District Hospital by virtue of Batas Pambansa Blg. 713, and is operating as level-1 medical facility, with a 25-bed capacity.

As the only government hospital operating in Lamitan City, the catchment area of Lamitan District Hospital covers the western half of the Province of Basilan, which has a population of 100,150 individuals across eight municipalities.

Currently, the Lamitan District Hospital is staffed by four permanent physicians, including the Chief of Hospital, and six job order doctors. The physicians are supported by seven nurses, including the Chief Nurse, and twenty nursing attendants.

However, there is a clear disparity in nurse-to-patient ratio and a sizeable lack of medical facility, equipment, and support staff to effectively cater and treat the hospital’s admitted patients. In 2014, the hospital recorded a total admission of 2,127 patients, which is 62.46% higher than its rated capacity. In 2018, hospital admissions rose dramatically to 4,258, or 172.1% and recorded constant increases up to 199.57% of its capacity, with a total admission of 4,601 in 2019.

The rising trend of admitted patients from 2014 to the first quarter of 2019 was recorded at four times the hospital’s rated capacity. Daily admissions alone placed the number of patients from 60 to 70 patients, which significantly surpasses its holding and serving capacity. Under these existing conditions, the hospital’s ability to provide much-needed medical care for the people within its zone of operations is in jeopardy of failing from lack of capacity, resources and manpower.

Hence, the present state of the hospital has affected its capability to effectively and efficiently attend to the needs of the patients: It severely lacks the required medical facilities, equipment and supplies, and medical and support staff to address the needs of its patients. The foregoing circumstances surrounding the Lamitan District Hospital reveal the urgent need to upgrade its capability and capacity for it to effectively serve the patients in its catchment area at a level of efficiency that will save more lives.

With the intent of keeping the hospital prepared amidst increasing rates of patient admissions and through the continuous increases in demand for its healthcare services, we propose enhancing the capacity and capability of the Lamitan District Hospital, upgrading it from its present 25 bed-capacity to a 100 bed-capacity. Hence, this proposal.

In view of the stated policy of the BARMM government to provide for comprehensive and integrated health service delivery to its constituents, it is a matter of utmost consideration and urgency for this government to enact a law that will address these health concerns and challenges.

In view of the foregoing, approval of this bill is earnestly sought.
