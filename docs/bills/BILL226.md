**AN ACT ESTABLISHING CANCER CARE CENTER AND A CANCER ASSISTANCE FUND FOR BANGSAMORO REGION INDIGENTS AND PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**Explanatory Note:**

This proposed bill, titled the "Bangsamoro Cancer Care Center Act," aims to address the critical necessity of establishing a cancer care center in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. The bill acknowledges the significant challenges faced by cancer patients and their families, particularly due to the limited availability of specialized healthcare services within the region.

The presence of a cancer care center in the Bangsamoro region holds immense importance. It is disheartening to observe that a majority of our brothers and sisters in the Bangsamoro region suffer from cancer, and due to poverty and lack of access to a cancer care center, they often choose, even if it hurts, not to seek treatment. This reality breaks our hearts and underscores the urgent need to provide accessible and comprehensive cancer care within our region.

Currently, individuals in need of cancer treatment often have to travel to distant cities like Davao, Zamboanga, or Cagayan De Oro, resulting in various obstacles such as financial constraints, travel expenses, and separation from support networks. This situation disproportionately affects indigent constituents who lack the resources required for timely and adequate treatment.

The primary objective of this bill is to establish a dedicated Cancer Care Center within the Bangsamoro region, which will serve as a specialized hospital offering comprehensive services, including diagnosis, treatment, care, rehabilitation, and relief. By providing these services locally, the bill aims to alleviate the burdens faced by patients, eliminating the need for arduous and costly journeys to distant cities.

A significant area that has been neglected due to the absence of a cancer care center is the provision of specialized medical services. By establishing the Center within the region, this bill aims to bridge the gap in healthcare access, ensuring that residents receive timely and appropriate cancer treatments. Moreover, the bill emphasizes the importance of supporting indigent constituents by providing affordable and accessible healthcare services to those most in need.

Additionally, the bill introduces a Cancer Assistance Fund, which will be allocated to offer financial support and assistance to indigent Bangsamoro constituents seeking cancer treatment. This provision ensures that individuals are not deprived of care due to financial limitations, emphasizing the bill's commitment to equity and inclusivity.

In conclusion, the passage of this bill is crucial to address the absence of a dedicated Cancer Care Center in the Bangsamoro region. It acknowledges the challenges faced by cancer patients and their families due to geographical barriers, poverty, and limited access to healthcare services. The bill recognizes the urgent need to support indigent constituents in their journey towards recovery and aims to bring hope, relief, and improved healthcare services to the Bangsamoro people. By establishing a cancer care center within the region, this bill fulfills their long-awaited right to accessible and comprehensive cancer care, addressing the heart-wrenching reality faced by our fellow Bangsamoro citizens.

Based from the foregoing, the approval of this bill is urgently requested.
