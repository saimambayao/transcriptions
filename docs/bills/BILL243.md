**AN ACT AUTHORIZING AND PROMOTING PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS (PPP) IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM), ESTABLISHING THE REQUIREMENTS, STANDARDS, AND PROCEDURE THEREFOR, AND OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) charter recognizes the pivotal role of the private sector as the driving force behind trade, commerce, and industry, and encourages collaboration with private entities in key sectors, including housing and education. In line with this vision, this proposed legislation titled "An Act Authorizing and Promoting Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM)" seeks to establish a comprehensive framework for harnessing the potential of PPPs to fuel the region's development and enhance the lives of its constituents.

Presently, the BARMM stands at a critical juncture in its economic and developmental trajectory. While strides have been made, there remains untapped potential that requires innovative strategies. This proposed law comes at a time when the BARMM is making remarkable strides in economic growth, development, and innovation. The region envisions itself as a dynamic economic giant, primed to contribute significantly to the nation's progress. This proposed legislation aligns with this vision, providing a strategic platform for the BARMM to leverage its resources, optimize its capabilities, and drive its development agenda forward.

In various locales and regions across the world, PPPs have demonstrated their capacity to deliver improved, cost-effective, and timely services to communities, fostering inclusive growth that uplifts the quality of life for all. This proposed law stems from the BARMM's commitment to development and its strategic framework, aiming to instill performance-based management in public service delivery while aligning with commercial principles and incentives. This approach recognizes the diverse needs of users and stakeholders, ensuring that services are tailored to meet the unique demands of the Bangsamoro people.

The essence of this proposed law lies in its potential to optimize the utilization of resources, redirecting capital budgets to other pressing sectors by avoiding the costs associated with public borrowing. A central objective is to facilitate technology transfer from the private sector, leveraging their expertise and experience to enrich the capacity of local governance. Through PPPs, BARMM will be better poised to accelerate its development agenda, with an eye toward sustainable growth and progress.

This proposed law empowers BARMM to adopt a range of viable PPP modalities for various developmental projects spanning energy and power, public infrastructure, transportation, telecommunications, environmental conservation, health facilities, education, disaster management, and other priority sectors. The envisioned framework goes beyond the mere establishment of partnerships; it outlines a comprehensive regulatory, economic, legal, and logistical structure. It ensures that all stakeholders are held accountable while adhering to principles of competition, data privacy, and transparency, in line with global best practices.

One of the most significant merits of this proposed law is the far-reaching benefit it holds for the Bangsamoro people. The BARMM will unlock access to advanced technologies, efficient management practices, and a wealth of expertise from the private sector, enhancing the region's capabilities to provide quality services. Additionally, by engaging in PPPs, BARMM can channel its resources toward sectors that demand immediate attention, bolstering the overall well-being of its constituents.

Furthermore, this proposed law envisions a promising future for the BARMM. It sets the stage for sustainable development, enhanced service delivery, and economic resilience. Through PPPs, the BARMM can tap into innovative solutions to address complex challenges, fostering an environment conducive to prosperity and progress. This legislation stands as a testament to the BARMM's commitment to creating a better future for its people by embracing the transformative potential of public-private partnerships.

Given the spirit of cooperation, innovation, and progress that underpins this proposed law, it is believed that its passage will pave the way for the BARMM to emerge as a model of effective governance, sustainable development, and prosperity in the years to come. Insha’Allah!

Based from the foregoing, the approval of this bill is urgently requested.

**AN ACT AUTHORIZING AND PROMOTING PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS (PPP) IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM), ESTABLISHING THE REQUIREMENTS, STANDARDS, AND PROCEDURE THEREFOR, AND OTHER PURPOSES**

**Chapter 1. Basic Principles and Definitions**

**SECTION 1. Short Title.** – This Act shall be known as the “BARMM PPP Law.”

**Sec. 2. Declaration of Policy.** – It is hereby declared as a policy that BARMM shall advance the welfare and interest of all Bangsamoro people and other inhabitants of the BARMM, by entering into partnerships with the private sector to better enable it to raise funds to support the various needs of its members and other benevolent purposes as are consistent with Republic Act No. 11054 or the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.

**Sec. 3. Operative Principles.** – The accomplishment of the stated policy shall be guided by the following principles:

(a) The BARMM, pursuant to Sections 1, 2 and 5, Article X of the 1987 Constitution, is a territorial and political subdivision which enjoys local autonomy and fiscal autonomy. Under Section 3, Article X of the 1987 Constitution, local autonomy means a more responsive and accountable local government structure instituted through a system of decentralization. Fiscal autonomy means that local governments have the power to create their own sources of revenue in addition to their equitable share in the national taxes released by the national government, as well as the power to allocate their resources in accordance with their own priorities.

(b) The general welfare and the public good shall always be promoted and that transparency, public accountability and social accountability mechanisms and approaches shall be integrated in PPP from inception to implementation.

(c) The BARMM exists and operates in its governmental and proprietary capacities thereby making the BARMM an agent of, and is therefore accountable to, the State and its community. The role of the BARMM both as a regulator of a business and as implementer of a proprietary undertaking must be clearly delineated.

(d) The BARMM must develop into a self-reliant community, and as such, is in a better position to address and resolve matters that are local in scope. The BARMM is under the supervision of the President and under the qualified control of Congress.

(e) Under the charter of the BARMM, the Regional Government recognizes the private sector as the prime mover of trade, commerce, and industry and encourages cooperation with the private sector in specific sectors, including housing and education. The Regional Government is further mandated to evolve a system of economic agreements and trade compacts to generate block grants for regional investments and improvements of regional economic structures, which shall be authorized by law enacted by the Regional Assembly.

(f) The Bangsamoro Economic and Development Council (BEDC), serving as the planning, monitoring, and coordinating agency for all development plans, projects, and programs intended for the autonomous region, evaluates and recommends for approval by the Regional Assembly, the annual work programs and comprehensive development plans of the autonomous region. Once approved, it shall be the duty of the Regional Governor to ensure the proper implementation of the said annual work programs and comprehensive development plans.

(g) PPP shall be pursued by BARMM consistent with its infrastructure, development, investment, environmental and governance framework embodied in relevant policies, plans, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.

(h) BARMM, as a partner in a PPP arrangement, may provide equity, subsidy or guarantee and use its own funds; and the usage thereof for a PPP project shall be considered for public use and purpose.

(i) The right of the people to information on matters of public concern is guaranteed under Section 7, Article III of the 1987 Constitution. Furthermore, it is the policy of the State to allow full public disclosure of all its transactions involving public interest such as PPP under Section 28, Article II of the 1987 Constitution.

(j) The people’s right to effective and reasonable participation and public trust provision under Section 16, Article XIII and Section 1, Article XI, respectively, of the 1987 Constitution guarantee and empower civil society organizations (CSOs) to have effective and meaningful participation in the regulation and management of PPP projects.

**Sec. 4. Rationale for PPP.** – PPP shall be promoted to provide more, better, affordable and timely services to the community, facilitate inclusive growth and promote better quality of life of the Bangsamoro people and other inhabitants of BARMM. In pursuing PPP, BARMM shall be guided by the following reasons and drivers:

(a) PPP shall be undertaken in furtherance of BARMM’s development and physical framework plan.

(b) PPP is an essential part of the overall infrastructure reform policy of BARMM. By encouraging performance-based management of the delivery of public services applying commercial principles and incentives whenever possible, by introducing competition in and for the market, and by involving users and stakeholders in the decision-making process, the infrastructure and regulatory reform objectives of BARMM shall be achieved.

(c) PPP should be adopted to address a pressing and urgent or critical public need. Under the principle of “Additionality,” the increased economic benefits to consumer welfare of having needed public services and infrastructure accessible now because of PPP, rather than having to wait until BARMM could provide the public services much later. PPP will also promote the accelerated implementation of projects.

(d) PPP can be adopted to avoid costs and public borrowing. By contracting with the private sector to undertake a new infrastructure project, scarce BARMM capital budgets can be directed to other priority sectors such as social services, education, and health care.

(e) PPP allows for technology transfer, and improved efficiency and quality of service. These could be a valuable contribution of the private sector in local governance.

(f) PPP should be feasible and affordable, demonstrating the need for the project, broad level project costs estimation, and indicative commercial viability. The assessment of affordability shall be the cornerstone for all PPP projects, both to BARMM and the general public.

(g) PPP Projects should be bankable. High participation costs, unreasonable risk transfer or lengthy and complex contract negotiations must be avoided. A cost recovery pricing policy attractive to the private sector must be in place; provided that the same will not be disadvantageous to government and public interest.

(h) PPP Projects should provide value-for-money and good economic value as far as practicable, including allocation of risks to the party best able to control, manage, mitigate, or insure these risks, and maximization of the benefits of private sector efficiency, expertise, flexibility, and innovation.

(i) PPP Projects must provide economic and social benefits and should be evaluated on this basis rather than on purely financial considerations. BARMM remains responsible for services provided to the public, without necessarily being responsible for corresponding investment.

(j) PPP Projects must give consideration for empowerment of the Bangsamoro people and other inhabitants of the BARMM, as a strategy for economic growth and sustainability and must thus provide for the participation of local investors to the furthest extent practicable given the nature of the project. BARMM shall also ensure the hiring and employment of local labor in the PPP venture.

(k) Procurement of PPP Projects must be competitive and must be undertaken through open competitive bidding. Competition must be legitimate, fair, and honest. In the field of government contract law, competition requires, not only bidding upon a common standard, a common basis, upon the same thing, the same subject matter, the same undertaking, but also that it be legitimate, fair, and honest; and not designed to injure or defraud the government. Where competitive bidding cannot be applied, a competitive process ensuring both transparency and economically efficient outcome must be employed.

(l) The regulation of the PPP shall be pursuant to the PPP contract and exercised by the appropriate regulatory authority. A duly executed and legal PPP contract shall be respected and not impaired and shall be binding on the successor administration pursuant to the provision on corporate succession. Procedures, activities, and steps duly undertaken by the Chief Minister, the BEDC, and the PPP-SC, pursuant to this Act shall be continued by the successor administration. Any amendment or revision to this Act by the next administration shall not in any way prejudice vested and contractual rights of BARMM and the PSPs as to the substance of agreements signed, certifications issued, resolutions issued and procedures undertaken.

(m) To provide efficient public service, BARMM must ensure, through stronger performance management and guidance, proper implementation of PPP contracts that will result in value for money, on-time delivery of quality services to the public, achievement of government policy goals, all within sustainable and integrated development.
