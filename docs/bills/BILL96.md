**AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ANNEX BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT CENTER (BGC) OF THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT WITHIN COTABATO CITY, PROVIDING FUNDS THEREOF, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**Explanatory Note**

Article VII, Section 1 of R.A. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law provides:

> Section 1. *Seat of Government.* – The Parliament shall fix by law the permanent seat of the Bangsamoro Government anywhere within the territorial jurisdiction of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region taking into consideration accessibility and efficiency in which its mandate may be carried out under this Organic Law.

The Bangsamoro Government Center, or locally known as BGC, located at Governor Gutierrez Avenue, Rosary Heights VII, Cotabato City, Maguindanao, has been around for decades now. Back then, it was still known as the Office of the Regional Governor (ORG) Compound, the seat of government of the defunct Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), even when Cotabato City was still not part of the said autonomous region. It housed the departments, offices, and agencies of the ARMM.

With the transition from ARMM to the now Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), the current seat of government has remained in the said city, which is now part of the latter autonomous region. However, over the years, the government center has become too packed or congested. Several factors have led to this:

*First*, with the overhaul of the autonomous government and the creation of new ministries, offices, and agencies, several offices have been transferred from one building to another, and some offices have even occupied two buildings due to the unavailability of space.

*Second*, the 80 members of parliament (MPs) each have their own office and have occupied the offices in the former Regional Legislative Assembly Building, now the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) Building. Other offices of the MPs have even scattered in different parts of the government center, such as in the Datu Kabilan Sema Hall and the Shariff Kabunsuan Cultural Center. An annex building has even been created in De Mazenod Avenue for the other MPs, but there is still a scarcity of space, leading other MPs to rent out spaces in commercial buildings in the city.

*Third*, some national offices remain in the government center, such as the Department of Health Region XII, Department of Science and Technology (DOST), National Food Authority (NFA), and the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI).

*Fourth*, several families have and live in their family homes inside the said government center.

*Fifth*, almost all major transactions in the entirety of the BARMM are carried out in the BGC. Note that the BARMM covers five provinces, namely that of Maguindanao, Basilan, Lanao del Sur, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi, and the special geographical areas, namely the 63 barangays in North Cotabato that have chosen to include themselves in the BARMM. People come from far and wide, on a daily basis, to transact in the BGC. Thus, it is the busiest place in the city and the entire autonomous region.

*Sixth*, almost all important events in the BARMM are held in the BGC, like plenary sessions and culmination events. Thus, when there are events, people flock in the government center, which causes even more congestion.

As a result of these factors, the Bangsamoro Government Center has become very overcrowded. Offices are filled with people every day. Moreover, even when people arrive early at the BGC entrance gate, entry to the government center is riddled with traffic resulting to tardiness of employees and those with appointments in the government center. Its streets are often filled with cars with not enough parking space, thus clogging certain entry and exit points.

It is completely normal for a government center to be busy, but it is another issue when the government center is overwhelmingly congested and lacking space. It affects the overall efficiency and productivity of the ministries, offices, and agencies.

Having said all of these, there is a need for an annex BGC to decongest and unclog the government center. The said annex BGC should also be in Cotabato City and proximate to the main BGC for ease of access to and from and for ease of transactions in the different entities of the Bangsamoro Government.

In view of the aforementioned, the passage of this legislative measure is earnestly sought.
