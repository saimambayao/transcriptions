In the case of a Re-Enacted Budget, the period for the award of contract shall be suspended from the beginning of the fiscal year and shall begin to run only after the effectivity of the enacted new GAAB.

**B. VIREMENT RULES**

**Section 45. Meaning of Savings.** — Savings may be declared when there are balances of any programmed appropriations in the GAAB that have not been released or obligated as a result of:

(a) Completion, discontinuance, or abandonment of a P/A/P by the Head of the M/O/A concerned for justifiable causes not attributable to the fault or negligence of the M/O/A and which will render it impossible to implement said P/A/P within the fiscal year;

(b) Non-commencement or the inability of a M/O/A to obligate an allotment for justifiable causes not attributable to the fault or negligence of the M/O/A and which will render it impossible to implement said P/A/P within the year;

(c) Improved systems and efficiencies in the implementation of P/A/Ps and delivery of services that are consistent with their performance targets;

(d) A lower contract cost than that provided in the approved budget for the contract; and

(e) Unused Personnel Services costs pertaining to (i) unfilled, vacant, or abolished positions; (ii) non-entitlement to allowances and benefits; (iii) leaves of absence without pay; and (iv) death of pensioners, decrease in the number of retirees, or other related causes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, final discontinuance or abandonment of a P/A/P, whether released or unreleased, allotment for which remain unobligated may be declared by the Chief Minister as savings in case of a declaration of a state of national or regional calamity as may be necessary to augment deficient P/A/Ps of M/O/As or SPFs that are necessary to immediately address the existing calamity.

In case final discontinuance or abandonment is used as basis in the declaration of savings, such discontinued or abandoned P/A/P shall no longer be proposed for funding in the next two (2) fiscal years, except in cases where savings were declared from final discontinuance or abandonment of a P/A/P in view of a declaration of a state of national or regional calamity as may be needed to augment deficient P/A/Ps of the M/O/A or SPFs that are necessary to immediately address the existing calamity.

**Section 46. Authority to Declare and Use Savings.** — The following are authorized to declare and use savings in their respective appropriations to augment actual deficiencies incurred for the current fiscal year in any item of their respective appropriations:

(a) the Chief Minister, as to the appropriation of the Executive Department;

(b) the Speaker of the Parliament, as to the appropriation of the Parliament; and

(c) the Presiding Justice of the Shari’ah High Court, as to the appropriation of the Shari’ah High Court.

The MFBM shall determine the procedure and the supporting documents needed in the declaration and use of savings authorized under this Act and national laws or rules and regulations.

**Section 47. Rules on Augmentation.** — Augmentation is the act of the officers who are authorized to use savings in their respective appropriations to cover a deficiency in any existing item of appropriation within their respective offices. A deficiency in an item of appropriations may result from unforeseen modifications or adjustments in the P/A/Ps or re-assessment in the use, prioritization, or distribution of resources.

The particulars of the expenditures to be funded from savings should be within the scope of or covered by an existing and previously funded P/A/P. The existence of a P/A/P, regardless of the availability of the allotment class, is sufficient for augmentation. In no case shall a non-existent P/A/P be funded by augmentation from savings or by using an appropriation authorized in the GAAB.

**Section 48. Rules on Modification in the Allotment.** — As a general rule, M/O/As shall spend what is programmed in their respective appropriations in this Act. In exceptional circumstances, M/O/As may modify the allotment issued within an activity or project subject to approval of the following ensued by the timely submission of reports:

(a) The Minister or Head of Office, for the following: (i) change in the details of an activity or project without changing its nature and within the same operating unit; and (ii) change in the object of expenditure (e.g. salaries and wages, travelling expenses, or investment outlays) within an allotment class (Personnel Services, MOOE, or Capital Outlays); and

(b) The MFBM, for the following modifications: (i) from one allotment class to another; (ii) from one operating unit to another; (iii) within an SPF; and (iv) for the payment of magna carta benefits authorized under existing law.

All modifications shall not entail any increase in the total amount appropriated for an activity or project.

The MFBM shall issue further guidelines as necessary to clarify the rules on modifications in allotments.

**Section 49. Suspension of Expenditure of Appropriations.** — Except as otherwise provided in the GAAB, the Chief Minister may, whenever in his or her judgment the public interest so requires, after due notice to the Minister or Head of Office concerned, suspend or otherwise stop further expenditure of funds allotted for any M/O/A or any other expenditure authorized in the GAAB or other appropriations law, except for Personnel Services appropriations used for permanent officials and employees.

In case the Minister of Finance, and Budget and Management shall find at any time that the probable receipt from local taxes, fees, and charges, or other sources of any fund will be less than anticipated and that as a consequence, the amount available for the remainder of the term of the appropriations or for any allotment period will be less than the amount estimated or allotted therefor, he or she shall have the authority, with the approval of the Chief Minister and after notice to the M/O/A concerned, to modify, amend, or reduce the amount or amounts previously allotted to conform to the targeted budgetary goals.

**Section 50. Adjustment of Appropriations for Reorganization.** — When a specific function or activity is transferred or assigned from one M/O/A to another under authority of law, the balances of appropriations that are available and necessary to finance or discharge such function or activity may, with the approval of the Chief Minister, be transferred to and be made available for use by the M/O/A to which said function or activity was transferred or assigned, to be spent for the purpose for which the funds were originally allocated. The transferred balances shall be credited to any applicable existing appropriation account/s or to new appropriation account/s that are hereby authorized to be established for the purpose, and shall be merged with any fund already in the applicable existing or newly established appropriations account/s and thereafter be accounted as one fund.

The funding requirements of reorganized M/O/As with approved reorganization plans, or reorganized pursuant to a law enacted after the approval of the GAAB, are deemed automatically appropriated and shall be available for expenditure, subject to the compliance of the requirements as stated in Sections 37, 38, and 39 of this Act.

The Minister of Finance, and Budget and Management is hereby authorized to make necessary adjustments in the appropriations to carry out the provisions of this section. The Minister or Head of Office concerned, with the approval of the Minister of Finance, and Budget and Management, is hereby authorized to make necessary salary adjustments resulting from final selection of personnel to fill the positions in the staffing patterns of reorganized M/O/As, to make necessary salary adjustments resulting from new appointments, promotions or salary increases, subject to the provisions of Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 17 or the “Bangsamoro Civil Service Code.”

**Section 54.

Revolving Fund.** — Receipts derived from business-type activities of M/O/As may be constituted by an act of Parliament into a Revolving Fund, which shall be separately recorded and deposited in an authorized government depository bank. Subject to conditions the Parliament may prescribe, the Revolving Fund may be used to cover the operating expenses for the business-type activities of the M/O/A concerned. The Revolving fund shall be considered self-perpetuating and self-liquidating, and all obligations or expenditures incurred by said business-type activities shall be charged against the Revolving Fund. The M/O/As concerned shall submit to the MFBM the report of income realized from and expenditures incurred and charged against the Revolving Fund.
