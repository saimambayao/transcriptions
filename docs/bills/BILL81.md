**AN ACT**
**PROVIDING FOR A MICROFINANCING PROGRAM FOR MICRO AND SMALL-SCALE ENTERPRISES WITHIN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO, PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

In 2018, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region contributed 0.6 percent to the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP), growing at 7.2 percent, the highest among all regions. The improved economic performance was mainly due to the recovery of the agriculture, forestry, and fishery sector which grew at 5.8 percent in the same year.

However, despite its vast water sources, fertile lands, and suitable climatic conditions ideal for various farming activities, the region has been continuously saddled by the slow pace of economic performance.

One of the problems besetting the region is the lack of financial intermediaries to provide financing services to farmers, fisherfolks, and small-scale enterprises, which includes having low access to and availability of financial services to the Bangsamoro people, including investment financing. Furthermore, financial literacy, limited knowledge on accessing formal or bank financing, numerous documentary requirements, and limited collateral are some of the challenges experienced by potential borrowers.

The region has the lowest density of banks in the country. Excluding Cotabato City and the 63 barangays erstwhile part of North Cotabato, there are only 19 banks in the BARMM as of 2018. According to the Central Bank, this accounts for 0.2 percent of the total number of banks in the country. This means that on average, there is only 0.05 bank for every 100,000 residents in the region, as compared to 6.6 and 12 banks in Mindanao and the national level, respectively.

Hence, farmers and entrepreneurs are dependent on local financing groups, mostly traders or lending institutions that offer interest-bearing loans. The minimal harvest of farmers is already committed to local traders, while the meager profit of small entrepreneurs mostly goes to lending institutions. This farmer-trader relation and dependency of entrepreneurs to lending institutions result in lower-income and revenue for farmers and small entrepreneurs and limit their capability to achieve financial freedom.

Moreover, the financing climate of the BARMM is facing two challenges that may result in non-observance of Islamic financing practices and ineffective financial management. The only available financial support to small and medium Bangsamoro entrepreneurs are banks and private lending institutions which offer interest-bearing loans.

Through this measure, the promotion and the development of Islamic financing for micro and small-scale enterprises will further help the Bangsamoro government’s efforts to encourage and support the building of entrepreneurial capability in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. With the end view of creating opportunities for greater financial inclusion, especially for the undeserved Bangsamoro population, the enactment of this bill will help create an environment conducive to the development and growth of vibrant regional enterprises and shall act as a catalyst for intensified private sector activity to accelerate and sustain regional economic growth.

In so doing, the government can efficiently expand the funding base for micro and small-sized enterprises through financial arrangements with risk-sharing as the core element, and in contributing to financial stability through the use of financial contracts and services that are founded on risk-sharing rather than speculation, in compliance with Shari’ah principles.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
