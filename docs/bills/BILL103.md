**ESTABLISHING A LEVEL I GENERAL HOSPITAL IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF TABUAN-LASA, PROVINCE OF BASILAN, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

It is the policy of the State to protect and promote the right to health of the people and to instill health consciousness among them.

Moreover, the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao mandates the Bangsamoro Government to adopt a policy on health that provides for a comprehensive and integrated health service delivery to its constituents.

It further directs the autonomous government to establish, by law, a general hospital system to serve the health requirements of its people and ensure that the individual basic right to life shall be attainable through the prompt intervention of excellent and affordable medical services.

In the BARMM, access to basic health facilities and services has been one of the primary and recurring challenges faced by its inhabitants due to inadequate, uneven distribution, and practically non-existing health facilities, especially in remote areas. This is especially true in the Province of Basilan where there are only six (6) hospitals – four (4) in Isabela City and two (2) in Lamitan City.

However, for the remaining Basilan municipalities, there are only a number of established barangay health centers which attempt to provide basic health services to their constituents. This includes the health centers in the Municipality of Tabuan-Lasa.

The Municipality of Tabuan-Lasa in the Province of Basilan is a coastal area outside the island of Basilan created through Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act No. 187, and ratified on March 29, 2008. Based on the 2020 Population Census, the municipality has a total population of 29,327.

Since its creation, the Municipality of Tabuan-Lasa has only a few barangay health centers which provide basic health services to its constituents. Hence, critical health cases require the transport of patients to the nearest hospital by boat. This often results in the loss of lives because of delays in diagnosis and treatment of urgent care patients.

Under these dire conditions, the concomitant rights of the Bangsamoro people vis-a-vis the duties and responsibilities of the Bangsamoro Government are very clear and must be upheld by the regional government.

Hence, to give substance and spirit to the provisions of the Philippine Constitution and the Bangsamoro Organic Law, there is an urgent need for the construction and establishment of the Tabuan-Lasa General Hospital, a measure that upholds Tabuan-Lasa constituents’ societal rights, and their individual basic rights to life and health care services.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
