**Section 194. Duty to Bargain Collectively when there Exists a Collective Bargaining Agreement.** When there is a collective bargaining agreement, the duty to bargain collectively shall also mean that neither party shall terminate nor modify such agreement during its lifetime. However, either party can serve a written notice to terminate or modify the agreement at least sixty (60) days prior to its expiration date.

Any provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, workers shall have the right, subject to such rules and regulations as the Minister of Labor and Employment may promulgate, to participate in policy and decision-making processes of the establishment where they are employed insofar as said processes will directly affect their rights, benefits and welfare.

The labor union receiving the majority of the valid votes cast shall be certified as the exclusive bargaining agent of all the workers in the unit.

At the expiration of the freedom period, the employer shall continue to recognize the majority status of the incumbent bargaining agent where no petition for certification election is filed.

**CHAPTER VI**
**UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES**

**Section 207. Concept of Unfair Labor Practice and Procedure for Prosecution thereof.** Unfair labor practices violate the constitutional right of workers and employees to self-organization, are inimical to the legitimate interests of both labor and management, including their right to bargain collectively and otherwise deal with each other in an atmosphere of freedom and mutual respect, disrupt industrial peace and hinder the promotion of healthy and stable labor-management relations.

Consequently, unfair labor practices are not only violations of the civil rights of both labor and management but are also criminal offenses against the State which shall be subject to prosecution and punishment as herein provided.

The civil aspects of all cases involving unfair labor practices, which may include claims for actual, moral, exemplary and other forms of damages, attorney’s fees and other affirmative relief, shall be under the jurisdiction of the Bangsamoro Labor Arbiters. The Bangsamoro Labor Arbiters shall give utmost priority to the hearing and resolution of all cases involving unfair labor practices. They shall resolve such cases within thirty (30) calendar days from the time they are submitted for decision.

Recovery of civil liability in the administrative proceedings shall bar recovery under the Civil Code.

No criminal prosecution under this Book may be instituted without a final judgment finding that an unfair labor practice was committed, having been first obtained in the preceding paragraph. During the pendency of such administrative proceeding, the running of the period of prescription of the criminal offense herein penalized shall be considered interrupted: Provided, however, that the final judgment in the administrative proceedings shall not be binding in the criminal case nor be considered as evidence of guilt but merely as proof of compliance of the requirements therein set forth.

**Section 208. Unfair Labor Practices of Employers.** It shall be unlawful for an employer to commit any of the following unfair labor practice to:

a. Interfere with, restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of their right to self-organization;
b. Require as a condition of employment that a person or an employee shall not join a labor organization or shall withdraw from one to which he belongs;
c. Contract out services or functions being performed by union members when such will interfere with, restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of their rights to self-organization;
d. Initiate, dominate, assist or otherwise interfere with the formation or administration of any labor organization, including the giving of financial or other support to it or its organizers or supporters;
e. Discriminate in regard to beliefs, culture, tribal affiliations, wages, hours of work and other terms and conditions of employment in order to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization. Nothing in this Code or in any other law shall stop the parties from requiring membership in a recognized collective bargaining agent as a condition for employment, except those employees who are already members of another union at the time of the signing of the collective bargaining agreement. Employees of an appropriate bargaining unit who are not members of the recognized collective bargaining agent may be assessed a reasonable fee equivalent to the dues and other fees paid by members of the recognized collective bargaining agent, if such non-union members accept the benefits under the collective bargaining agreement: Provided, that the individual authorization required under Section 177 shall not apply to the non-members of the recognized collective bargaining agent;
f. Dismiss, discharge or otherwise prejudice or discriminate against an employee for having given or being about to give testimony under this Code;
g. Dismiss, discharge or otherwise prejudice or discriminate against an employee by reason of religion, political affiliation, age and sex;
h. Violate the duty to bargain collectively as prescribed by this Code;
i. Pay negotiation or attorney’s fees to the union or its officers or agents as part of the settlement of any issue in collective bargaining or any other dispute; or
j. Violate a collective bargaining agreement.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph notwithstanding, only the officers and agents of corporations, associations or partnerships who have actually participated in, authorized or ratified unfair labor practices shall be held criminally liable.

**Section 209. Unfair Labor Practices of Labor Organizations.** It shall be unfair labor practice for a labor organization, its officers, agents or representatives to:

a. Restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of their right to self-organization. However, a labor organization shall have the right to prescribe its own rules with respect to the acquisition or retention of membership;
b. Cause or attempt to cause an employer to discriminate against an employee, including discrimination against an employee with respect to whom membership in such organization has been denied or to terminate an employee on any ground other than the usual terms and conditions under which membership or continuation of membership is made available to other members;
c. Violate the duty, or refuse to bargain collectively with the employer, provided it is the representative of the employees;
d. Cause or attempt to cause an employer to pay or deliver or agree to pay or deliver any money or other things of value, in the nature of an exaction, for services which are not performed or not to be performed, including the demand for fee for union negotiations;
e. Ask for or accept negotiation or attorney’s fees from employers as part of the settlement of any issue in collective bargaining or any other dispute; or
f. Violate a collective bargaining agreement.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph notwithstanding, only the officers, members of governing boards, representatives or agents or members of labor associations or organizations who have actually participated in, authorized or ratified unfair labor practices shall be held criminally liable.

**CHAPTER VII**
**GRIEVANCE MACHINERY AND VOLUNTARY ARBITRATION**

**Section 210. Grievance Machinery and Voluntary Arbitration.** The parties to a collective bargaining agreement shall include therein provisions that will ensure the mutual observance of its terms and conditions. They shall establish a machinery for the adjustment and resolution of grievances arising from the interpretation or implementation of their collective bargaining agreement and those arising from the interpretation or enforcement of company personnel policies.

All grievances submitted to the grievance machinery which are not settled within seven (7) calendar days from the date of its submission shall automatically be referred to voluntary arbitration prescribed in the collective bargaining agreement.

For this purpose, parties to a collective bargaining agreement shall name and designate in advance a Voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators, or include in the agreement a procedure for the selection of such Voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators, preferably from the listing of qualified Voluntary Arbitrators duly accredited by the BCMB. In case the parties fail to select a Voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators, the Board shall designate the Voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators, as may be necessary, pursuant to the selection procedure agreed upon in the collective bargaining agreement, which shall act with the same force and effect as if the Arbitrator or panel of Arbitrators have been selected by the parties as described above.

**CHAPTER VIII**
**STRIKES AND LOCK-OUTS**

**Section 211. Strikes, Picketing, and Lockouts.**

a. It is the policy of the Bangsamoro Government to encourage free trade unionism and free collective bargaining.
b. Workers shall have the right to engage in concerted activities for purposes of collective bargaining or for their mutual benefit and protection. The right of legitimate labor organizations to strike and picket and of employers to lockout shall continue to be recognized and respected. However, no labor union may strike and no employer may declare a lockout on grounds involving inter-union and intra union disputes.
c. In case of bargaining deadlocks, the duly certified or recognized bargaining agent may file a notice of strike or the employer may file a notice of lockout with the Bangsamoro Conciliation and Mediation Board (BCMB) at least 30 days before the intended date thereof. In cases of unfair labor practice, the period of notice shall be 15 days and in the absence of a duly certified or recognized bargaining agent, the notice of strike may be filed by any legitimate labor organization in behalf of its members. However, in case of dismissal from employment of union officers duly elected in accordance with the union constitution and by-laws, which may constitute union busting, where the existence of the union is threatened, the 15-day cooling-off period shall not apply and the union may take action immediately.
d. The notice must be in accordance with such implementing rules and regulations as the BCMB may promulgate.
e. During the cooling-off period, it shall be the duty of the BCMB to exert all efforts at mediation and conciliation to effect a voluntary settlement. Should the dispute remain unsettled until the lapse of the requisite number of days from the mandatory filing of the notice, the labor union may strike or the employer may declare a lockout.
f. A decision to declare a strike must be approved by a simple majority of the total union membership in the bargaining unit concerned, obtained by secret ballot in meetings or referenda called for that purpose. A decision to declare a lockout must be approved by a simple majority of the board of directors of the corporation or association or of the partners in a partnership, obtained by secret ballot in a meeting called for that purpose. The decision shall be valid for the duration of the dispute based on substantially the same grounds considered when the strike or lockout vote was taken. The Ministry may, at its own initiative or upon the request of any affected party, supervise the conduct of the secret balloting. In every case, the union or the employer shall furnish the Ministry the results of the voting at least seven days before the intended strike or lockout, subject to the cooling-off period herein provided.
g. When, in his or her opinion, there exists a labor dispute causing or likely to cause a strike or lockout in an industry that provides essential services to the Bangsamoro region, the Minister of Labor and Employment may assume jurisdiction over the dispute and decide it or certify the same to the BLAC for compulsory arbitration or to a Voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators. Such assumption or certification shall have the effect of automatically enjoining the intended or impending strike or lockout as specified in the assumption or certification order. If one has already taken place at the time of assumption or certification, all striking or locked out employees shall immediately return-to-work and the employer shall immediately resume operations and readmit all workers under the same terms and conditions prevailing before the strike or lockout. Essential services refer to functions or services rendered by an establishment, which if interrupted, would endanger the life, personal safety or health of whole or part of the population. for this purpose, the Minister of Labor and Employment, by appropriate regulations, shall determine the industries engaged in essential services after consultations with the BTIPC.

In labor disputes affecting industries engaged in essential services, it shall be the duty of the union and employer to provide and maintain the operation or delivery of services. In case of hospitals, clinics or medical institutions, the union and employer shall provide and maintain an effective and functional workforce, whose movement and services shall be unhampered and unrestricted, as are necessary to ensure the proper and adequate protection of the life, personal safety and health of their patients, most especially emergency cases, for the duration of the labor dispute.

Within five (5) days from the issuance of the assumption or certification order, a preliminary conference or hearing shall immediately be conducted by the Office of Minister of Labor and Employment, the National Labor Relations Commission, or the Voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators as the case may be.

The foregoing notwithstanding, the Chief Minister shall not be precluded from, in consultation with the BTIPC, issuing a list of industries that, in his or her opinion, are essential to the regional interest, and from intervening at any time and assuming jurisdiction over any such labor dispute in order to settle or terminate the same.

h. Before or at any stage of the compulsory arbitration process, the parties may opt to submit their dispute to voluntary arbitration.
i. The Minister of Labor and Employment, the BLAC or the Voluntary Arbitrator shall decide or resolve the dispute, as the case may be. The decision of the Chief Minister, the Minister of Labor and Employment, the BLAC or the Voluntary Arbitrator shall be final and executory ten (10) calendar days after receipt thereof by the parties.

a. No labor organization or employer shall declare a strike or lockout without first having bargained collectively or without first having filed the notice required in the preceding Section or without the necessary strike or lockout vote first having been obtained and reported to the Ministry.

No strike or lockout shall be declared after assumption of jurisdiction by the Chief Minister or the Minister or after certification or submission of the dispute to compulsory or voluntary arbitration or during the pendency of cases involving the same grounds for the strike or lockout.

b. Any worker whose employment has been terminated as a consequence of an illegal lockout shall be entitled to reinstatement with full backwages.

Mere participation of a workers or union officer in a strike declared illegal for failure of the union to comply with the procedural requirements under paragraph (a) of this Section, shall not be a ground for termination of his or her employment, even if a replacement had been hired by the employer during such illegal strike.

c. No person shall obstruct, impede, or interfere with, by force, violence, coercion, threats or intimidation, any concerted action including picketing by employees during any labor controversy or in the exercise of the right to self-organization or collective bargaining, or shall aid or abet such obstruction or interference.

Any worker or union officer who, after due determination, knowingly and voluntarily participates in the commission of unlawful acts during strike may be declared to have lost his or her employment after due process.

d. No employer shall use or employ any strike-breaker, nor shall any person be employed as a strike-breaker.
e. No person engaged in picketing shall commit any act of violence, coercion or intimidation or obstruct the free ingress to or egress from the employer’s premises for lawful purposes, or obstruct public thoroughfares.

The police force shall keep out of the picket lines unless actual violence or other criminal acts occur therein.

However, the Minister of Labor and Employment or the BLAC may seek the assistance of law enforcement agencies to maintain peace and order, protect life and property, and/or enforce the law and legal order.

**Section 213. Improved Offer Balloting.** In an effort to settle a strike, the Ministry of Labor and Employment shall conduct a referendum by secret ballot on the improved offer of the employer on or before the 30th day of the strike. When at least a majority of the union members vote to accept the improved offer, the striking workers shall immediately return to work and the employer shall thereupon readmit them upon the signing of the agreement.

In case of a lockout, the Ministry of Labor and Employment shall also conduct a referendum by secret balloting on the reduced offer of the union on or before the 30th day of the lockout. When at least a majority of the board of directors or trustees or the partners holding the controlling interest in the case of a partnership vote to accept the reduced offer, the workers shall immediately return to work and the employer shall thereupon readmit them upon the signing of the agreement.

The employer shall have the burden of proving that the termination is with cause and due process.

**CHAPTER I**
**STATUS OF EMPLOYMENT**

**Section 217. Status of Employment.** All employees including project and seasonal employees, except those under probationary employment, are deemed regular.

Project and seasonal employees are regular for the duration of the project or season, as the case may be. For this purpose, project employment is employment in an existing project or undertaking the completion or termination of which has been determined and made known to the employee at the time of the engagement while seasonal is an employment based on the existence of a season in agricultural work or established periods of increased work demand and/or inherent industry fluctuations. In project and seasonal employment, workers are called to work from time to time and temporarily laid-off during the completion of the project or off-season but are in the work pool on leave with or without pay status in between projects or seasons.

All other forms of employment not contemplated under the foregoing paragraphs are prohibited and workers under such arrangements are deemed regular employees reckoned from the first day of employment.

For the avoidance of doubt, an employer-employee relationship exists when the worker is engaged to render work or service under the control of the employer, not only as to the end to be achieved, but also the manner, means and methods in reaching the end.

**Section 218. Probationary Employment.** Probationary employment shall not exceed six (6) months from the first day of service regardless of the nature of work to be performed. The job description and qualification standards to qualify for regular employment shall be made known by the employer to the employee at the time of the latter engagement. The services of probationary employee may be terminated for just or authorized causes or when he/she he fails to qualify as a regular employee.

**Section 219. Prohibition on Labor-Only Contracting.** Labor-only contracting violates workers’ right to security of tenure and is prohibited. There is labor-only contracting when the contractor merely recruits, supplies or places workers to a principal regardless of substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries, work premises, and a license, among others.

In all cases where labor-only contracting is present, the workers shall be deemed regular employees of the principal, retroactive to the date they were first deployed to the principal, without prejudice to the filing of criminal, civil or administrative case against the labor-only contractor and the principal.

Compliance order affirmed by the Ministry of Labor and Employment shall be immediately executory unless restrained by an appropriate court.

In case the compliance order involves a directive to regularize workers, the employment of the latter shall not be terminated pending appeal of such order except for just and authorized cause. Any termination of workers pending appeal shall render the compliance order involving the regularization of workers immediately executory.

Additionally, the Ministry of Labor and Employment shall impose a fine of Five million pesos (Php 5,000,000.00) against any labor-only contractor. The Ministry of Labor and Employment shall also have the power to preventively or permanently close the operations of any labor-only contractor.

**Section 220. Mandatory Licensing of Contractors.** It shall be mandatory for all persons or entities engaged in contracting to obtain a license from the Ministry of Labor and Employment. The license shall be issued to qualified contractors upon compliance with the following requirements:

a. Have an independent business, separate and distinct from the principal;
b. Paid-up capital or net worth of at least Five Million Pesos (Php5,000,000.00) which may be increased as deemed appropriate through tripartite consultation;
c. An expert or specialist on the job, work or service being contracted that shall not be directly related to the principal business of the principal. For this purpose, expertise or specialization shall be established by showing, among others, a core of competent professionals or skilled workers especially trained to carry out the job, work or service or track record in such field of specialization;
d. An employer with regular employees and have equipment, machineries or tools necessary to perform or complete the job, work or service contracted out;
e. Exercise control over the performance and completion of the job, work or service contracted out;
f. Certification of compliance with labor and social welfare laws including proof of payment of social security, PhilHealth Insurance Corporation, and Home Development Mutual Fund (PagIBIG) contributions; and
g. Payment of license fee, which shall not be lower than One Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php100,000.00)

The license shall be valid for a period of three (3) years and may be renewed upon compliance with the requirements prescribed by the Ministry of Labor and Employment. In all cases, the contractor shall demonstrate that it has financial capacity to carry on its business based on factors such as, but not limited, to the number of its employees and the nature of its business.

Any legitimate labor organization shall have access to copies of licenses issued to contractors and all submissions made in connection with such license.

For this purpose, the Ministry of Labor and Employment in consultation with the Bangsamoro Tripartite Council, shall issue the appropriate regulations for the licensing, renewal, suspension, and revocation of licenses of contractors, including the accountabilities of the licensing officer in case the license issued is in violation of, or in simulation of any of the requirement for licensing as enumerated above, or upon finding labor-only contracting committed by a duly-licensed contractor.

In no case shall the private recruitment and placement agencies or private employment agencies under Section 9 be allowed to engage in contracting.

**Section 221. Rights of Employees under Service Contracting.** The terms and conditions of employment of the employees under service contracting shall not be lower than the minimum standards set by law and regulations.

**Section 222. Posting of Bond.** The principal may require the contractor or subcontractor to furnish a bond equal to the cost of labor under contract, on condition that the bond will answer for the wages due the employees should the contractor or subcontractor, as the case may be, fail to pay the same.

**Section 223. Solidary Liability.** The provisions of existing laws to the contrary notwithstanding, every principal shall be held solidarily liable with the service contractor for any violation of any provision of this Code. For purposes of determining the extent of their civil liability under this Chapter, they shall be considered as direct employers.

(a) That prohibited or unlawful acts have been threatened and will be committed and will be continued unless restrained, but no injunction or temporary restraining order shall be issued on account of any threat, prohibited or unlawful act, except against the person or persons, association or organization making the threat or committing the prohibited or unlawful act or actually authorizing or ratifying the same after actual knowledge thereof;
(b) That substantial and irreparable injury to complainant’s property will follow;

(d) That complainant has no adequate remedy at law; and
(e) That the public officers charged with the duty to protect complainant’s property are unable or unwilling to furnish adequate protection.

Such hearing shall be held after due and personal notice has been served, in such manner as the Board shall direct, to all known persons against whom relief is sought, and also to the Local Chief Executive and other public officials of the province or city within which the unlawful acts have been threatened or committed, charged with the duty to protect complainant’s property: Provided, however, that if a complainant shall also allege that, unless a temporary restraining order shall be issued without notice, a substantial and irreparable injury to complainant’s property will be unavoidable, such a temporary restraining order may be issued upon testimony under oath, sufficient, if sustained, to justify the Board in issuing a temporary injunction upon hearing after notice. Such a temporary restraining order shall be effective for no longer than twenty (20) days and shall become void at the expiration of said twenty (20) days. No such temporary restraining order or temporary injunction shall be issued except on condition that complainant shall first file an undertaking with adequate security in an amount to be fixed by the Board sufficient to recompense those enjoined for any loss, expense or damage caused by the improvident or erroneous issuance of such order or injunction, including all reasonable costs, together with a reasonable attorney’s fee, and expense of defense against the order or against the granting of any injunctive relief sought in the same proceeding and subsequently denied by the Board.

The undertaking herein mentioned shall be understood to constitute an agreement entered into by the complainant and the surety upon which an order may be rendered in the same suit or proceeding against said complainant and surety, upon a hearing to assess damages, of which hearing, complainant and surety shall have reasonable notice, the said complainant and surety submitting themselves to the jurisdiction of the Board for that purpose. But nothing herein contained shall deprive any party having a claim or cause of action under or upon such undertaking from electing to pursue his ordinary remedy by suit at law or in equity: Provided, further, That the reception of evidence for the application of a writ of injunction may be delegated by the Board to any of Members who shall conduct such hearings in such places as he/she may determine to be accessible to the parties and their witnesses and shall submit thereafter his recommendation to the Board.

**Sec. 250. Technical rules not binding and prior resort to amicable settlement.** In any proceeding before the BLCAB, the rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling. It is the spirit and intention of the Bangsamoro Labor and Employment Code (BLEC) that shall be given effect. It shall use every and all reasonable means to ascertain the facts in each case speedily and objectively and without regard to technicalities of law or procedure, all in the interest of due process. In any proceeding before the Board acting in quasi-judicial capacity or not, the parties may be represented by legal counsel but it shall be the duty of the Chairperson, any Member or any Conciliator-Mediator to exercise complete control of the proceedings at all stages.

Any provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, BLCAB officers shall exert all efforts towards the amicable settlement of a labor dispute within his or her jurisdiction.

Being a voluntary mode of settling labor-management disputes, the decision of the Voluntary Arbitrator and/or Panel of Voluntary Arbitrators is binding on the parties and final and executory.

For this purpose, a Bangsamoro Voluntary Arbitration Tripartite Council (BVATC) shall be established by the Minister to administer the Bangsamoro Voluntary Arbitration Program. It shall be under the direct supervision and control of the Minister as a subcommittee of the BTIPC with the BLRS as the Secretariat. It shall have as many members as necessary, which shall be chosen from among the sectoral nominees of the most representative workers’ and employers’ organizations in the region, who shall elect from among themselves the Chairperson of the Council.

The Chairperson and Members of the BVATC shall not be considered as government employees and shall not receive compensation or emoluments from the government, except per diem on Council meetings or activities and/or Voluntary Arbitration fees when acting as Voluntary Arbitrator/s to be sourced from the Special Voluntary Arbitration Fund.

**Sec. 253. Powers and Functions.** The BVATC shall advise the Board and the MOLE on promoting Voluntary Arbitration as the preferred mode of dispute settlement. The Council shall:

All grievances submitted to the grievance machinery that are not settled within seven (7) calendar days from submission shall automatically be referred to voluntary arbitration prescribed in the Collective Bargaining Agreement.

For this purpose, parties shall name and designate their Voluntary Arbitrator or Panel of Voluntary Arbitrators in their CBA. In the alternative, parties shall provide in the CBA a procedure for selecting such Voluntary Arbitrator or Panel of Voluntary Arbitrators, preferably from the listing of qualified and duly accredited Voluntary Arbitrators.

**Sec. 257. Procedures.** The Voluntary Arbitrator or Panel of Voluntary Arbitrators shall have the power to hold hearings, receive evidences and take whatever action is necessary to resolve the issue or issues subject of the dispute, including efforts to effect a voluntary settlement between parties.

The attendance of any third party or the exclusion of any witness from the proceedings shall be determined by the Voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators. Hearing may be adjourned for cause or upon agreement by the parties. Unless the parties agree otherwise, it shall be mandatory for the Voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators to render an award or decision within twenty (20) calendar days from the date of submission of the dispute to voluntary arbitration.

**Sec. 258.
