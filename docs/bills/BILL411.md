**AN ACT**
**PROVIDING FOR THE CREATION OF PARLIAMENTARY DISTRICTS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM).**

**Explanatory Note**

Section 15, Article X of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides for the creation of autonomous regions in Muslim Mindanao composed of provinces, cities, municipalities, and geographical areas sharing common and distinctive historical and cultural heritage, economic and social structures, and other relevant characteristics, within the framework of the Constitution and the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of the Philippines.

Further, Congress enacted Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), establishing the autonomous political entity now known as the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). The BOL was signed into law on July 27, 2018 by former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, repealing R.A. No. 6734 as amended by R.A. No. 9054.

Section 2(a), Article III of the BOL provides that the territorial jurisdiction of the BARMM, subject to a mandatory plebiscite, shall be composed, among others, of the then Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) created under R.A. No. 6734, as amended by R.A. No. 9054, which includes the Province of Sulu.

A two-part plebiscite was held on January 21, 2019 for the ARMM territories, where all provinces voted to join the new autonomous region, and on February 5-6, 2019 for the City of Cotabato and the 16 barangays of North Cotabato seeking inclusion in the BARMM. Cotabato City and the 63 barangays of Cotabato province voted favorably to join the BARMM.

However, on September 9, 2024, the Supreme Court promulgated its En Banc Decision in *Province of Sulu, et al. v. Medialdea, et al.*, G.R. Nos. 242255, 243276, and 243693. While upholding the validity of the BOL, the Court declared the Province of Sulu not part of the BARMM.

Subsequently, the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act (BAA) No. 58, or the Bangsamoro Parliamentary District Act of 2024, was enacted on February 28, 2024, establishing 32 single-member parliamentary districts in the BARMM, including seven (7) for the Province of Sulu. Pursuant to the Supreme Court decision, the BTA enacted BAA No. 77, or the Bangsamoro Redistricting Act of 2025, amending BAA No. 58 to exclude Sulu.

Section 7(b), Article VII of the BOL provides that the Parliament may undertake new redistricting by law to ensure a more equitable representation of constituencies in the Parliament. Section 10 of the same Article further states:

> **Section 10. Redistricting for Parliamentary Membership.** - *The Parliament shall have the power to reconstitute by law the parliamentary districts apportioned among the provinces, cities, municipalities, and geographical areas of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region to ensure equitable representation in Parliament. The redistricting, merging, or creation of parliamentary districts shall be based on the number of inhabitants and additional provinces, cities, municipalities, and geographical areas, which shall become part of the Bangsamoro territorial jurisdiction.*
>
> *For the purpose of redistricting, parliamentary districts shall be apportioned based on the population and geographical area: Provided, That each district shall comprise, as far as practicable, contiguous, compact, and adjacent territorial jurisdiction: Provided, further, That each district shall have a population of at least one hundred thousand (100,000).*

Republic Act No. 12123 reset the first regular BARMM elections to October 13, 2025. However, in its En Banc Decision in G.R. Nos. E-02219 and E-02235 promulgated on September 30, 2025, the Supreme Court declared BAA 77 unconstitutional for the following reasons:

1. It altered and/or created new precincts during the election period in violation of the Voter's Registration Act;
2. It violated the BOL requirement that each district shall comprise, as far as practicable, contiguous, compact, and adjacent areas;
3. It improperly vested powers in Congress that the BOL assigns to the Bangsamoro Parliament, while constraining the Parliament by imposing a fixed minimum of seven seats;
4. It unlawfully expanded the President's appointment powers beyond what the BOL permits; and
5. Section 5 of BAA 77 severed the constitutional link between residence, voter registration, and representation.

The Court likewise declared BAA 58 unconstitutional and incapable of serving as the framework for the first parliamentary elections, noting that the exclusion of Sulu created a structural flaw resulting in disenfranchisement and disproportional representation inconsistent with the BOL mandate of fixed and proportionate representation.

As a consequence, the October 13, 2025 Parliamentary Elections cannot proceed absent a valid districting law. The Supreme Court ordered the BTA to determine the parliamentary districts by **October 30, 2025**, in strict compliance with the BOL and the criteria set by the Court, and directed the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) to hold the elections not later than **March 31, 2026**.

This decision underscores the urgent necessity of enacting a new districting law. As the interim government of the BARMM, the BTA has the mandate to enact a law determining parliamentary districts and to ensure fair and equitable representation of all Bangsamoro communities in the Parliament.

This measure seeks to create parliamentary districts in the BARMM in full and faithful compliance with the Constitution, the Bangsamoro Organic Law, and the directives of the Supreme Court. It ensures that all constituencies are represented fairly, thereby safeguarding the democratic rights of the Bangsamoro people and enabling the conduct of the first regular parliamentary elections in accordance with law.

The Province of Basilan has a recorded population of 541,947 as of 2024, which, under an ideal demographic distribution, would qualify it for five (5) parliamentary district seats, consistent with the population benchmark of approximately 100,000 inhabitants per district. However, owing to its unique island geography—wherein one municipality is physically separated from the main landmass by several nautical miles—strict compliance with the criteria of contiguity and population distribution proves impracticable. In this regard, it must be emphasized that the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) expressly provides that the apportionment standards shall apply "**as far as practicable**," recognizing the diversity of territorial and demographic conditions in the region.

Similarly, in the case of Maguindanao del Norte, the creation of the proposed Fifth District with a population of 81,945 constitutes a justified exception to the general population requirement of 100,000 inhabitants. This exception is warranted in consideration of the principles of **contiguity, compactness, and adjacency**, as well as the distinct cultural and historical identity of the communities comprising the proposed district.

In view of the foregoing, the immediate passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
