**AN ACT STRENGTHENING IRRIGATION SYSTEMS IN THE BANGSAMORO REGION AND PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Under the Republic Act (R.A.) No. 10969 or the “Free Irrigation Act”, all farmers with landholdings of eight (8) hectares and below are hereby exempted from paying irrigation service fees (ISF) for water derived from national irrigation systems (NIS) and communal irrigation systems (CIS) that were, or are to be, funded, constructed, maintained and administered by the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) and other government agencies, including those that have been turned over to irrigators associations (IAs). All unpaid ISF and the corresponding penalties of farmers with eight (8) hectares and below to NIA, and all loans, past due accounts, and the corresponding interests and penalties of IAs to NIA, are hereby condoned and written off from the books of NIA.

Through government-owned or -controlled corporations (GOCCs), particularly the NIA under R.A. 10969, vital support services, particularly irrigation service, through the con tinued construction, repair, and maintenance of necessary irrigation facilities, are aimed to be ensured, to increase the production of agricultural crops, encourage productivity, and increase the incomes of farmers.

The NIA, a chartered government-owned and controlled corporation created under R.A. No. 3601 on 22 June 1963, the precedent of R.A. 10969, is primarily responsible for irrigation development and management.

Section 2, Article V of the Organic Law provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise its authority over matters including agriculture, food security, inland waters, public works, infrastructure water supply and services, flood control, and irrigation systems, among others.

Section 30, Article XIII of the Organic Law states that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise its authority over water supply and services, flood control, and irrigation services. It is known to all that the Bangsamoro have a great reliance on the industry of agriculture, and it is to this end that we must exert all efforts to remove all obstacles to produce a greater yield in agriculture. Our lack of irrigation service is one such obstacle that must be eliminated with great urgency.

In close collaboration with the NIA that takes the lead in the development of irrigation projects and facilities in the country under R.A. 3601, the Bangsamoro Government shall fully harness its irrigation potential to increase the production and productivity of the region’s agricultural resources.

The country possesses about a 10.3 million hectares of agricultural land, out of which only 9.3% are considered to be irrigable. While the country is blessed with having one of the highest rainfall in the world at 2.200 millimeters per year, only 6% of the figure is being harvested. In comparison, India which harvests and collects 60% of their rainfall despite not having much. This is due to the lack of proper investment in irrigation system.

Irrigation remains to be a key factor in agriculture and rice production. The farmers are relying only during the rainy season and their produce is limited to only a period of almost six months in one year. Irrigated areas are the only areas where produce can be made consistently in a year, doubling rice production and in turn increasing productivity. Irrigation can be seen as an immediate solution for poverty alleviation in poverty-stricken areas, which are either often flooded for a whole year or farmers were unable to harvest due to a drought.

The current state of irrigation development in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is indicated by these statistics. In 2018, the potentially irrigable areas in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) were about 160, 150 hectares, while the area served was only about 50, 096 hectares or the equivalent of a development rate of 31.28 percent of the region’s irrigable areas.

This implies that the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region still has vast irrigation potentials that, if properly developed, will address food security and rice sufficiency in the region.

Presently, the National Irrigation Administration does not have a regional office in BARMM and also the Bangsamoro Government does have its separate body or office for irrigation. The autonomous region is presently served by NIA’s provincial offices in the provinces. Maguindanao is served by NIA Region XII, through its provincial office in Maguindanao. Lanao del Sur is served by NIA Region X, while the Island provinces of Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, and Basilan are served by the NIA Regional Office IX.

With the establishment of a clear structure for the irrigation concerns both for nationally and BARMM-funded programs and projects, the Bangsamoro Government would be able to address the irrigation gaps and it would be able to work directly on irrigation system development in the autonomous region.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
