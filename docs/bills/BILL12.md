**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

As the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao is still transitioning to genuine autonomy, this is an opportune time to reevaluate and recalibrate the region’s fisheries and aquatic resources sector to maximize its potential.

Within the BARMM, fisheries play a central role in coastal communities, which typically have limited opportunities for alternative forms of income. In 2013, the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) found that 16.8% of employed workers were associated with the fisheries subsector, a dependency higher than in any other Mindanao region.¹

In fact, according to the Fisheries Situation Report² released by the Philippines Statistics Authority, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is recorded to have produced 28.6% of the total fisheries production in the country. From April to June 2022, BARMM produced 346,420 metric tons of fish, which makes it the top-producing region in the country. Zamboanga Peninsula placed second while SOCCSKSARGEN placed third with their 12.6% and 7.4% shares, respectively in fish production.

Under the Bangsamoro Organic Law, the Bangsamoro people, indigenous peoples, and resident marginal fisherfolk enjoy preferential rights in the Bangsamoro regional waters. In other words, BARMM has been granted exclusive rights over living resources within 19 kilometers from the low-water mark of the coasts that are part of the Bangsamoro territorial jurisdiction.

Production inefficiencies, however, prevent optimization of the fisheries sector. Placing a premium on the existing fisheries and aquatic resources sector by focusing on the entirety of the production chain can make the best use of a high-value industry. In addition, expanding the scope of related marine-resourcing industries such as mariculture could provide sustainable alternatives to the fisheries sector.

The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources under the Department of Agriculture was reconstituted as a line bureau by virtue of Republic Act No. 8550 (Philippine Fisheries Code of 1998). In 1991, all powers and functions of the Department of Agriculture were transferred to the Autonomous Regional Government in Muslim Mindanao by virtue of Executive Order No. 460 issued by then President Corazon C. Aquino. Pursuant to said devolution of powers, the Department of Agriculture was established in the ARMM and performed the powers and functions enumerated in EO No. 460 including those enumerated in Executive Order No. 116, series of 1987. Said powers and functions included among others the exercise of supervision and control over all functions and activities pertaining to fisheries and aquatic resources.

With the passage of R.A. No. 11054 or the Organic Law for the BARMM and Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 13 or the Bangsamoro Administrative Code, the administration of fisheries and aquatic resources was placed under a single ministry along with agrarian reform and agriculture i.e. the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Agrarian Reform (MAFAR).

While the BTA has taken important steps toward setting up the legal infrastructure, the present parliament can build a stronger foundation for further development in areas like the fisheries and aquatic resources sector. Given the tremendous potential of fisheries and aquatic resources and the priority and resources made available to Ministries, there is a need to create the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources.

Hence, this bill seeks to reorganize MAFAR by creating a separate Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (MFAR) to address the distinct needs of the fisheries sector in the Bangsamoro Region. Under this proposed measure, the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources shall be the agency responsible for the development, improvement, management, and conservation of the country’s fisheries and aquatic resources.

A focus on the fisheries and aquatic resources sector, including the development of the fisheries infrastructure in BARMM such as processing facilities, cold storage, and new markets can optimize existing production limitations. This will likewise strengthen the institutional capacities of MFAR as the primary policy and regulatory body on fisheries and aquatic resources.

As with any administrative agency, the creation of the MFAR can provide institutional support to maximize the potential of the region’s economy by increasing its budgetary allocations. This Act could have a significant impact on the fisheries and aquatic resources sector, as well as potentially improve maritime security across the region.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
