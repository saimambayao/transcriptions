**AN ACT**
**ESTABLISHING THE BANGSAMORO ENDOWMENT FUND FOR CULTURE AND THE ARTS**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

There are thirteen (13) Islamized ethnolinguistic groups in the country, majority of which reside in the Bangsamoro Region. These different ethnolinguistic groups offer unique cultures and practices that may be a source of inspiration to Bangsamoro artists and writers. There are exceptionally talented Moro artists whom the Bangsamoro Government can assist in developing their crafts, in showcasing their talents, and ultimately, in placing the Bangsamoro Culture and Arts on the national and international scene. Through the Bangsamoro Endowment Fund for the Culture and the Arts, these artists will be given such opportunities through the establishment of programs and grants of financial assistance for their benefit.

In view of the foregoing, the immediate passage of this bill is earnestly requested.
