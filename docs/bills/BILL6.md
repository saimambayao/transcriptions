**CONSTITUTING THE PARLIAMENTARY DISTRICTS OF THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION, ENSURING EQUITABLE REPRESENTATION IN THE PARLIAMENT, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Philippine Congress passed into law the RA 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law which provided for the establishment of the autonomous political entity known as the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.

Signed into law by President Rodrigo Roa Duterte on July 26, 2018, the purpose of this Organic Law is to establish a political entity, provide for its basic structure of government in recognition of the justness and legitimacy of the cause of the Bangsamoro people and the aspirations of Muslim Filipinos and all indigenous cultural communities in the BARMM to secure their identity and posterity, allowing for meaningful self-governance within the framework of the Constitution and the national sovereignty as well as territorial integrity of the Republic of the Philippines.

A two-part plebiscite was held on January 21, 2019 for ARMM areas where the whole region opted to join the new autonomous region, and on February 5-6, 2019 for Cotabato and the 16 municipalities of Lanao del Norte, including barangays which petitioned to join the Bangsamoro. Cotabato City and the 63 barangays from the Cotabato province voted favorably to join the new Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).

The new Bangsamoro Region is now composed of its constituent local government units: the six (6) provinces of North Maguindanao, South Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Basilan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi, the three (3) cities of Cotabato, Lamitan, and Marawi, 116 municipalities and 2,590 barangays (including 63 in the special geographic area in Cotabato province).

Under Section 4(b) Article XVI of RA 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law, one of the priorities of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority is the determination of Parliamentary districts for the first regular election for the members of the Parliament subject to the standard set in Section 10, Article VII of the Organic Law.

As provided in the Organic Law, the first regular election of the BARMM for the eighty (80) members of the Parliament is on May 9, 2022 or second Monday of every third year after May 1992, together with the national elections, hence the need to redistrict the Bangsamoro region in time for the purpose.

Section 7, Article VII of the same Law details the allocation of seats for the parliament. The 80-member Parliament allocates seats for Party Representatives, Parliament District Representatives, and the Sectoral Representatives, each provided with different modes of selection. The Party Representatives, comprising one-half of the membership, shall have seats based proportionately on the percentages of votes obtained by each political party, of which the details will be expressed in the Bangsamoro Electoral Code. The manner of election for the Sectoral Representatives, constituting 10% of the seats, will be determined by the Parliament. Section 7(b) of the same article further details that the Parliamentary District Seats shall not exceed more than 40% of the total membership, and shall be elected through direct plurality vote from single parliamentary districts apportioned for the areas and in the manner provided for by the Parliament. Hence, the necessity to create the Parliamentary Districts for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

Section 10, Article VII of RA 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law adds that *"Redistricting for Parliamentary Membership. - The Parliament shall have the power to reconstitute by law the parliamentary districts apportioned among the provinces, cities, municipalities, and geographical areas of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region to ensure equitable representation in the Parliament. The redistricting, merging, or creation of parliamentary districts shall be based on the number of inhabitants and additional provinces, cities, municipalities, and geographical areas, which shall become part of the Bangsamoro territorial jurisdiction."*

The redistricting, merging, or creation of parliamentary districts shall be based on the numbers of inhabitants and additional provinces, cities, municipalities, and geographic areas, which shall become part of the Bangsamoro territorial jurisdiction.

It is emphasized that for the purpose of redistricting, parliamentary districts shall be apportioned based on population and geographic area: Provided, that each district shall comprise, as far as practicable, contiguous, compact, and adjacent territorial jurisdiction: Provided, further, that each district shall have a population of at least one hundred thousand (100,000). Also, the underlying principle of equitable representation of the constituents in the Parliament must strictly be observed.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
