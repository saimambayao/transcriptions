**Explanatory Note**

The newly established Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is one of the regions in the country endowed with rich land and inland water resources. Specifically, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region’s inland water resources include lakes, marshes, large bodies of rivers and tributaries, particularly found in the mainland areas of Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur provinces.

Lake Lanao, the second largest lake in the country, is a proclaimed watershed reserve by virtue of Proclamation No. 871, issued on February 26, 1992. It is qualified as part of the initial components of the National Integrated Protected Area System (NIPAS) of the government under the NIPAS Act of 1992 or Republic Act No. 7586. Lake Lanao has five watersheds with rivers and major tributaries totaling over 431km. The waters from these rivers and tributaries drain into the lake and goes out through a singular outlet, namely the Agus River, which supplies hydroelectric power to the entirety of Mindanao.¹

The Dimapatoy Watershed measures approximately 37.65 square kilometers with an elevation of 157 meters (above sea level). Located in the Municipality of Datu Odin Sinsuat (7.1407 deg. N, 124.2018 deg E),² the watershed serves as one of the main sources of drinking water supply of Cotabato City.³ Simultaneously, the watershed partly supplies to the Municipalities of Datu Odin Sinsuat and Sultan Kudarat. In addition, Cotabato City alone has a residence of more than 300,000 individuals.⁴

The Dimapatoy Conservation Area is a location which receives protection because of its recognized natural, ecological, and economic values. The protected area shall be effectively managed as a critical tool for safeguarding biodiversity in the area, maintaining eco-system balance, preserving important habitats, building resilience to climate change, providing food supply, conserving natural resources, and foremost, maintaining adequate and quality water supply.

Last October 29-31, 2022, Severe Tropical Storm Paeng (internationally known as Nalgae) brought disastrous effects not only in the landslide and flood affected areas, but also the service areas of the Metro Cotabato Water District (MCWD), covering the Cotabato City and Maguindanao areas, as water supply was disrupted for three days due to mud that coalesced with the water source. This is attributed to the lack of trees that could hold the heavy rains around the area.⁵

Republic Act No. 11054, also known as the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, established that the Bangsamoro Government shall have the power, authority, and right to explore, develop, and utilize the natural resources, including surface and subsurface and nonrenewable resources in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

The protection, conservation, rehabilitation, and development of forests, coastal and marine resources, including the adoption of programs and projects, to ensure the maintenance of ecological balance and biodiversity, shall be given priority.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
