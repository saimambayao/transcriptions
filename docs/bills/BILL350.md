**UPGRADING THE DR. SERAPIO B. MONTANER JR., AL HAJ MEMORIAL HOSPITAL (DSBMMH) FROM 25 TO 100 BED CAPACITY (LEVEL II), APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Quality healthcare is a subjective, complex and multi-dimensional concept. According to an Iranian Researcher, Ali Mohammad Mosadeghrad, quality healthcare as “consistently delighting the patient by providing efficacious, effective and efficient healthcare services based on the latest clinical guidelines and standards, which meet the patient’s needs and satisfies health providers”.

Delivery of quality and enhanced health care services requires an advanced medical equipment, highly complex diagnostic and therapeutic approach including expert handling of capacitated manpower that can provide efficient delivery of service and medical attention to patients in need.

Dr. Serapio B. Montaner Jr. Al - Haj Memorial Hospital (DSBMMH) is a government run hospital located in Malabang Municipality, Lanao del Sur, has been upgraded into level 2 with 100 authorized bed capacity since June 29, 2022 under Republic Act No. 11870. The DSBMMH consistently has the highest number of patients served among the five (5) BARMM government - run hospitals in the province of Lanao del Sur augmenting the hospitals in and around Lanao del Sur, serving 1.2 Million people. According to the 2019 Hospital Statistical Report of the Ministry of Health, the 75 bed DSBMMH provided care way above its bed capacity. In the last 3 years, the hospital bed occupancy rate was computed to be around 300-400% despite the absence of any fund augmentation to the hospital Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) and other financial support from the government except for Philhealth reimbursement, offering services that include General Medical, Pediatric and Surgical services, Ophthalmology, Obstetrical and Gynecological services and Anesthesiology.

Upgrading of Dr. Serapio B. Montaner Jr. Al Haj Memorial Hospital with its corresponding provision of appropriate manpower is a timely and outstanding measure that this entails more responsibilities, accountabilities and resource mobilization, both financial, infrastructure as pledged by the national government and human resource.

The Bangsamoro Transition Authority and the Office of the Chief Minister through the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Finance, and Budget Management play a crucial role to achieve a better, efficient and quality health system.

To effectively respond to the present gaps and challenges of the DSBMMH this measure becomes a matter of utmost consideration of the Government of the Day to approve and enact. As such, this bill is deemed necessary to increase human resources and hospital logistics and further enhance the delivery of improved health services attaining quality health care for all in Lanao del Sur and nearby provinces.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.

**Chunk Complete. Ready for next group of provisions starting at the enacting clause of BTA BILL NO. 350.**
