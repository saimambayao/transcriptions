**AN ACT**
**ESTABLISHING A SCHOLARSHIP AND RETURN SERVICE PROGRAM FOR DESERVING STUDENTS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The 1987 Philippine Constitution established the following fundamental guarantees:

*   “The State shall protect and promote the right of the citizens to quality education at all levels and shall take appropriate steps to make such education accessible to all.” (Sec. 1, Art. XIV)
*   “The State shall establish and maintain a system of scholarship grants, student loan programs, subsidies, and other incentives which shall be available to deserving students in both public and private schools, especially to the underprivileged.” (Sec. 2, Art. XIV)

Higher education contributes largely in the development of competent and high-level human resources and generates knowledge and technologies needed for development and for advancing competitiveness. Higher education serves as the link between basic education and the professional world, thus its contribution towards the development of human capital in BARMM cannot be overlooked.

Increasing the access of the Bangsamoro constituents on higher education is one of the major challenges of the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education (MBHTE)-CHED. This challenge is compounded by the armed conflict and other peace and order related problems in the region.

One way of promoting access is giving scholarships or financial assistance to deserving students. However, scholarship programs in the region, specifically the Student Financial Assistance Programs (StuFAPs) is being managed by the CHED Central Office. Slots provided to the BARMM depends on how CHED allocates slots among the regions.

This measure aims to address this problem. This bill mandates the establishment of a Bangsamoro Scholarship and Return Service Program for deserving students who wish to pursue education and training in any State University and College in the country.

It also includes a provision for return service where after graduating from the SUC, the scholar shall be integrated into the Bangsamoro Government and shall receive the appropriate civil service rank, salary and related benefits. This will not only be beneficial to the scholar but has a reciprocal benefit to the government through the gainful employment of competent professionals and public servants for the region.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
