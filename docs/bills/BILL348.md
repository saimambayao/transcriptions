**AN ACT ENSURING SAFE AND CLEAN DRINKING WATER AND ADEQUATE SANITATION FACILITIES IN SCHOOLS WITHIN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM), PROVIDING FUNDS FOR THE PURPOSE, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

A safe and healthy school environment is foundational to students' ability to learn, thrive, and succeed. Access to clean water, adequate sanitation, and hygiene facilities is essential to achieving this environment, yet in BARMM, many students attend schools where basic WASH facilities are lacking. Without access to clean drinking water and proper sanitation, students are exposed to heightened risks of waterborne diseases, which drive up absenteeism and disrupt their educational progress.

Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) shows that schools with inadequate WASH facilities can see absenteeism rates increase by up to 25%, as preventable illnesses force students to miss valuable learning time¹.

The lack of clean water and proper sanitation in BARMM schools is well-documented. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), only 56% of urban and 28% of rural households in BARMM have access to piped water or an improved water source as of 2020, making it one of the most water-insecure regions in the Philippines. Similarly, only 52% of households in BARMM have access to basic sanitation facilities. These figures paint a dire picture for schools, which often face even greater constraints than households. A 2021 assessment by the WinS Program revealed that only half of BARMM schools met minimum WASH standards, leaving thousands of students in facilities without safe water or functioning sanitation infrastructure².

For female students, inadequate WASH facilities further exacerbate educational barriers, especially during menstruation. A UNESCO study highlights that girls are more likely to miss school in areas with poor sanitation facilities, often due to lack of privacy and access to clean toilets³. In BARMM, this challenge compounds existing gender disparities in education, impacting not only academic performance but also retention rates for female students.

The WinS Program has demonstrated that investing in WASH facilities leads to improved health, reduced absenteeism, and enhanced academic performance. Schools equipped with WinS-compliant facilities report up to a 30% decrease in absenteeism due to reduced cases of waterborne and hygiene-related illnesses. Beyond physical health, the program fosters a learning environment where students can practice and internalize essential hygiene behaviors. This Act builds upon these principles, ensuring that BARMM schools have the region-specific WASH infrastructure necessary to support students' health and learning.

The mandate for such provisions is rooted in the 1987 Philippine Constitution, which requires the State to "protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them" (Article II, Section 15) and to "promote the right of all citizens to quality education at all levels" (Article XIV, Section 1). Moreover, the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) reinforces the BARMM Government's obligation to provide quality education and promote the health and well-being of all Bangsamoro constituents. Article IX, Section 14 of the BOL asserts the Bangsamoro Government's role in ensuring accessible and quality educational conditions, directly tying health to the educational environment.

The BARMM Water Safety in Schools Act is therefore a critical intervention that addresses the immediate needs of BARMM students for safe drinking water, adequate sanitation, and essential hygiene education. It aligns with constitutional and regional mandates while addressing a documented gap that directly affects students' ability to attend and succeed in school. By localizing the WinS principles to meet the specific needs of BARMM, this Act will ensure that all students in the region have the opportunity to learn in a safe, dignified, and supportive environment. The passage of this Act represents a foundational step towards fulfilling BARMM's commitment to quality education and public health, shaping a healthier, more resilient future for the region.

In light of the foregoing, the immediate passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
