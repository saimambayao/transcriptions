**AN ACT ESTABLISHING INDIGENOUS PEOPLE’S COMMUNITY CENTERS IN THE BANGSAMORO REGION AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is the model definition of a melting pot of cultures that encompasses the Philippines. In it, several unique Indigenous Communities and Indigenous people exist, each with their unique identity, religion, and ethnicity, all of which are protected by no less than the constitution as Filipinos and by the Bangsamoro Organic Law as enshrined in its general principles and policies (Section 10, Article IV). These Indigenous Communities have their own inimitable ways, traditions, and needs which are best served by local heads within their communities. Currently, there exists an opportunity for the Bangsamoro Government to better serve these Indigenous Communities in order to ensure that they are involved in the decision-making process, which would greatly impact their communities.

This Bill aims to bridge the gap between the Indigenous People within our region and the Bangsamoro Government. Through the establishment of these community centers, our constituents belonging to the Indigenous Communities will have unabated access to government amenities without the tension of being discriminated against by reason of their belief, ethnicity, race, custom, sex, and any other reason as these centers will be run by the Indigenous communities themselves. These centers will also be the gateway for our indigenous communities to voice out their concerns and needs so that the Bangsamoro Government will be able to appropriately address said concerns and tailor-fit each action to the specific needs of our Indigenous Communities.

With the proximity of amenities brought about by these community centers, our indigenous communities may also showcase their distinct cultures by embellishing these establishments with materials and products which are unique to their communities, which empowers them while also preserving their individualities.

In view of the foregoing, this representation is seeking for the early passage of this bill into law.
