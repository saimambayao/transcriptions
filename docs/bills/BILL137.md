**AN ACT INSTITUTING A MECHANISM TO REGULATE AND MANAGE THE LIGAWASAN RESOURCES FOR BALANCED AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND THEREBY CREATING THE LIGAWASAN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY, DEFINING ITS POWERS AND FUNCTIONS, PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Ligawasan marsh — or simply *Ligawasan* in the Maguindanao language, which this bill also endeavors to popularize in order to bolster the distinctiveness and historical significance of the place — is the largest wetland in the Philippines, comprising about 10% of the Mindanao river basin¹, covering a total area of 288,000 hectares spread across the provinces of Maguindanao del Sur, Maguindanao del Norte, North Cotabato and Sultan Kudarat with approximately 100,000 families living therein.²

In the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, crucial portions of the Ligawasan biogeographic zone are areas of responsibility of eleven (11) local governments of the province of Maguindanao del Sur namely the municipalities of Ampatuan, Datu Piang, Talitay, Pagalungan, Datu Montawal, Buluan, Pandag, Mangudadatu, Datu Paglas, Paglat, and SK Pendatun; the three (3) municipal governments of the province of Maguindanao del Norte that include the municipalities of Mother Kabuntalan, Northern Kabuntalan and Southern Kabuntalan; and a significant number of barangays of the Special Geographic Area (SGA) particularly those from the municipalities of Pikit, Midsayap and Pigcawayan that were annexed to the Bangsamoro autonomous region in the February 6, 2019 plebiscite.

The Ligawasan complex is a distinct and unique region among the fifteen (15) biogeographic regions of the Philippines considering its significant number of fauna (vegetation) and flora (wildlife) species. Records show that the complex supports a variety of vegetation that includes species of endangered water-subsisting native trees, bushes, and other wild undergrowth species. It also is a haven of a significant number of wildlife species that include herons, egrets, rails, shorebirds, ducks and other wild waterbird genus; mudfish, catfish, ells and other classes of endangered native fishes; and the famous but vanishing Philippine crocodile, bats and other water habituated wild animals.³

The corpus of vegetation and wildlife genera in the Ligawasan enclave has historical significance to the Maguindanaon dwellers, being a part of their life for their social and economic survival since time immemorial; and the area itself as one of their major havens especially during the height of the contemporary Bangsamoro struggle to self-determination. However, the continuous exploitation and utilization of these natural resources by the dwellers without alternative actions to sustain their instinct existence is a threat to the preservation of the dwellers’ historical existence in the area and its ecosystem. Hence, there is a need to protect these endangered fauna and flora species.

The Department of Energy and Natural Resources (DENR) drafted its “Management Plan for Ligawasan Marsh Protected Area” in 2019.⁴ However, this attempt still remains latent until now, feasibly due to the fact that the marsh was a war-torn area for decades, and the absence of duly instituted and reputable Authority that shall regulate the use of these resources. In effect, the residents uncontrollably exploit the resources, especially the fishes, animals and water-surviving tree species as sources of their livelihood. Also, the utilization of the land by the farmer-residents with their traditional farming practices essentially disturbed the habitats of these biological species. Thus, there is a need to urgently address the problem so that these resources, in addition to their historical and environmental significance, will provide sustainable economic benefits to the constituents, the region and the country.

In addition, the marsh is believed to have natural gas and oil deposits. Thus, the state-owned Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC) with its Malaysian counterpart, the Petronas, conducted a joint exploration in 1990s and confirmed the presence of the hidden natural wealth. According to a report released by the investor now seeking to develop the gas fields, data from the Philippine Department of Energy (DOE) indicate that three (3) of the wells identified by the PNOC-Petronas joint exploration venture have combined estimated recoverable resources of 202 million barrels of oil ($16.2 billion at current prices). Some 821 million cubic feet of natural gas reserves have been identified; and potential resources are estimated to amount to another six (6) billion cubic feet. With gas prices currently at around $10 per 1,000 cubic feet, the marsh’s proven reserves are likely to be worth around $8 million.⁵

In spite of the wealth opportunities in the Ligawasan enclave, its natural gas and oil deposits remained untapped until today for two evident reasons: (a) the marsh was a hotspot during the decades of conflict between the Philippine government and the major Bangsamoro revolutionary groups such as the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in most parts of the marsh, and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) in some other portions of the area; and, (b) some fear this extractive activity will damage the ecosystem of the marsh, and possibly exacerbate land conflict in an area where land tenure is already complex and contested.⁶

The first problem such as the decades-old conventional armed conflict between the government and the revolutionary Moro groups might have been addressed, either partially or totally, by the fractional execution of the earlier GRP-MNLF agreements and the orderly implementation of the GPH-MILF peace pacts which led the MNLF and MILF, respectively, to join the Philippine government in instituting a paradigm shift of the Moro revolution from armed struggle to political exertion in fulfilling a truly self-determined Bangsamoro governance – a common impression as the best alternative solution at this time to reign justpeace and sustainable development in the homeland. Meanwhile, the second problem, i.e. the degenerating ecosystem of the marsh, can be essentially dealt with through the development and execution of sensible mechanisms and programs, and the creation of a government arm that shall spearhead the translation of the “natural resources founded” wealth-generating opportunities into corporeality.

In response to the foregoing ordeals, this bill has been proposed as a legal instrument to regulate and effectively manage the exploration and development of the natural resources (both fauna and flora) of the Ligawasan complex within the political expanses of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, including the rationalization, utilization, restoration and conservation of these resources; and eventually the attempt to reign balanced and sustainable development in the area where the entitlement of the affected communities for normal socioeconomic and cultural existence is protected and sustained, a complete ecological justice and environment quality are maintained, and equitable accessibility of these natural resources to the different sectors of the present as well as the future generations is guaranteed. Toward this end, a serviceable workplace such as the **“Ligawasan Development Authority”** as this bill proposes; and effective institutional and program control and management mechanisms, as also contained in this bill, shall be established to ensure timely preparation, proper administration, and rigorous coordination and collaboration of related programs, projects and activities that shall optimize the exploration and utilization of the Ligawasan natural resources, while ensuring their protection, preservation and sustenance at the same time.

This bill has the following salient features:

(a) It promotes **“human resource localization”** where **“qualified”** bonafide residents of the Ligawasan enclave shall, whenever possible, be prioritized from top to bottom management positions in the LDA. This is to ensure occupational justice for them, and to expect the likelihood that they have the reflective commitment to sustain sound environment as they will be directly affected when it goes wrong.

(b) It encourages **“participatory decision-making and management”**, as evidenced in the equitable representation of different sectors, including the participation of the concerned ministries and offices of BARMM in the Ligawasan Development Board (LDB) as ex-officio members. The bills assumes that adopting this strategy will result to increase in team morale, promote dynamic collaboration, discover creative solutions, teams more readily accept decisions, and improve Authority-community relationships.

(c) It attempts to **“generate sustainable income without sacrificing the environment”** for the benefits not only of the Ligawasan communities and the region but the country as well. This **“balanced development-environment mechanism”** is evident in the bill’s attempt to regulate and effectively manage the exploration and development of the natural resources of the Ligawasan complex and, at the same time, to rationalize, utilize, restore and conserve these resources; and, eventually to reign balanced and sustainable development in the area.

This bill is founded on the following provisions of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), either in their entirety or fraction thereof:

(a) **Article XIII of the BOL** *(pp. 77-78)* particularly in

- **Section 9** *(Transfer Management of Existing Nature Reserves and Protected Areas);*
- **Section 10** *(Exploration, Development and Utilization of Fossil Fuels and Uranium;*
- **Section 11** *(Preferential Rights of Bona Fide Residents of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region; and*
- **Section 12** *(Rights of the Indigenous People to Natural Resources,*

(b) **Sec. 38, Art. VII of the BOL** *(p. 30)* granting the Bangsamoro Government the power to create offices and organize its own bureaucracy, and may establish offices and institutions necessary for the exercise of its functions and delivery of social services in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region

Program-wise, this bill supports the commitment of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) to sustainable peace and development in the region as manifested among others in the Bangsamoro government’s **“12-Point Agenda for 2023-2025”**⁷ particularly but not limited to the following items, either entirely or partly:

(a) **Item No. 3** *(Revenue generation and economic comparative advantage),*
(b) **Item No. 4** *(Agri-fishery productivity and food security),*
(c) **Item No. 5** *(Investment in transportation, communication, and other strategic infrastructure),*
(d) **Item No. 6** *(Energy security),* and
(e) **Item No. 11** *(Peace, justice and security).*

Mindful of the significance of a well-regulated and managed Ligawasan natural resources to recuperate the political, social, cultural and economic existence of the constituents and communities in the Area, and the potential contribution of the Area to economic growth of the region and the country; and thinking further that normalization is now getting better in the Area in effect of the orderly implementation of the GRP-MILF agreements and other fulfilled accords between the government and the MNLF; and considering finally the legal foundations of this bill and its promising support to the realization of BTA’s 12-point Agenda for 2023-2025, it is the **PRAYER** of this proposed legislation for its expeditious passage in the Bangsamoro parliament. Hence, the support of the members of the Bangsamoro Parliament is earnestly sought.

Insha Allah, the realization of this bill will create breakthroughs in the institutionalization of justpeace, alongside with balanced and sustainable economic development in the Area and the rest of the Bangsamoro region being its domino effect, and consequently the rebirth of a normal Bangsamoro society particularly in the Ligawasan enclave and its peripheries.
