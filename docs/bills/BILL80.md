**AN ACT**
**INCENTIVIZING SEAWEED FARMING IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Among the flora in Asia Pacific Regions, the Philippine seaweed is exceptionally diverse. It is the primary commodity produced by the Philippine fisheries and aquaculture sector with 1.499 million metric tons. It is also the second top export commodity contributing 33.33% to the total fisheries production in 2020. The gross value of seaweed production in 2020 amounted to 10.60 billion pesos.¹

The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) shares 46.5% of the total aquaculture production of seaweed, making them the top producer in the Philippines. The total production of BARMM for aquaculture increased by 2.19 percent during the first quarter of 2021, that is from 213,228.43 metric tons (MT) in Q1 2020 to 217,900.97 MT in Q1 2021. About 83.28 percent of the total aquaculture production in BARMM was composed of seaweeds. Its production increased by 6.29 percent between the first quarters of 2020 and 2021.²

Seaweed farming is the primary livelihood source for coastal villagers, particularly in the BARMM. It is considered a family venture involving nearly all family members, including children. It utilizes between 100,000-200,000 labors, where 90% are seaweed farmers, and the rest are seaweed processors and traders.³

Farming of seaweeds is usually dependent on the availability of capital in order to start farming. In Tawi-Tawi, one of the problems that hindered farmers from intensifying seaweed farming was the lack of capital and government support, which resulted in low socio-economic status.

This measure seeks to reduce the wealth inequality in the seaweed value chain and create shared value among the private companies and local communities in the BARMM by institutionalizing the Seaweed Farming Development Program. This program shall make use of science-based technologies in the promotion and development of the seaweed farming industry in the region.

This proposed bill will incentivize the region’s seaweed farmers through the improvement of their production and productivity. This includes seaweed farming extension services, skills development, provision of production inputs, equipment, facilities, and infrastructure for production and post-production activities. This also provides for business support and development services, particularly in the areas of access to markets, marketing, and networking.

It focuses on generating equitable and sustainable relations between the vulnerable seaweed farmers, and influence local policies and practices in the seaweed farming industry. This proposed bill will support the region’s poorest and most vulnerable communities through sustainable rural development, access to markets, the collaboration between public and private sectors, and microfinance.

It will also incorporate into the program measures to strengthen the seaweed farmers’ entrepreneurial and decision-making skills by helping them craft a trade agreement to access markets and fair prices that will help reduce wealth inequality, develop a competitive and desirable marketing agreement among seaweed farmers, processors, and traders, and implement measures on sound environmental management, addressing both sustainable seaweed farming and marine conservation.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
