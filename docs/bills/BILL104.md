**AN ACT ESTABLISHING A LEVEL I GENERAL HOSPITAL IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF TIPO-TIPO, PROVINCE OF BASILAN, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

A healthy population is vital to progress and development, and it is part of the mandate of government to ensure that its people have access to health care services, systems and facilities that uphold their constitutionally-protected and universal right to good health. This is true in Tipo-Tipo, one of the municipalities in the island province of Basilan, where access to basic health care services is still difficult and needs improvement.

The municipality of Tipo-Tipo is a third-class municipality in the province of Basilan. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 25,531 people across 4,195 households. It is part of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) and hosts 11 barangays covering 49.7 square kilometers. The poverty incidence in this municipality was recorded as 76.61% as of 2018. Among the many factors that affect the prevalence of poverty is poor health, as poor health affects a person’s ability to earn and be productive, as well as being an expensive burden few people can afford. Providing easily-accessible, affordable and excellent health care services for the people is one of the steps we must take to address and eliminate poverty among our people. This is true of Tipo-Tipo.

This municipality has one barangay health center, and the nearest public hospitals are the 25-bed Lamitan District hospital, which is 13 kilometers away and; the 25-bed Basilan General Hospital, which is 28 kilometers away. Patients whose healthcare needs cannot be served by the barangay health center, especially urgent-care cases, must travel these distances to receive hospital-based care, delaying their treatment. Those hospitals are also in need of upgrades to their capabilities and capacities, as they have been operating beyond capacity already.

This bill aims to bring health care closer to the people who need it the most, and to fulfill the BARMM mandate to provide easily-accessible, adequate, excellent and effective health care services to the people of Tipo-Tipo. Our people have the right to ease of access to health care services that enable them to live healthy and productive lives. Our mandate in BARMM, as provided for in both the 1987 Constitution and the Bangsamoro Organic Law, will best be preserved by building a level-1 hospital in this municipality that will improve access to much-needed hospital care, as well as share the load of the already over-burdened hospitals in the province of Basilan.

It is in this context of urgency and need that we seek the passage of this.
