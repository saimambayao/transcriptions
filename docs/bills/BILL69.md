**AN ACT**
**GRANTING RECOGNITION AND INCENTIVES TO BANGSAMORO TOPNOTCHERS (TOP 1 TO TOP 10) OF BOARD, BAR AND OTHER NATIONAL LICENSURE EXAMINATIONS, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Bangsamoro Government has been steadfast in recognizing the achievements of its outstanding constituents in their respective fields of profession. Bangsamoro topnotchers bring pride, honor, and serve as an inspiration to the youth. However, the government understands the difficulties endured and the efforts exerted by every board or bar candidate.

Every board, bar, or any other national licensure examination candidate has experienced, in one way or another, a staggering test of mettle through a gauntlet of hardships, adversities, and pressures, much more now amid the concerns brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Not only do they experience these burdens but it takes a heavy toll on them mentally, economically, and spiritually. Consequently, the accomplishment of these candidates to place on top of the rankings is an impressive feat worthy of emulation and public acknowledgment.

Thus, the enactment of this measure for the due recognition of topnotchers. as well as to provide them with benefits, privileges, and a respectable amount which will serve as a cash incentive for topnotchers is proper and reasonable.

The granting of recognition and incentives to the Bangsamoro people and other inhabitants in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is one way of inspiring individuals to strive for greater heights of excellence.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
