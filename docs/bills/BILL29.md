***

¹ This language is patterned after two national laws namely: Section 1 of the OEC and Section 1 of the LGC of 1991. There is redundancy of the term ‘Bangsamoro’ in the original provision.
² This proposed additional provision is intended to emphasize the nature of BARMM as a parliamentary ministerial government. Therefore, any construction or interpretation must be contextualized with the parliamentary ministerial form of government of the BARMM.
³ Source: Art. 2(13), Electoral Code of Macedonia.
⁴ See Part I(2), Elections Act 1958 (Malaysia).
⁵ Define general assemblies and party conventions.
⁶ Refer also to provisions on registration of parties. Parties shall continue to conduct general assemblies and party conventions even if they lose in the elections. This is a continuing requirement if they wish to participate further in future parliamentary elections.
⁷ Define turncoatism.
⁸ Instead of ‘Commission en banc’, the proposed amendment used ‘Commission’. The reason is that the Comelec en banc does not usually take cognizance of cases in the first instance. Subject to exceptions, the general rule is that the Comelec always acts in the first instance through its divisions.
⁹ Surge in the list of registered voters is not illegal per se. To cause the delisting, there must be some valid grounds provided by law like in the case of double or multiple registrants.
¹⁰ Define OEC.
¹¹ Define Committee.

¹⁴ on the basis of number of members every branch?
¹⁵ This is a proposed additional power of the General Party Committee.
¹⁶ A party may not be compelled by any authority in the recruitment of their members. It is the sole prerogative of the party to recruit which no authority can reverse.(Transferred with amendment to Section 12)
¹⁷ This amendment proposes that only the winning parties (those garnering at least 4% of the total valid votes cast in the party system) shall be entitled to additional seats. Though this is a departure from the BANAT formula, yet it is submitted that the proposal is more consistent with a parliamentary form of government in which party domination is expected. The BANAT formula is applicable to the House of Representatives which is strikingly different from a parliament. As observed in other parliamentary democracies, the winning party or coalition of parties is given effective control of the government because losing parties are not allocated these so called “additional seats”. These losing parties are merely that – losing parties. They lost in the party system elections. They did not obtain at least 4%. The electorate have chosen the winning party or parties to be the government of the day.

²¹ This proposed provision will ensure that the sectoral representative truly represents his/her sector not only by mere membership in the sector but also by actual advocacy for his/her sector.

⁶² In practice, the Commission lowers the ‘threshold’ to authorize Board of Canvassers to proclaim winning candidates on the basis of incomplete canvass.
⁶³ In view of the automated election system, there are only two issues that may be raised in pre- proc: a) illegal composition of the Board of Canvassers, and b) illegal proceedings of the Board of Canvassers. Incomplete returns is not a ground for pre-proc under the automated election system because no proclamation can be had without the canvass being completed in the first place. This is why in case of incomplete canvass where the winning candidate/s is no longer affected by results which are yet to be canvassed, proclamation is allowed only when the COMELEC lowers the threshold. Based on experience in the past automated elections, it seems that Par. c of the proposed provision is also not a ground for pre- proc under the automated election system.
⁶⁴ In accordance with Sec. 256, as amended by Sec. 2(2), Art. IX-C, 1987 Constitution, and as modified by Sec. 22, R.A. 7166.
