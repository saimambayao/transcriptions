**AN ACT GRANTING CASH INCENTIVES AND RECOGNITION TO BANGSAMORO TOPNOTCHERS, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Section 2 (3), Article XIV of the 1987 Constitution mandates the establishment and maintenance of an incentive system, among others, which shall be available to deserving students in both public and private schools, especially to the underprivileged.

The Bangsamoro Government has consistently honored the achievements of its exceptional constituents in their respective fields of work and professions. And the *Bangsamoro Topnotcher Act of 2023* is one way of expressing gratitude for the honor and pride that the Bangsamoro topnotchers bring to the Bangsamoro through their remarkable performance in their academic pursuits.

The Bangsamoro Parliament approved and adopted Proposed Resolution Nos. 260, 261, 203, 218, 234, 257, 295, and 309 commending and congratulating Nishrien Amatonding Barua, Al-Zaheer Adil Abubakar, Hamid Simpal Salik, Benjamin Rinabor, Piamae Keil Roslin, Nur-Hafieza Jannah I. Abinal, Yasser Binsuan, and Abdul Baterbonia Lumanggal, respectively for being topnotchers in the national licensure examinations. They have followed in the footsteps of Atty. Macapanton Abbas Sr., Atty. Kamar M. Boloto, Atty. Gafar E. Lutian, Atty. Mylene Amerol-Macumbal, and Atty. Princess Fatima Parahiman landed Top 2 in the Philippine bar exam.

Rewarding systems have often been used to help improve students’ academic achievements. The desire for the reward develops a healthy learning habit and generates interest, which leads to effort and results.

In accordance with the above-mentioned mandate, a *Bangsamoro Topnotcher Act of 2023* will be institutionalized in order to recognize the competence and brilliance of the Bangsamoro and to ensure the continuation of a legacy in the academe.

This will also serve as an inspiration to the graduates to strive for excellence in their respective fields and endeavors. The recognition to be accorded to these topnotchers deserves emulation and, therefore, is worthy of public acknowledgment.

In light of the vital significance of education in nation-building, the approval of this bill is earnestly sought.
