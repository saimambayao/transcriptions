**Explanatory Note**

***"If anyone relieves a Muslim believer from one of the hardships of this worldly life, Allah will relieve him of one of the hardships of the Day of Resurrection. If anyone makes it easy for the one who is indebted to him (while finding it difficult to repay), Allah will make it easy for him in this worldly life and in the Hereafter, and if anyone conceals the faults of a Muslim, Allah will conceal his faults in this world and in the Hereafter. Allah helps His slave as long as he helps his brother."***

– The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), as narrated by Abu Hurairah (RAA) in Hadith 36, as related by Muslim

The Philippines is a country prone to natural calamities and disasters, especially with the worsening effects of global warming and climate change. In the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, it is a woeful reality that we are beset by mother nature’s worst: typhoons, floods, landslides, earthquakes, droughts, and the like, man-made hazards like widespread fires, and even more sadly, the very worst of human-induced disasters, the terrible tribulations brought about by extremist militant groups.

As an awful offshoot of these disasters, so many people lose their livelihood, their loved ones, and their homes. We have seen so many people flee from their homes because of these disasters, and as a result, they become what are called “internally displaced persons” or IDPs. According to the United Nations’ Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR), citing the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, IDPs are persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized border.”¹

A prime example and one of the worst cases of displacement that our region has experienced began in May of 2017, when an awful crisis dawned upon the City of Marawi. According to Bermudez, et. al., in an article written in 2018 titled “*A disaster approach to displacement: IDPs in the Philippines*” by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, an armed encounter between the Philippines’ armed forces and the Islamic State-inspired Maute Group that lasted for five months displaced around 360,000 people from Marawi. In the same article, it is acknowledged that the Philippines has no laws relating directly to IDPs and instead, there are only legal guidelines for the State’s response in cases of displacement, based on Republic Act (R.A.) No. 10121, otherwise known as the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010. However, the law has its limitations, like being about structures and response actors, and not enough about displaced persons.²

This proposed legislative measure attempts to address an essential question that directly pertains to displaced persons. Given that they are forced to flee their homes and as they wait for their area to be declared safe to return to or while rebuilding or restoring efforts are still ongoing, where do displaced persons go? Where can they seek shelter? Where can they be kept safe whilst they are away from their homes?

R.A. No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), under Article V, Section 2(s), vests authority to the Bangsamoro Government over matters involving disaster risk reduction and management, without prejudice to the general supervision of the President. Moreover, Section 3 of the same article provides for the important provision on general welfare. It provides:

**Section 3. *General Welfare.*** – The Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the powers expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and **those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare**. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and **preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants.**

In relation to this provision, Article VII, Section 5(a) of the BOL cites as one of the powers of the Bangsamoro Parliament, the power to “enact laws to promote, protect, and ensure the general welfare of the Bangsamoro people and other inhabitants in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.” Moreover, as part of social justice, Article IX of the BOL, which provides for basic rights, states in its Section 8 that:

**Section 8. *Right of Access to Basic Services.*** – The Bangsamoro Government shall provide, maintain, and ensure the delivery of basic and responsive health programs, quality education, appropriate services, livelihood opportunities, affordable and progressive housing projects, power and electricity, and water inhabitants of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. **It shall maintain appropriate disaster-preparedness units for immediate and effective relief services to victims of natural and man-made calamities.** It shall also ensure the rehabilitation of calamity-affected areas and victims of calamities.

More than these provisions, Article XIII, Section 7 of the same law states “[t]he Bangsamoro Government recognizes the importance of disaster risk reduction and management and climate change adaptation.”

To answer the basic questions cited before, in current practice, most often, schools, gymnasiums, covered courts, and multipurpose buildings serve as evacuation centers during disasters. Furthermore, there are times when temporary tents made of indigenous materials and recycled items such as used tarpaulins, and plastic items are being used as temporary shelter of IDPs during disasters especially human-induced disasters, with limited access to water, plumbing, and sanitation. These are not conducive places to temporarily take shelter in.

IDPs are already suffering enough with so many losses on their part. Their family life has been disrupted, their security is at risk, the children’s education is interrupted, elderly people and people with special needs are all the more challenged with their disabilities, and their health is compromised from being exposed to such disasters places them in a very vulnerable position. The least that the government can do for them and their dignity is to provide clean, safe, and spacious places for them to temporarily stay at. They should have access to plumbing and to clean water, to facilities that cater to women, especially mothers who are breastfeeding, and elderly people and people with special needs, and overall, to an acceptable temporary living situation.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
