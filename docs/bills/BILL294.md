**AN ACT**
**ENSURING EQUITABLE HEALTHCARE ACCESS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO THROUGH THE CREATION OF THE BANGSAMORO MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR INDIGENT PATIENTS, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

A significant segment of the population in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao faces financial constraints hindering their access to private healthcare facilities. In many instances, indigent patients are compelled to seek medical care in private hospitals due to various reasons, such as specialized treatments or the unavailability of services in public healthcare institutions.

This proposed legislation is driven by the imperative to bridge the financial gap for indigent patients residing in the Bangsamoro Region, particularly those seeking medical attention in private hospitals. By establishing a targeted medical assistance program, this Author aims to facilitate and enhance their access to quality health and medical services, thereby ensuring definitive medical interventions or management.

The act delineates a clear framework encompassing eligibility criteria, the application process, fund allocation mechanisms, and robust oversight measures. Emphasizing residency and financial need, the eligibility criteria is designed to prioritize those facing the most acute medical needs while maintaining transparency and fairness. The legislation also establishes mechanisms for regular reporting, and monitoring, ensuring the effective and accountable implementation of the medical aid program.

By addressing the financial impediments faced by indigent patients seeking medical care in private hospitals, this legislation aspires to weave a safety net that ensures no individual is left behind in their pursuit of necessary and life-changing medical interventions.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
