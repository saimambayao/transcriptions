**AN ACT PROVIDING WELLNESS, THROUGH THE CONDUCT OF WEEKLY PHYSICAL CONDITIONING ACTIVITIES, FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Physical fitness is an essential component of overall health and well-being. Research shows that regular physical activity not only improves physical health but also contributes to mental and emotional well-being. Taking up exercise reduces the risk of developing mental illness. It also helps in treating some mental health conditions, like depression and anxiety. For example, for mild-moderate depression, research suggests physical activity can be as effective as antidepressants or psychological treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy. Exercise can also be a valuable addition to other treatment options.¹

The Bangsamoro Government, through the Bangsamoro Organic Law, promises to protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them.²

It is also enshrined under Republic Act No. 11036 (R.A. 11036), or the “Mental Health Act,” that the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and Civil Service Commission (CSC) have the duty to develop policies, guidelines, and standards to promote mental health in the workplace.

Employees render a minimum of 40 work hours a week. Due to the fatigue proximately caused by the long period of office work, most of the employees cannot allot time for themselves for their physical conditioning.

As the Bangsamoro Region breaks the stigma surrounding mental health in the workplace, it is necessary to establish programs that not only raise awareness about mental health issues but also provide solutions to this longstanding problem. And thus, the submission of this bill.

This Act seeks to promote a culture of physical fitness among the workers of Bangsamoro Region, through its ministries, offices, and agencies. It aims to encourage individuals to engage in regular physical activity, which can lead to improved health outcomes, increased productivity and enhanced overall quality of life. It is hoped that this measure will not only improve the health and well-being of individuals but also contribute to the overall development of the Bangsamoro region.
