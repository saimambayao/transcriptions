**AN ACT**
**MANDATING THE CONSTRUCTION OF SOLAR-POWERED WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is an area of the Philippines that has long been grappling with water scarcity and inadequate water distribution infrastructure. The region's predominantly rural and remote communities face significant challenges in accessing safe and potable water, which affects the overall health, well-being, and economic opportunities of its residents.

The purpose of this legislation is to formulate a three-year program for the construction of solar-powered water distribution systems in every barangay throughout the region. These systems will utilize solar energy as the primary power source to pump and distribute water to communities, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and minimizing the environmental impact.

This legislation mandates the Bangsamoro Government to facilitate the installation of solar-powered water distribution systems in identified areas with limited access to clean water. Aside from this, the legislation encourages partnerships between the regional government, relevant agencies, constituent LGUs, and local communities to ensure efficient implementation and management of solar-powered water distribution systems. It promotes community participation, capacity building, and the empowerment of local stakeholders.

The passage of this legislative measure will have several significant benefits. First and foremost, it will improve the quality of life for residents in the BARMM by providing reliable and sustainable access to clean water, reducing waterborne diseases, and enhancing hygiene practices. Moreover, the use of solar power will contribute to the region's overall energy sustainability, reduce carbon emissions, and promote the utilization of renewable energy sources.

By providing a sustainable solution to the water crisis while promoting renewable energy, this legislation aims to uplift the living conditions of the residents and contribute to the region's development.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.

c. The concerned LGU shall participate in the project planning, identification, design, construction, and monitoring;
d. The water supply system shall be managed and maintained by the LGU concerned;
e. The water supply system shall be constructed with the end view of ensuring universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water, increasing water-use efficiency, ensuring sustainable withdrawals and supply, and substantially reducing the number of people suffering from water scarcity.

**Section 5. Construction of Water Supply Systems from Traditional Sources.** – The Local Government Unit of the area where the water supply system is located shall ensure that it is conserved and its quality maintained by formulating policies that are not in contravention to customary or religious practices associated with that particular traditional water source.

**Section 6. Implementing Rules and Regulations.** Within ninety (90) days upon approval of this Act, the Ministry of Science and Technology, in coordination with the Ministry of Public Works and the Ministry of Interior and Local Government, shall promulgate the necessary rules and regulations for the effective implementation of the provisions of this Act.
