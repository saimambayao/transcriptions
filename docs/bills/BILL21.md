**Section 1. Short Title.** — This Act shall be known as the “Bangsamoro Armed Conflict Human Rights Violations Documentation Act.”

Declaration of Policy.** — Section 2 of Article II of the 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines declares that the State adopts generally accepted principles of international law as part of the law of the land. Section 11 of Article II of the Constitution declares that the State values the dignity of every human person and guarantees full respect for human rights. By virtue of these provisions, the State adheres to international human rights laws and conventions, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and the International Humanitarian Laws.

Pursuant to these, and taking into account the Report of the interim Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Commission in March 2015, it is hereby declared the policy of the Bangsamoro Government to enact mechanisms to address the past human rights violations committed against the Bangsamoro people and non-moro indigenous peoples and other past and present inhabitants of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region with a view to promoting healing and reconciliation using the ‘dealing with the past’ framework.

As an initial step towards this end, it is the obligation of the Bangsamoro Government to acknowledge the violations of international human rights laws and the international humanitarian law committed against these persons during the decades of armed conflict in Mindanao, including those committed by State actors and by State-affiliated armed groups, through a systematic and permanent mechanism of documentation.

Furthermore, it is the obligation of the Bangsamoro Government to recognize the individual victims of these human rights violations to ensure that they or their families benefit from social protection measures and other monetary and non-monetary reparations included in the transitional justice packages to be administered by the Bangsamoro Government.
