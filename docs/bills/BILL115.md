**AN ACT**
**DECLARING MARCH 6 OF EVERY YEAR AS BUD DAJO DAY IN COMMEMORATION OF THE TAUSUG’S RESISTANCE TO FOREIGN OCCUPATION AND THEIR CONTINUING QUEST FOR PEACE AND SELF-DETERMINATION**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

On March 6, 1906, 800 to 1,000 Tausug villagers were massacred inside the 50-foot crater of Bud Dajo – a dormant volcano six to seven kilometers away from Jolo, Sulu. The victims were a community of Tausugs who fled to Bud Dajo in defiance of the United States’ occupation of Mindanao.

Despite being out-gunned and overpowered, the freedom-loving Tausugs chose to fight, and sacrifice their lives, rather than submit to American rule by paying taxes or surrendering their weapons. Seldom in history do we find such bravery as that displayed by the Tausugs at Bud Dajo, in their adherence to defending “hulah, bangsa, iban agama (homeland, nation, and faith).”

Based on reports at the time, the American colonial government preferred to call the massacre a “battle” but many American personalities, such as social critic Samuel Clemens—who is also known by his pen name, Mark Twain—and American Historian Vic Hurley, called the encounter a massacre. American soldiers stormed the high mountain peak to kill 1,000 Muslims, an assault that also resulted in the deaths of 21 American soldiers. Whether it was a battle or massacre, this was certainly the bloodiest engagement of the Tausug resistance against foreign invaders.

Clemens wrote a scathing piece in 1906 about the Bud Dajo massacre, in which he said "'Slaughter' is a good word. Certainly, there is not a better one in the Unabridged Dictionary for this occasion."

According to Hurley's account: “After the engagement the crater was a shamble. Moros were piled five-deep in the trenches where they had been mowed down by the artillery and rifle fire. The American attack had been supported by two quick-firing guns from the gunboat Pampanga and examination of the dead showed that many of the Moros had as many as 50 wounds. Of the 1,000 Moros who opened the battle two days previously, only six men survived the carnage.”

This fight to the death for freedom resonates the main aspiration of any human: To be free, and to hold that freedom to the last breath, with all the courage one can muster to do so.

Today, the Bud Dajo massacre continues to inspire the Tausugs in their struggle for self-determination and the quest for peace. This bill seeks to rectify the government’s neglect in marking this important historical event. The government should hold commemorative activities of the massacre so that the people, especially the youth, can better appreciate the history of our struggle.
