**AN ACT**
**STRENGTHENING VOLUNTEERISM IN THE STRENGTHENING BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM), PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**Explanatory Note**

*“And whoever volunteers good [i.e. excess] – it is better for him.”*
– **(Holy Qur’an 2:184)¹**

*“And whoever volunteers good – then indeed, Allah is Appreciative and Knowing.”*
– **(Holy Qur’an 2: 158)²**

**Volunteerism in Islam**

Volunteerism is not a new concept in Islam. One of the five pillars of Islam is the giving of *zakat* and one of the forms of giving *zakat* is through volunteerism.³ It is a very broad concept that encompasses whatever one does for the benefit of others for the sake of Allah.⁴ Moreover, it is also a cornerstone of Muslim tradition to render acts of service and to be in the aid of others.⁵

According to Dr. Ahmad Hussein Sakr of the Islamic Research Foundation International (IRFI), Inc., Islam is a faith of action and as Muslims, we are encouraged to take on a broader role by working to improve the communities we live in. One of the ways in which we can take on a broader role is through volunteerism. It is a practice that we should cultivate as it is one of the lifebloods of any community. It is because of volunteers that communities are able to run organization, perform social services, feed the hungry, shelter the homeless, open libraries, run schools, set up blood banks, and et cetera. It is by translating our love of Allah into good actions, like volunteerism, that we strengthen our *imaan*.⁶

According to Kabyte Uthman Sulaiman of the International Islamic University Malaysia⁷ in his article titled “Volunteerism from the Islamic Perspective⁸”, the Arabic concept for volunteerism is called *“al-Tatawwou”*, derived from the word *“tawa’a”*, an Arabic verb which means **“performing an action willingly”**. In the same article, it was also stated that there are several terms in Arabic which have the same meaning as that of *“al-Tatawwou”*, namely, *“al-Tanafful”* or supererogation or the performance of more than what is asked for, such as the performance of additional *“ibadat”* or acts of worship, like salat, zakat, and hajj; *“al-Ihsan”* or philanthropy or technically, **“doing beautiful things”**; and *“al-Ithar”* or unselfishness or to give preference over oneself in terms of benefit or repulsion.”⁹

**Volunteerism as an international concept**

The United Nations Volunteers (UNV) promotes the power of volunteerism. Globally, volunteers are motivated by values like those of justice, equality, and freedom, as expressed in the United Nations Charter, with the end goal of improving the well-being of all of the people in the world. According to the State of the World’s Volunteerism Report 2021: Volunteering and the 21st Century Social Contract Draft concept, March 2021, “volunteerism, in its various forms, has often been positioned as a universal asset which can help shape, localize and achieve development goals.”¹⁰

It is well-noted that as United Nations, we have a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are universal goals and a set of bold commitments to the people of the planet Earth “to end poverty, fight inequality and injustice and tackle climate change by 2030”. These SDGs were adopted by world leaders at the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit in September of 2015. They call for a consistent change in attitudes and behaviors amongst people, as well as consistent contributions through concerted actions such as volunteerism. In fact, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development “explicitly recognizes volunteer groups as stakeholders to achieve the 17 SDGs” as “voluntary participation is embedded as part of the evolving “social contract”, an evolving agreement between people and states on their mutual roles and responsibilities towards the fulfilment of the SDGs.”¹¹ This is because globally, volunteers facilitate changes in mindsets by raising awareness, championing those changes and inspiring others,” as well as acting on those changes.¹² Notably today, people engage in volunteerism for a myriad of reasons, these reasons including the elimination of poverty, the improvement of basic health and education, the provision of safe water supply and adequate sanitation, tackling environmental issues and climate change, reducing and managing the risk of disasters, or combatting social exclusion and violence.¹³

Around the world, volunteerism has become a powerful tool “to expand and mobilize constituencies, and to engage people in the planning and implementation of the SDGs”. Volunteerism has been seen to create a productive relationship between states and people as it helps localize the achievement of the SDGs, through “spaces of interaction between governments and people” to create and device concrete and scalable actions.¹⁴

**Volunteerism during the COVID-19 Pandemic**

Even at the heart of the COVID-19 pandemic which shocked the world in 2020 to this day, volunteers have gone through extraordinary and exceptional lengths to provide aid and display solidarity across the world. According to United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, “volunteers have been assisting vulnerable groups, correcting misinformation, educating children, providing essential services to the elderly, and supporting front-line health workers”.¹⁵

**Volunteerism in the Philippines**

Volunteerism is also not a novel concept in the Philippines. The concept of *“bayanihan”* has flourished and lived on in every Filipino community since time immemorial. The term relates to the ancient practice of helping each other move homes and has been associated with voluntary cooperation.¹⁶ The practice of *bayanihan* has transcended and evolved to engage all sectors, namely the government, civil society organizations, academic institutions, businesses, private persons, and et cetera. The Philippine Government gives paramount importance to the proactive participation of the people as volunteers and as prime movers of development who work hand-in-hand with the duty-bearers through volunteer engagements. It is not only a practice, but is centuries-worth of pure Filipino tradition that has been embedded to its culture to promote the welfare of an entire community and every Filipino in need.¹⁷

**Volunteerism in the Bangsamoro**

In the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, volunteerism has long been practiced too, and has a significant impact in sustaining the gains of the peace process. According to Goldin Institute Global Fellow Lo Ivan Castillon, volunteerism “is the key to peace in the Bangsamoro.” He also states that there is a strong relationship between peace-building and volunteerism as it generates forms of social capital that are indispensable to peace-building and “the promotion of social cohesion, reconciliation, civic engagement, and the development of local human capacities.”¹⁸

There are many volunteers in the Bangsamoro but most of them are not always documented or recognized. We do, however, have the Bangsamoro Youth Transition Priority Agenda (BYTPA) of the Bangsamoro Youth Commission (BYC), which focus on active participation and volunteerism. However, there is a lack of any formal organization that focuses on, caters to, or assembles volunteers concerning different modes of volunteerism.

There is a need to encourage not only the youth, but also other organizations to engage in volunteerism in the Bangsamoro, given that the BARMM is a disaster-prone region, and a region which is in need of more private intervention, in cooperation with the primary government duty-bearers, to help attain the SDGs and address issues in the grassroots.

There is a need for the Bangsamoro Government to recognize, support, and promote volunteerism in order to multiply the forces of the government, in cooperation with volunteers, especially in the geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
