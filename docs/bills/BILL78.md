**AN ACT**
**CREATING THE BANGSAMORO PARLIAMENT CORPORATE BODY, ENHANCING THE PARLIAMENTARY GOVERNANCE OF THE REGION, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

With the enactment of Republic Act No. 11054 and the shift of the Bangsamoro Government to a parliamentary form of government comes a greater expectation to deliver on priorities and commitments. This has led the government to look more critically at internal governance structures and prevailing relationships with the executive.

The aim of this legislative measure is for the establishment of a parliamentary corporate body towards a move to better utilize the resources available to the Bangsamoro Government while, at the same time, enhancing the parliament’s independence from the executive.

The Bangsamoro Parliament Corporate Body will allow the Parliament to run its operations insulated from political pressures. It will allow for a clear delineation between Parliament and the Cabinet, as the separation of the executive from the legislature is fundamental. This arrangement also enhances the Parliament’s authority, by allowing support from across party affiliations. Thus, providing consistency and sustainability for independent decision-making.

As a shift from a Presidential system, having an independent Parliament Corporate Body equips the Parliament with the ability to objectively review and scrutinize the work of the Government, its annual budget, and legislation representative of its constituents.

In cases around the globe where such bodies have been established, it is proven and there is concrete evidence to support that parliament is better able to assert its independence and ensure that adequate resources, both financial and otherwise, are made available.

This, in turn, enables the parliament to discharge its functions more effectively while also allowing its Members to exercise appropriate control over the prioritization of the delivery of services by the parliamentary service.

Given that one of the key purposes of parliament is to hold the executive to account, there is a compelling reason that parliament should be able to discharge its legal mandates and responsibilities free from partisan and political interference.

The drive for parliamentary independence is seen as a necessary prerequisite to good parliamentary governance. Furthermore, operational autonomy should act in the fulfilment of the parliament’s mandate.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
