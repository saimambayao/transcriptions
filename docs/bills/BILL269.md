**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The 1987 Constitution of the Philippine provides that “the State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them”. It emphasizes the responsibility of the government to ensure the well-being of its citizens and raise awareness among the population about health-related issues.

Likewise, Section 22 of RA 11054 or also known as Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. It shall also uphold the people’s right to have access to essential goods, health, and other social services that promote their well-being. In relation to this policy, the Bangsamoro government is committed to creating an environment where everyone has access to health care services, facilities, and resources in order to improve heath. This includes the availability, accessibility, and affordability of healthcare services to prevent and control diseases and address social determinants of health.

Bongo Island is comprised of eight (8) barangays under the jurisdiction of Municipality of Parang, Maguindanao del Norte. Its population, as determined by the 2020 Census, was 4,000. This represented 3.89% of the total population of Parang. Bongo Island is 19.9 kilometers away from Barangay Poblacion, Parang, where some patients are being transferred in some cases. However, in extreme cases, patients need to be transferred immediately in Cotabato City which is twenty four (24) kilometers away.

In both cases, residents have to cross the sea in order to avail appropriate medical services. Transporting patients using boats is subject to weather conditions. It poses a risk to the safety of the patient during transit. When strong water current is experienced, there is no way that the patient can be transported to the nearest hospital. Moreover, boat transportation may involve additional costs, such as fuel, fees, and maintenance.

In 2013, Bongo Island suffered from a cholera outbreak where two (2) residents, an elderly woman and a 3-year old child, have died and sixty four (64) residents were infected. The same incident repeated in 2020 where two (2) children died due to diarrhea, and 42 more individuals were suspected of being hit by cholera in Bongo Island. This means that the absence of the hospital has added to the health predicaments of the residents. Hence, the purpose of the creating an infirmary hospital in Bongo Island is to address the health care needs of residents in the community. In effect, the establishment of an infirmary hospital in Bongo Island, Parang would result in reduced morbidity, lower mortality, and increase savings in terms of medical expenses.
