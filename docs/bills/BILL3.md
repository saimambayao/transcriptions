**AN ACT MANDATING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF COMFORT ROOMS WITH EFFICIENT WATER AND CLEANLINESS SYSTEMS IN EVERY SCHOOL, DEFINING ITS SCOPE AND COVERAGE, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREOF, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**Explanatory Note**

Article II, Section 13 of the 1987 Constitution provides that "[t]he State recognizes the vital role of the youth in nation-building and shall promote and protect their physical, moral spiritual, intellectual and social well-being."

This is also reiterated in Section 13, Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), which states that the "Bangsamoro Government shall recognize the vital role of the youth in nation-building, promote and protect their physical, moral, spiritual, and nationalism, encourage involvement in public and civic affairs, and promote mental and physical fitness through sports."

Toilets are very important health facilities in every school. Based on Water, Sanitation and Hygiene in School (WinS) monitoring data for SY 2018-2019, about 72.9% of all schools have at least one (1) functional toilet, while 55.5% are within the ratio of one (1) toilet bowl for every 50 students. The 2019 National School Building Inventory shows that for each specified use of toilet according to gender, the ratio of toilet bowl to student is 1:85 for female and 1:105 for male, which is still beyond the acceptable standard of 1:50 for female and 1:100 for male.¹

In a 2016 news report by Inquirer, it stated that while the Philippines had a "relatively good" national toilet-to-pupil ratio of 1:39 (one toilet is to 39 students), some areas are being missed. For example, the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao had a ratio of one toilet to more than 100 people.²

Section 22, Article IX of the BOL provides that "[t]he Bangsamoro Government shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. It shall also uphold the peoples' right to have access to essential goods health, and other social services that promote their well-being."

Comfort rooms are very important spaces in schools. They are important in the everyday lives of the students. The lack of access to proper and clean toilets in schools poses a huge barrier to education. The lack of toilets can impact the student's ability to learn and can threaten their education due to poor health which will subsequently lead to absenteeism and reduced concentration. Investing in good comfort rooms can help maintain their dignity.

In particular, the schools have crucial role in imparting to students the importance of sanitation and health care. Since the academic performance of students mainly depend on their health conditions.

In furtherance of the Government's primordial duty as *parens patriae* or the guardian of the rights of the people, it is necessary to prioritize the needs of the students. This includes provision of a safe and healthy environment for learning and to normalize the toilet to pupil ratio by establishing comfort rooms in every school.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
