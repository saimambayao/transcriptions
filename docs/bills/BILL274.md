**Explanatory Note**

Quality education, as an alienable right of all Filipinos, shall be upheld at all times to provide learners equal opportunity for a proper and inclusive learning experience to ensure students' holistic development. Through this, students are prepared, equipped, and will become capable human resources whose talents and skill sets are beneficial to their respective chosen careers.

Under the 1987 Philippine Constitution Article XIV, Section 1, the State shall protect and promote the right of all citizens to quality education at all levels, and shall take appropriate steps to make such education accessible to all.

Moreover, Section 19, Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law on Tribal University System provides that:
> “The Parliament shall create a tribal university system in the Bangsamoro Government to address the higher educational needs of the non-Moro indigenous peoples.
>
> The Parliament shall pass a law to recognize and support the indigenous peoples’ educational system for its integration in the Bangsamoro educational system.”

Furthermore, Section 145, Chapter 5 of Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 18, or the Bangsamoro Education Code on Tribal University System provides that:

> “The Tribal University System shall provide better higher education for Indigenous Peoples’ students to be functional citizen of the community. Additionally, it shall provide school system where the Indigenous Peoples’ language, culture, and traditional knowledge of the Elders are incorporated in the curriculum and extracurricular activities of the students.
>
> Under the Tribal University System, a Tribal University shall be created which shall be founded upon Indigenous Knowledge Systems and Practices (IKSP). It shall develop educational programs appropriate and relevant to the needs and aspirations of the IPs, and geared toward respect, promotion, protection, and preservation of their cultures and practices. The University shall have the programs in arts and sciences to support these aspirations. It shall endeavor to inspire young IPs to serve and become leaders in their ancestral domains and indigenous communities. It shall involve training teachers to carry out effectively the mandates of the Tribal University.”

Recognizing the importance of education in developing life, skills, this bill seeks the conversion of the Upi Agricultural School (UAS) to Bangsamoro Tribal University to provide a better and more accessible higher education to indigenous peoples learners. This development enables the institution to function as instruction facility, research extension, and tertiary and secondary school. It also envisions to offer advanced studies and to become the leader in various fields including that of short-term vocational-technical and other continuing courses in the area.

This bill further seeks to require the promulgation and implementation of policies that will better the delivery of quality and accessible higher education in this institution of higher learning. This includes the administration and exercise of all powers under the existing laws, policies on school fees and socialized tuition scheme, maintenance of the entire academic building, and advancement of academic curricula and other programs, among others.

The elevation of the school to a regular campus will give them autonomous decision-making prerogatives. At the same time, the devolution of their powers would be advantageous for their future as it would invite local stakeholders to engage more and be involved in affairs that are an integral part of their educational system.

What is being sought goes beyond a change of name but a qualitative improvement in its offerings and outcomes. The conversion of UAS to a tribal university is driven not only by egalitarian motives of democratizing access to its portals but in making sure that it is attended with excellence.

The conversion of the school is an essential part of the growth of the locality. As the municipality grows, so must the school grow so it can train and require human capital to propel its progress. Education is a development imperative. This bill ensures that it is for the present and for the future of this area and those who dwell therein.

With the immediate enactment of this bill, it is hoped that all inhibitions and challenges that take a toll on the proper and efficient delivery of quality education will surely be addressed and will likewise improve the standard of learning experience.

In view thereof, the swift approval of this bill is urgently sought.
