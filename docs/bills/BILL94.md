**AN ACT PROMOTING THE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THE BANGSAMORO MINORS, PROVIDING FOR THE GENERAL GUIDELINES IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A CURFEW FOR MINORS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM)**

**Explanatory Note**

*“We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.”* – Franklin D. Roosevelt

*“The youth is the hope of our future.”* – Jose P. Rizal

**The State’s premium on the youth**

The protection of the youth is essential for the preservation and existence of our country. No less than the 1987 Philippine Constitution, under its declaration of state policies, recognizes the vital role of the youth in nation-building. It places a premium on the promotion and protection of the youth’s physical, moral, spiritual, intellectual, and social well-being.

The same protection is reiterated in our R.A. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL). The rights of children include the respect, protection, and promotion of their rights as children, especially orphans of tender age. They shall be protected from exploitation, abuse or discrimination… Bangsamoro policies and programs shall also take into utmost consideration the best interest of children, and promote and protect the rights of children, youth, and adolescents, including their survival and development.

**On violence against children**

According to the United Nations’ Children’s Fund (UNICEF) National Baseline Study on Violence against Children, it is an unfortunate fact that children are exposed to various forms of violence, including physical, emotional and sexual exploitation and abuse, as well as neglect, all while being the most vulnerable sector when it comes to dealing with said violence.

In the Philippines, as a result of violence, thousands of children are robbed of their childhood, resulting in lifelong developmental challenges. The effects include both mental and physical health disorders, such as anxiety, depression, and cardiovascular diseases, as well as health-risk behaviors, such as smoking, alcoholism, drug abuse, and engagement in high risk sexual activity.

Clearly, the physical and emotional harm to children resulting from the experience of and exposure to violence is devastating. The impacts are lasting emotional and psychological effects, as well as what could possibly be a lifetime of physical pain and emotional suffering. As a result of these horrid experiences, juvenile victims may become perpetrators of violence too.

When child victims are at an increased risk of becoming children in conflict with the law, there are increased costs to the criminal justice system. To add, society loses when children exposed to violence are less able, if not able, to contribute and become productive members of their community.

**On crimes that happen during the night time**

“*Criminals find their best opportunities in the dark.*” This was the conclusion of a study that examined more than 840,000 police incidents from across 10 major cities in the United States, titled “*Crimes at Night: Analyzing Incident Reports in Major Cities*”. In the study, although it was found that half of police incidents occurred during the day, the more violent crimes of murder, rape or sexual assault, and robbery were more frequently report during the night time.

**On crimes that happen during the night time that involve children**

Violence against minors can occur in different circumstances, such as juvenile-related crime, victimization, and delinquency. For instance, during a night patrol in a village in Metro Manila, a village council chairman and his team busted a sex den where minors were loitering. The sex den’s operators were minors aged 10 to 13 years old, who carried knives and sharp tools as weapons. Apart from this, gang riots, looting, and robberies were frequent.

**On a general curfew as a means to protect minors**

In a stringent effort to curb or deter juvenile violence, crime, victimization, and delinquency, curfews have reemerged as an option for policymakers. According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention of the United States Government, citing the Ruefle and Reynolds analysis in their research article titled “*Curfews and Delinquency in Major American Cities*”, those who support curfews for minors indicate that neighborhoods afflicted with high rates of crime may use curfews as a “means to protect nondelinquent youth from crime and to deny delinquent youth the opportunity to engage in criminal behavior.”

Moreover, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI’s) 1994 Uniform Crime Report (UCR), by keeping youth under the age of 18 off the street, curfews are expected to reduce the incidence of crime and the rates of youth victimization, mainly because juvenile perpetrators of crime often take other youth as their victims.

In the interest of public order and safety, it is imperative to regulate the movement of minor children, especially during night time, in order to protect them from violence, exploitation, abuse, cruelty, neglect, and other harmful conditions prejudicial and detrimental to their well-being and development.

Even the national government of the Philippines, through its legislative body, is considering the imposition of a national curfew to lessen the exposure of children to crime and violence. In 2017, the House of Representatives, in an unnumbered bill with the title “*Safe Hours for Children Act,*” aims to ensure the “safety and self-esteem” of children, prevent criminals from using them in illegal activities, and protect them from abuse and exploitation, by setting a nationwide curfew for minors. However, the bill is still subject to debates and amendments at the House plenary.

Moreover, given the vulnerability of minors, and given the issue of the Philippine Government wanting to lower the age of responsibility, perhaps it would be better, as an act of prevention, to limit the exposure of minors to crimes and syndicates, by imposing a general curfew.

**Legal bases of curfews for minors**

It is the declared policy of the state that it recognizes the sanctity of family life and shall protect and strengthen the family as a basic autonomous social institution. It shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from conception. **The natural and primary right and duty of parents in the rearing of the youth for civic efficiency and the development of moral character shall receive the support of the Government.**

It is also stated in the Constitution that the State shall defend the right of children to assistance, including proper care and nutrition, and **special protection from all forms of neglect, abuse, cruelty, exploitation, and other conditions prejudicial to their development.**

Moreover, in the case of *Samahan ng mga Progresibong Kabataan (SPARK) v. City of Quezon, City of Manila, and City of Navotas*, the Supreme Court ruled that the State, as *parens patriae*, has the inherent right and duty to aid parents in the moral development of their children, and, thus, assumes a supporting role for parents to fulfill their parental obligations.

The Supreme Court also ruled in the said case that curfew ordinances “are but examples of legal restrictions designed to aid parents in their role of promoting their children’s well-being… Minors, because of their peculiar vulnerability and lack of experience, are not only more exposed to potential physical harm by criminal elements that operate during the night; their moral well-being is likewise imperiled as minor children are prone to making detrimental decisions during this time.”

It also ruled that “curfew ordinances positively influence children to spend more time at home. Consequently, this situation provides parents with better opportunities to take a more active role in their children’s upbringing.”

It cited *Schleifer v. City of Charlottesvillle* where the US court observed that:

> “A curfew aids the efforts of parents who desire to protect their children from the perils of the street but are unable to control the nocturnal behavior of those children.” Curfews may also aid the “efforts of parents who prefer their children to spend time on their studies than on the streets.”

The Supreme Court went on to say that “the stated purposes of the curfew ordinances, specifically the promotion of juvenile safety and prevention of juvenile crime, inarguably serve the interest of public safety. The restriction on the minor’s movement and activities within the confines of their residences and their immediate vicinity during the curfew period is perceived to reduce the probability of the minor becoming victims of or getting involved in crimes and criminal activities.”

As stated by the Court, our legal system is replete with laws emphasizing the State's duty to afford special protection to children, i.e., R.A. 7610, R.A. 9775, R.A. 9262, R.A. 9851, R.A. 9344, R.A. 10364, R.A. 9211, R.A. 8980, R.A. 9288, and P.D. 603 as amended.

Particularly relevant is Article 139 of P.D. 603, which explicitly authorizes local government units, through their city or municipal councils, to set curfew hours for children. It reads:

> **Article 139. Curfew Hours for Children.** – City or municipal councils may prescribe such curfew hours for children as may be warranted by local conditions. The duty to enforce curfew ordinances shall devolve upon the parents or guardians and the local authorities.
> 
> Any parent or guardian found grossly negligent in the performance of the duty imposed by this article shall be admonished by the Department of Social Welfare or the Council for the Protection of Children.

**Conclusion**

The 1987 Philippine Constitution, the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), ratified by the Philippines, and several domestic laws recognize the special status of minors. It is because of the minor’s vulnerability and their ability to mature and develop that justify their special protection under the law. Thus, in order to deter and prevent minors from being involved in or exposed to violence, crime, victimization, and delinquency, the passage of this legislative measure is earnestly sought.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
