**UPGRADING DATU HALUN SAKILAN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL INTO A LEVEL II HOSPITAL, INCREASING ITS BED CAPACITY, UPGRADING ITS PROFESSIONAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND FACILITIES, AUTHORIZING THE INCREASE OF ITS MEDICAL PERSONNEL, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Province of Tawi-Tawi comprises eleven island municipalities, all encompassed by two legislative districts and further subdivided into 203 barangays. Hence, the Datu Halun Sakilan Memorial Hospital was established to ensure the accessible delivery of an integrated, quality, and sustainable health service to all its residents in the province.

Since its creation in 1974, it remains to be a Level 1 hospital with a limited budget for operations and severely deficient health manpower status. Positions for nurses, doctors, and other vital positions are significantly below the WHO standards for human resources for health.

In 1982, Batas Pambansa Blg. 257 converted the Datu Halun Sakilan Memorial Hospital to a provincial hospital with a seventy-five (75) bed capacity.

Despite its conversion, it is still difficult for the hospital to attend to all of the residents due to an inadequate amount of medical equipment, medicine, and healthcare staff. First, the only way for most of the populace to visit the hospital is by riding a boat, since the municipalities are scattered on islands. To travel to the nearest Level II medical facility in Zamboanga City, it takes the average Tawi-Tawi resident 16 hours to travel by boat, and taking a flight remains a non-economical alternative.

To further highlight the urgency, the Level I 75-bed capacity hospital presently has a 150-200% bed occupancy rate. This overloaded capacity, coupled with the insufficient budget which amount is shared concomitantly by 11 Rural Health Units in the province, makes it more difficult for field health workers to implement the health programs and deliver basic health services in remote areas.

On behalf of our constituents from the island provinces, the doctors and allied health professionals of Datu Halun Sakilan Memorial Hospital, and as a native of the Province of Tawi-Tawi, this representation is sponsoring this bill with urgency and without reservation, in fulfillment of our obligations under the Bangsamoro Organic Law to adopt a policy on health that provides for a comprehensive and integrated health service delivery for our constituents.

In view of the foregoing, approval of this bill is earnestly sought.
