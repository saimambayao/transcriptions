**AN ACT**
**DECLARING MARCH 18 OF EVERY YEAR AS A SPECIAL NON-WORKING PUBLIC HOLIDAY IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION TO BE KNOWN AS THE “JABIDAH COMMEMORATION DAY”**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

March 18 is a day that evokes memories both intensely emotional as well as political for many Muslims in the country. Considered by many as the founding moment of Muslim separatism in Mindanao, the Jabidah massacre, which took place on Corregidor Island, marks a crucial moment in the history of the country which triggered the rise of the Bangsamoro armed struggle towards the continuous assertion of their rights and aspirations.

On that day in 1968, over a hundred young men, mostly Muslims, had been recruited by the military into a special guerilla training aimed at reclaiming Sabah, which had become part of Malaysia in 1963, but a year earlier had been ceded by the Sultan of Sulu to the Philippines.

Things came to a head when the recruits’ allowances were withheld and when the supply of basic provisions in the training camp ran short. The soldiers protested and mutinied, and their superiors reacted violently. On the night when the men were supposed to be sent back home, shots were heard that left a dozen or so Muslim soldiers dead.

Although the Jabidah Massacre was not the first or last of such acts of violence, and the number of Muslim casualties was comparatively small, it stands out in collective memory as an exemplar of the repression of Muslims.

Why the Jabidah massacre was persistently deemed by many as arguably more significant for the development of the autonomy of the Bangsamoro region than any other political killings that preceded and followed it such as the killings in Bud Daho (1906) and Bud Bagsak (1911, 1913), the Kamlon rebellion(1950s), and the killings at Manili (1971), Tacub (1971), Malisbong (1974), Patikul (1977) and Pata (1981) may be partly explained by the political ferment in the Philippines and the world over in the late 1960s which provided the conditions for the rise of young secular Moro radicals who objected to the collaboration between traditional elites in Mindanao and elites in Manila, often at the expense of the interests of common people.

However, crucial events in our history such as the Jabidah massacre, are often questioned and forgotten, and no concrete steps have been made towards any proper way by which such events should be remembered. In fact, in the months following the tragic incident, the military and the Marcos regime launched a concerted effort to deny the massacre, and when this proved untenable, they sought to explain it in ways favorable to their interests.

The Bangsamoro people’s memories themselves should always constitute a crucial intervention in this contestation. The response to the increasing clamor to solve the Mindanao problem helped in constituting a much more central role for the Jabidah massacre in the narrative on the origins of the Mindanao conflict. The Jabidah massacre has evolved into a broader metaphor for a range of the state’s sins of omission and commission against Muslims and Mindanao.

As representatives of the Bangsamoro people, we have the responsibility to dissect history in search for the common truths, and from there, to lay down the direction that our region will take to attain sustainable peace and progress.

Though we cannot undo the wrongdoing of the past, we have, however, a responsibility to raise awareness and constantly remind the future generations on the history of the Bangsamoro Autonomy, which will hopefully inspire a culture of nonviolence between and among the people, and inculcate a deep respect for the history of the Bangsamoro armed struggle, human rights, and the dignity of human life.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
