**WHEREAS**, on March 27, 2014, the Government of the Philippines (GPH) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) signed the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB), which includes, among others, the Annex on Normalization that mandates the establishment of the Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC) to investigate and document the legitimate grievances, historical injustices, human rights abuses, and marginalization faced by the Bangsamoro and Indigenous Peoples, to make recommendations aimed at resolving these issues, and to devise a mechanism for their implementation;

**WHEREAS**, the TJRC presented its report on March 15, 2016, in Cotabato City and on March 16, 2016, in Manila, containing a list of recommendations directed towards a national healing process from the decades-long armed conflict in Mindanao and addressing deep-rooted prejudices between our peoples;
