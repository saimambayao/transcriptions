**RESOLUTION EXPRESSING PROFOUND GRATITUDE AND APPRECIATION OF THE BANGSAMORO TRANSITION AUTHORITY TO PRESIDENT RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE FOR THE PASSAGE OF THE BANGSAMORO ORGANIC LAW, BTA EXTENSION, AND THE OVERWHELMING SUPPORT OF HIS ADMINISTRATION TO THE BANGSAMORO PEOPLE**

**WHEREAS**, Section 1, Article X of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides that there shall be autonomous regions in Muslim Mindanao and the Cordilleras;

**WHEREAS**, Republic Act (RA) No. 11054 also known as the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) was signed into law by President Rodrigo Roa Duterte on July 26, 2018, and became effective on August 10, 2018, creating the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) as the Interim Government in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region during the transition period;

**WHEREAS**, during the inauguration of the BARMM, President Duterte affirmed, "*Our victory in this plebiscite is proof of our determination to bring about genuine peace and development in Muslim Mindanao through a responsive government that truly reflects the identity of its people*";

**WHEREAS**, President Duterte enunciated in his speech on the 2nd Anniversary of BARMM, "*As I have promised during the early part of my term, we have laid the groundwork for lasting peace and progress in Mindanao. Two years ago, we have reached this milestone — the realization of our commitment to foster enduring peace and stability in the Bangsamoro*";

**WHEREAS**, Section 12, Article XVI of RA No. 11054 provides that immediately upon the election and qualification of the Chief Minister under the first Parliament, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority shall be deemed dissolved. Sec. 13 further states that the first regular election for the Bangsamoro Government under this Organic Law shall be held and synchronized with the 2022 national elections;

**WHEREAS**, on October 28, 2021, President Duterte officially signed RA No. 11593 extending the transition period of the BARMM from 2022 to 2025, thereby postponing the first regional parliamentary elections in the region;

**WHEREAS**, the extension gave the BTA the much-needed time to fully realize its mandate and vision of laying down the foundation, framework and structure for the regular government under the principles of moral governance as envisioned by the Bangsamoro’s struggle for self-determination;

**WHEREAS**, President Duterte has been consistent even before his presidency on his support for the Bangsamoro’s cause and struggle and it was even made more manifest during his incumbency which culminated in the creation of the BARMM;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro people are genuinely grateful to President Duterte for recognizing the historical injustices and oppression committed by the colonizers against the Bangsamoro people;

**WHEREAS**, the passage of the Bangsamoro Organic Law serves as the greatest legacy of President Duterte to the Bangsamoro people that will have a tremendous and lasting impact on their lives for generations to come;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro people hold the president with the highest esteem and consider him as one of their own in the continuing struggle for their right to self-determination and lasting peace and prosperity for the Bangsamoro people:

**NOW, THEREFORE**, be it

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, To express its profound gratitude and appreciation to President Rodrigo Roa Duterte for the passage of the Bangsamoro Organic Law, BTA Extension, and the overwhelming support of his administration to the Bangsamoro people.
