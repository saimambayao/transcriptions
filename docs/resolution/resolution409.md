**RESOLUTION NO. 409**

**RESOLUTION REQUESTING THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH TO ESTABLISH A FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION REGIONAL FIELD OFFICE IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO**

**WHEREAS**, Section 15, Article II of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides that *“the State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people;”*

**WHEREAS**, Section 12, Article XIII of the same Constitution states that *“the State shall establish and maintain an effective food and drug regulatory system and undertake appropriate health manpower development and research, responsive to the country’s health needs and problems;”*

**WHEREAS**, Section 3, Article V of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) states that *“within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, promote health and safety, xxx of its inhabitants;”*

**WHEREAS**, Republic Act No. 9711, otherwise known as *“The Food and Drug Administration Act of 2009”*, is mandated to ensure the safety, efficacy, or quality of health products, which include food, drugs, cosmetics, devices, biological, vaccines, in-vitro diagnostic reagents, radiation-emitting devices or equipment, and household/urban hazardous substances, including pesticides and toys, or consumer products that may have an effect on health which require regulations as determined by the FDA;

**WHEREAS**, Section 36 of the immediately aforesaid Act provides that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) shall establish field offices in all regions of the country to effectively implement its regulatory functions. The current regional food and drug regulatory officers (FDRO) and regional health physicists in every regional office of the Department of Health (DOH) shall now be put under the FDA’s sole control and supervision;

**WHEREAS**, as a regulatory agency under the DOH, the FDA’s mission is to guarantee the safety, quality, purity, and efficacy of health products to protect and promote the right to health of the general public. Its core functions include licensing of establishments, registration of health products, and post-marketing surveillance of regulated entities;

**WHEREAS**, the main functions of FDA Regional Field Offices are to monitor, evaluate, and ensure compliance of manufacturers, distributors, advertisers, and retailers of processed foods, drugs, and other related products to health rules and regulations and standards of quality. The field offices shall be comprised of the following: (a) licensing, inspection, and compliance division, which shall have charge of the inspection of food, drugs, and cosmetic establishments engaged in their manufacture, importation, distribution, and sale; (b) satellite laboratory division; and (c) administrative division;”

**WHEREAS**, up to this date, there is no existing regional field office set up within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). A regional field office will strengthen compliance with the FDA by the establishments. The nearest neighboring regions where Regional Field Offices exist are Koronadal City and FDA Zamboanga;

**WHEREAS**, the Ministry of Health of BARMM is currently meeting with the FDA’s central office to establish a Memorandum of Agreement and explore the possibility of having an FDA in BARMM;

**WHEREAS**, establishing an FDA Regional Field Office within BARMM will enable the FDA to carry out its mandate and responsibility efficiently and effectively implement its regulatory functions within BARMM:

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, To request the Department of Health to establish a Food and Drug Administration Regional Field Office in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region Muslim Mindanao;

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, To forward a copy of this Resolution to the Department of Health, for information.
