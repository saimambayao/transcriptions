**RESOLUTION REQUESTING THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO TO DEVISE A MECHANISM THAT WILL PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYONE TO TAKE THE CIVIL SERVICE EXAMINATION**

**WHEREAS**, Section 9, Article II of the 1987 Constitution provides that “*the State shall promote a just and dynamic social order that will ensure the prosperity and independence of the nation and free the people from poverty through policies that provide adequate social services, promote full employment, a rising standard of living, and an improved quality of life for all;*”

**WHEREAS**, Section 3, Article IX (B) of the same constitution, provides that the Civil Service Commission (CSC), as the central personnel agency of the government, shall establish a career service and adopt measures to promote morale, efficiency, integrity, responsiveness, progressiveness, and courtesy in the civil service. It shall strengthen the merit and reward system, integrate all human resource development programs across all levels and ranks, and institutionalize a management climate conducive to public accountability;

**WHEREAS**, consistent with this, Section 7, Chapter 2, Subtitle A, Title I, Book V of Executive Order No. 292, or the “Administrative Code of 1987”, provides that the Career Service shall be characterized by, among other things, “*entrance based on merit and fitness to be determined as far as practicable by competitive examination;*”

**WHEREAS**, under Section 12 (7), Chapter 3, Subtitle A, Title I, Book V of the abovementioned code, the CSC, as the central personnel agency of the government, is mandated to “*control, supervise, and coordinate Civil Service Examinations*” and “*prescribe all forms of Civil Service examinations, appointments, report, and such other forms as may be required by law, rules and regulations;*”

**WHEREAS**, this Resolution, with due respect to and recognizing the authority of the CSC as an independent Constitutional body, acknowledges that under Section 2, Article V of R.A. 11054, or the “Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao”, it is provided that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise its authority over several matters, including, among others, the administration of the civil service, without prejudice to the overall supervision of the President of the Republic of the Philippines;

**WHEREAS**, Section 39, Article VII of the abovementioned Republic Act states that:

> “The Civil Service Commission shall establish a regional Civil Service field office and other field offices as may be needed in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region for the efficient performance of its powers and duties.
> 
> The Bangsamoro Government shall enact a civil service law: Provided, That it shall be in accordance with existing national laws. In case of conflict with the national laws, the Constitution and existing national civil service laws, rules, and regulations shall prevail.
> 
> This law shall govern the conduct of civil servants, the qualifications for nonelective positions, adopt the merit and fitness system, and protect civil service eligible in various government positions, including government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. The Bangsamoro Government shall have disciplinary authority over its own officials and employees;”

**WHEREAS**, the Civil Service Exam (CSE), also known as the Career Service Examination, is conducted twice a year by the CSC to produce eligibles to permanent government career positions;

**WHEREAS**, to take the exam, one must personally file the CSE application at the CSC Regional Office (CSCRO) or at any of the CSCRO’s field offices where one intends to take the examination;

**WHEREAS**, the acceptance of applications is on a first-come, first-served basis and shall close at any time once the CSCRO field offices have reached their target number of examinees;

**WHEREAS**, due to the pandemic and the need to comply with minimum health standards, the number of applicants has been reduced because of the lowered capacity in testing center rooms, which has made registration difficult for many people in the Bangsamoro Region, where testing centers are already limited and have become even more so because of the pandemic;

**WHEREAS**, the COVID-19 pandemic created a huge gap in the number of accommodated examinees across the entire country;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is a newly established autonomous region with a parliamentary setup that requires new, eligible civil servants;

**WHEREAS**, during the Committee on Rules meeting held on April 8, 2024, the committee learned that there were fewer slots assigned to the Bangsamoro region compared to other administrative regions in the country;

**WHEREAS**, the CSC-BARMM is categorized as a `small organization,` despite being a regional office of the CSC in the BARMM, and thus has limited capacity to undertake CSE and other functions;

**WHEREAS**, the BARMM has a serious concern regarding CSC examination because of the following:

(a) the significant gap created by the COVID-19 pandemic;
(b) the Bangsamoro region is a newly established autonomous government that needs thousands of eligible civil servants;
(c) limited number of examination slots assigned for Bangsamoro region; and
(d) the CSC-BARMM’s capacity to serve the region being an autonomous government, given its current organizational setup;

**WHEREAS**, one possible mechanism is to designate more testing centers to accommodate additional examinees;

**WHEREAS**, the CSC should devise a mechanism that will prioritize the applicants who reside in the provinces or cities being catered to by its field offices;

**WHEREAS**, there is a need for the CSC to reconsider its organizational structure in the BARMM, considering the unique setup and requirements of the autonomous government;

**WHEREAS**, there is a need to allocate additional examination slots for the BARMM that are at par with those of the other administrative regions;

**WHEREAS**, there is a significant number of people, either working in the BARMM government and seeking permanent employment or aspiring to work in the government, who are unable to do so due to a lack of eligibility, creating a need for the CSC to devise a mechanism to accommodate more examinees and provide greater opportunities for individuals to obtain career or government-service eligibility:

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, To request the Civil Service Commission Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to devise a mechanism that will provide an opportunity for everyone to take the Civil Service Examination.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, To forward a copy of this Resolution to the CSC-BARMM, for information.

**ADOPTED**, Safar 24, 1446/August 28, 2024.
