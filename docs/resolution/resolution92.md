**RESOLUTION NO. 92**

**RESOLUTION EXPRESSING THE PROFOUND CONDOLENCES OF THE BANGSAMORO TRANSITION AUTHORITY TO THE FAMILY OF MORO NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (MNLF) CHAIRPERSON YUSOP H. JIKIRI, FORMER SULU GOVERNOR (2001-2004), FORMER SULU REPRESENTATIVE (2007-2010), AND A PILLAR OF THE BANGSAMORO PEACE PROCESS, HONORING HIS LEGACY IN PUBLIC SERVICE TO THE BANGSAMORO NATION**

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region lost one of its staunchest supporters for the Bangsamoro peace process — Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) Chairman Yusop H. Jikiri, who passed away on October 17, 2020 due to lingering bone cancer;

**WHEREAS**, born in Pasil, Indanan, Sulu from humble beginnings, the late Chairman Jikiri rose as one of MNLF’s top commanders, eventually rising to become the group’s leader. His contemporaries in the revolution remember him well as a fierce warrior, a reputation that earned him the title *Gagandilan* among his peers. He assumed chairmanship of the MNLF Council of Leaders in 2017;

**WHEREAS**, Jikiri was the group’s Chief of Staff when the 1996 Final Peace Agreement was signed between the national government and the MNLF. He served as Sulu Governor from 2001-2004, its First District Representative from 2007-2010, and also was the chairman of the Southern Philippines Development Authority (SPDA);

**WHEREAS**, his pronouncement in his inaugural speech as elected Sulu governor in 2001 still resonates with this generation:

“My government is your government, for truly I belong to you, I am among you, a son of a poor family. To this land I give my life, body and soul. Let me, therefore, seek your cooperation. Come to me as your elder brother, (or) even as your father and together we can make this land great once more in history”;

**WHEREAS**, his leadership in the MNLF led to the founding of the MNLF Anti-Kidnapping and Terrorism Task Force responding to the urgent call of preserving peace and order in the islands of Sulu;

**WHEREAS**, in 2015, Jikiri led the MNLF in the tripartite meeting organized by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which called on the Philippine Government and the MNLF to review and preserve the gains of the 1996 Final Peace Agreement;

**WHEREAS**, Jikiri acknowledged that the Bangsamoro Organic Law is a convergence of all peace agreements between the Philippine Government and the Moro fronts. His leadership brought about a strong partnership between the MNLF and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF);

**WHEREAS**, the MNLF, represented by Jikiri, signed an agreement with MILF Chairman Murad Ebrahim in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia resulting in the cooperation of MNLF and MILF that was reflected in the BOL;

**WHEREAS**, a pillar of the Bangsamoro peace process, who dedicated his life’s work for *hula, bangsa, agama*, Jikiri was one of the influential supporters for the enactment and ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law that paved the way for the Bangsamoro people and the other inhabitants in the autonomous region to establish enduring peace by allowing genuine and meaningful self-governance;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Parliament condoles with the bereaved family and loved ones of the late Chairman Yusop H. Jikiri, as well as expresses its deep gratitude for his contributions in public service and as *mujahideen* for the Bangsamoro region and for the nation;

**WHEREAS**, a man of faith, leadership and courage, Jikiri has shown exemplary traits worthy of emulation and remembrance which will forever remain part of the narrative of the Bangsamoro struggle for meaningful self-governance;

**WHEREAS**, the passing away of a great public servant is a great loss to the nation and to the Bangsamoro community. May his good deeds be rewarded by Allah, and his sins forgiven. May Allah grant him *Jannatul Firdaus*;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to express its profound condolences to the family of Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) Chairman Yusop H. Jikiri, Former Sulu Governor (2001-2004), Former Sulu Representative (2007-2010), and a pillar of the Bangsamoro peace process.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, to honor his legacy in public service to the Bangsamoro nation.

**RESOLVED, FINALLY**, to forward this resolution to the bereaved family of late Chairman Yusop H. Jikiri, for information.

**ADOPTED**, November 17, 2020.
