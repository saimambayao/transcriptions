**FIRST REGULAR SESSION**

**RESOLUTION NO. 56**

**RESOLUTION CALLING FOR THE CREATION OF THE NATIONAL TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION FOR THE BANGSAMORO AND THE FORMULATION AND NATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION OF A TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION PROGRAM FOR THE BANGSAMORO**

**WHEREAS**, the creation of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) and the concomitant establishment of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) are among the political commitments embodied in the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB), the peace pact between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF);

**WHEREAS**, another important component of the CAB is transitional justice and reconciliation, which is meant to address the legitimate grievances of the Bangsamoro people, correct historical injustice, and address human rights violations and marginalization through land dispossession with a view to healing the wounds of conflict, as cited in the Annex on Normalization;

**WHEREAS**, pursuant to the CAB, the Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC) was created to undertake an initial study and outline preliminary recommendations for the appropriate mechanisms for transitional justice and reconciliation;

**WHEREAS**, the TJRC recommended the establishment of a National Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Commission on the Bangsamoro (NTJRCB) as the dedicated national government agency tasked to oversee and support all the operations on transitional justice and reconciliation throughout the country, recognizing that achieving healing and reconciliation cannot be concentrated in one region alone and should involve the entire Filipino society;

**WHEREAS**, a Bill was filed in the previous Congress in the House of Representatives for the creation of the NTJRCB, but has unfortunately not passed beyond Committee deliberations;

**WHEREAS**, Republic Act No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) provides for the mandate of the Bangsamoro Parliament to enact a transitional justice mechanism;

**WHEREAS**, the exercise of this legal mandate can only encompass the territorial jurisdiction and governmental authorities of the Bangsamoro Government, and is not a sufficient substitute for the creation of an NTJRCB;

**WHEREAS**, Executive Order No. 79 s. 2019 provided for the creation of the Inter-Cabinet Cluster Mechanism on Normalization (ICCMN) which is tasked to, among others, lead the implementation of the Annex on Normalization, which includes the recommendations of the TJRC, and to convene the relevant agencies to adopt and implement a Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Program for the BARMM;

**WHEREAS**, recent discourses questioning the veracity of historical accounts on injustices experienced by the Bangsamoro people and other communities involved in the conflict underscore the need for a nationwide approach to transitional justice and reconciliation;

**NOW, THEREFORE**, be it

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to call for the creation of the National Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Commission for the Bangsamoro as contained in the report of the TJRC.

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, to call on the ICCMN to include in its priorities the creation of the NTJRCB and the formulation of a Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Program for implementation not only in the BARMM but across the nation.

**RESOLVED FINALLY**, that a copy of this Resolution be furnished the Senate through its President, the House of Representatives through its Speaker, the ICCMN through its Secretariat (the Office of the Presidential Adviser on Peace, Reconciliation, and Unity), and the Office of the Chief Minister.

**Adopted**, January 24, 2020.
