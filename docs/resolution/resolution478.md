**WHEREAS**, Section 2 of Republic Act No. 11053 defines “*hazing*” as any act that results in physical or psychological suffering, harm, or injury inflicted on a recruit, neophyte, applicant, or member as part of an initiation rite or practice made as a prerequisite for admission or a requirement for continuing membership in a fraternity, sorority, or organization, including, but not limited to paddling, whipping, beating, branding, forced calisthenics, exposure to the weather, forced consumption of any food, liquor, beverage, drug or other substance, or any other brutal treatment or forced physical activity which is likely to adversely affect the physical and psychological health of such recruit, neophyte, applicant, or member. This shall also include any activity, intentionally made or otherwise, by one person alone or acting with others, that tends to humiliate or embarrass, degrade, abuse, or endanger, by requiring a recruit, neophyte, applicant, or member to do menial, silly, or foolish tasks;

**WHEREAS**, during initiation rites, hazing is conducted, which is defined as “*ceremonies, practices, rituals, or other acts, whether formal or informal, that a person must perform or take part in order to be accepted into a fraternity, sorority, or organization as a full-fledged member*”, as stated in Section 2 (b) of the aforementioned Republic Act;

**WHEREAS**, there is a need to further educate and remind the public, especially college and post-graduate students, about the realities of hazing and the provisions of this Act;

**WHEREAS**, conducting seminars and orientations for the public, especially in the communities, regarding the ban on hazing as a means of admission and continuing membership to any organization, association, society, fraternity, and sorority can help educate and dissuade the Bangsamoro people from engaging in any form of hazing as a condition for entering any organization, association society, fraternity, or sorority:

**NOW, THEREFORE**, be it

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, To urge the Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education to include in its programs, an awareness raising on the pertinent provisions of the Anti-Hazing Act of 2018 for the Higher Education Institutions in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.
