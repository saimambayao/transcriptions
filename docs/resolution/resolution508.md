**RESOLUTION EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE IMMEDIATE PASSAGE OF SENATE BILL NO. 2817, ENTITLED “AN ACT STRENGTHENING THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, AMENDING FOR THE PURPOSE PERTINENT PROVISIONS OF BATAS PAMBANSA BLG. 881, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE ‘OMNIBUS ELECTION CODE’, AS AMENDED, PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES”, SEEKING TO STRENGTHEN THE FIELD OFFICES OF THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, INCLUDING THE BANGSAMORO ELECTORAL OFFICE**

**WHEREAS**, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), an independent Constitutional Commission established under the 1987 Constitution, is mandated to enforce and administer election laws, thereby ensuring the conduct of honest, orderly, and peaceful elections;

**WHEREAS**, the improvements in our election systems, the continued increase in the number of registered voters, the introduction of mandatory continuing registration system, and the increasing administrative tasks of the Commission necessitate a larger and more robust workforce or personnel who are covered and protected by civil service laws and regulations;

**WHEREAS**, despite this constitutional independence, Congress retains the power to create offices as one of the legislative functions;

**WHEREAS**, as a result, the Commission’s authority to appoint competent civil service employees is limited by the offices created by Congress, leaving the Commission with no visible alternative but to hire contractual employees and issue job orders, which may undermine the rationale for civil service employment as envisioned by our Constitution and existing laws;

**WHEREAS**, the present system for hiring contractual employees of the Commission is detrimental to those employees, as there is a significant disparity between their tasks and the compensation offered by the Commission;

**WHEREAS**, Section 2 of Republic Act No. 6713, otherwise known as the *“Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees”*, establishes that in the State’s pursuit of accountability, public officials and employees must, at all times, discharge their duties with utmost responsibility, integrity, competence, and loyalty, while acting with patriotism and justice, thereby imposing a reciprocal obligation on the State to provide these employees with what is rightfully due to them;

**WHEREAS**, on January 16, 2021, the House of Representatives approved on final reading House Bill No. 10579, seeking to strengthen field offices of the COMELEC by, among other measures, increasing the number of personnel in those field offices;

**WHEREAS**, Senate Bill No. 857, an equivalent Senate version of the proposed Act sponsored by Senator Ramon Bong Revilla, Jr. entitled *“An Act Reorganizing the Offices of the Commission on Elections and Reclassifying the Plantilla Positions in the Agency”*, was filed in the Senate and referred to the Committees on Electoral Reform and People’s Participation; Civil Service, Government Reorganization and Professional Regulation; and Finance;

**WHEREAS**, the said bill likewise aims to strengthen the field offices of the COMELEC by creating new positions, reclassifying existing ones, and upgrading their salaries, thereby amending for the purpose Section 53 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881, otherwise known as the *“Omnibus Election Code of the Philippines;”*

**WHEREAS**, on September 11, 2024, the Senate Committees on Electoral Reform and People’s Participation; Civil Service, Government Reorganization and Professional Regulation; and Finance submitted Committee Report No. 318, recommending the approval of substituted Senate Bill No. 2817, entitled *“An Act Strengthening the Independence of the Commission on Elections, Amending for the Purpose Pertinent Provisions of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881, Otherwise Known as the ‘Omnibus Election Code,’ as Amended, Providing Funds Therefor, and for Other Purposes:”*

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, To express support for the immediate passage of Senate Bill No. 2817, entitled *“An Act Strengthening the Independence of the Commission on Elections, Amending for the Purpose Pertinent Provisions of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881, Otherwise Known as the ‘Omnibus Election Code’, as Amended, Providing Funds Therefor, and for Other Purposes”*, seeking to strengthen the field offices of the Commission on Elections, including the Bangsamoro Electoral Office.
