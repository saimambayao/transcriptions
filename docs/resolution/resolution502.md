**THIRD REGULAR SESSION**

**PARLIAMENT RESOLUTION NO. 502**

**RESOLUTION URGING THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MINISTER AND THE MINISTRY OF BASIC, HIGHER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION TO DEVISE A MECHANISM THAT WILL INCENTIVIZE FAMILIES WITH AT LEAST THREE HIGH SCHOOL AND/OR COLLEGE STUDENTS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE COMPLETION OF THE STUDENTS’ SCHOOLING**

**WHEREAS**, Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the *“Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao”*, enumerates the basic rights of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. As part of social justice, Section 8 provides, in part, that the Bangsamoro Government shall provide, maintain, and ensure the delivery of basic and responsive quality education;

**WHEREAS**, according to the World Bank in its article titled *“Unlocking the Potential of the Bangsamoro People through the Alternative Learning System”*, in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), only one (1) in every ten (10) students who began primary education completes junior high school education on time. Moreover, out-of-school youth and adults have accumulated over the decades, with their percentage being forty-five percent (45%), which is double the national average;

**WHEREAS**, in June 2021, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) assisted seventeen (17) private higher education institutions (HEIs) in the BARMM to be included in the CHED Registry to benefit from the programs under Republic Act No. 10931, or the *“Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act”*. According to CHED Chairman Popoy De Vera, BARMM still has the highest poverty incidence among all regions, which was further worsened by the pandemic. This led the CHED to assist the seventeen (17) HEIs to be qualified in the validation for Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES) beneficiaries. Chairman De Vera stated that access to free and quality tertiary education will continue to be offered for disadvantaged Filipino students by giving them additional funds to help them cope with the pandemic and cover not only their educational needs but also their living expenses;

**WHEREAS**, according to the CHED, for Academic Year (A.Y.) 2020-2021, some forty-two thousand seven hundred nine (42,709) students in state universities and colleges in the BARMM are benefiting from free higher education. Moreover, in the first year of implementation of the TES Program in A.Y. 2018-2019, ten thousand nine hundred sixty-five (10,965) TES grantees were registered both for public and private HEIs in the region. In A.Y. 2019-2020, the number increased to seventeen thousand nine hundred sixty-seven (17,967) and in A.Y. 2021-2022, it leaped to nineteen thousand eight hundred seventy-six (19,876);

**WHEREAS**, there is a need to strengthen the delivery of secondary and tertiary education in the BARMM;

**WHEREAS**, sending students to school should be seen as an opportunity rather than an additional burden for Bangsamoro families, and keeping students in school should be a top priority in the BARMM;

**WHEREAS**, government assistance through CHED has been given to HEIs and more and more grantees for subsidies have been recorded over the past three (3) academic years from 2019 to 2022. Furthermore, several other scholarship grants are being given by the government;

**WHEREAS**, the incentive mechanism shall be limited to families with at least three (3) high school and/or college students enrolled in public and private institutions within the BARMM, ensuring that assistance is directed towards those families who face significant financial challenges in supporting multiple children in their educational pursuits;

**WHEREAS**, other than scholarships and subsidies, to keep students in school and to attract families to keep on sending their family members to school, the Office of the Chief Minister and the Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education should work together to provide more opportunities for families to keep students in school. Thus, the said offices should devise a mechanism to incentivize families with at least three (3) students who are in secondary or tertiary education:

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, To urge the Office of the Chief Minister and the Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education to devise a mechanism that will incentivize families with at least three high school and/or college students, in order to ensure the completion of the students’ schooling.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, To forward the foregoing Resolution to the Office of the Chief Minister and the Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education, for information.

**ADOPTED**, *Rabi Al-Akhir* 12, 1446/October 15, 2024.
