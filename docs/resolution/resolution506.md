**PARLIAMENT RESOLUTION NO. 506**

**RESOLUTION ENCOURAGING THE MINISTRY OF BASIC, HIGHER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION TO CONSIDER THE PROVISION OF FREE HYGIENE KITS, ESPECIALLY FREE SANITARY NAPKINS IN ALL PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL COMFORT ROOMS WITHIN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO**

**WHEREAS**, Section 3, Article V of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as *“Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (OLBARMM)”*, provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants;

**WHEREAS**, Section 8, Article IX of the OLBARMM states that the Bangsamoro Government shall provide, maintain, and ensure the delivery of basic and responsive health programs, quality education, appropriate services, livelihood opportunities, affordable and progressive housing projects, power and electricity, and water inhabitants of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS**, Section 22, Article IX of the same Organic Law also provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. It shall also uphold the peoples' right to have access to essential good health, and other social services that promote their well-being;

**WHEREAS**, we are facing a global phenomenon called *“period poverty”*, which according to Medical News Today, is defined as a lack of access to menstrual products, education, hygiene facilities, waste management, or a combination of these, and it affects an estimated five hundred (500) million people worldwide;

**WHEREAS**, included in the 12-point priority agenda of the Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education (MBHTE) is the creation of comprehensive health and nutrition programs in schools;

**WHEREAS**, public school toilets, apart from stocking products, such as toilet paper, soap, and paper towels, should also provide another basic necessity including menstrual products;

**WHEREAS**, menstruation is unpredictable and students may not have menstrual hygiene products on hand while in school. This can lead to leaving school early or absences in many young teens due to the lack of access to menstrual products;

**WHEREAS**, creating ease of access to free menstrual and hygiene products can ensure a healthy and enabling learning environment for the students to reach their maximum potential. It can increase their confidence, and improve their health and well-being outcomes, since a lack of access to these products can frustrate their ability to participate fully in their educational opportunities including co-curricular activities;

**WHEREAS**, having the provision of free menstrual products in every public school comfort room will ensure that every menstruating student gets access to sanitary pads easily. This is not only a provision of a basic need but a resolution of an issue of economics, equity, and basic needs also being met;

**WHEREAS**, sanitation and hygiene are crucial in menstrual hygiene management among girls. Poor hygiene during menstruation creates a perfect environment for bacteria to proliferate which may lead to bacterial infection, which will eventually lead to poor performance of students in their studies. Therefore, providing these products allows the students to manage their menstrual hygiene with dignity;

**WHEREAS**, in furtherance of the mandate of MBHTE in creating comprehensive health programs for the students, it is imperative for the said ministry to create a plan to provide free menstrual hygiene products in all public school comfort rooms and to continue offering them to students:

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, To encourage the Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education to consider the provision of free hygiene kits, especially free sanitary napkins, in all public high school comfort rooms within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, To forward the foregoing Resolution to the Ministry of Basic Higher, and Technical Education, for consideration and appropriate action.

**ADOPTED**, *Rabi Al-Akhir* 19, 1446/October 22, 2024.
