**WHEREAS**, on February 4, 1977, Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1083 otherwise known as the “*Code of Muslim Personal Laws of the Philippines*” was enacted;

**WHEREAS**, the P.D. 1083 established Shari’ah District Courts (SDCs) and Shari’ah Circuit Courts (SCCs) (Art. 138, P.D. No. 1083), which provide for their appointment, qualifications, tenure, compensation, station, procedure, and jurisdiction (Arts. 139 to 149, P.D. No. 1083);

**WHEREAS**, the abovementioned decree courts are not situated nationwide as they were only established in the provinces of Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, Basilan, Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, North Cotabato, and Sultan Kudarat, and the cities of Dipolog, Pagadian, Zamboanga, Iligan, Marawi, Lamitan, and Cotabato;

**WHEREAS**, given the limited area of jurisdiction of the Shari’ah courts, Muslims outside these territorial jurisdictions are deprived of access to Shari’ah personal laws and the justice system, thus creating a demand for additional Shari’ah courts to cover the whole country and make these courts accessible;

**WHEREAS**, Republic Act No. 12018 is the result of the consolidated Senate Bill No. 2594 and House Bill No. 8257, which both sought the establishment of Shari’ah courts in various cities and provinces, aiming to expand the Shari’ah judicial system in the Philippines to ensure that Muslim Filipinos can avail of accessible, equitable, and speedy justice;

**WHEREAS**, Senate Bill No. 2594, which was approved by the Senate on August 12, 2024, was authored by Senators Robinhood C. Padilla, Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa, and Win Gatchalian, and sponsored by the Justice and Human Rights Committee chairperson, Sen. Francis “Tol” N. Tolentino, while House Bill No. 8257, approved as filed on August 14, 2023, was introduced by Representatives Mohammad Khalid Q. Dimaporo, Juliet Marie D. Ferrer, Stella Luz A. Quimbo, Elizaldy S. Co, and Raymond Democrito C. Mendoza, among others;

**WHEREAS**, Republic Act No. 12018 has effectively covered all territorial jurisdictions in the country, ensuring that no one will be left out in accessing SDCs and SCCs, representing a significant advancement in the promotion of the rights and welfare of the Muslim community and ensuring more accessible and efficient delivery of justice in accordance with Islamic law;

**WHEREAS**, the establishment of these new Shari’ah courts further strengthens the implementation and enforcement of the P.D. No. 1083, thereby ensuring that the legal rights and cultural practices of Muslim Filipinos are duly recognized and upheld within the framework of the national legal system;

**WHEREAS**, the three additional SDCs will cover the following areas: the sixth district will include Bukidnon, Misamis Oriental, Misamis Occidental, Camiguin, Cagayan de Oro City, and the provinces in the Davao Region and Caraga; the seventh district will encompass the provinces within Western Visayas, Eastern Visayas, and Central Visayas; and the eighth district will cover Metro Manila, the provinces within the Cordillera Administrative Region, and Regions I to Mindoro, Marinduque, Romblon, and Palawan (MIMAROPA);

**WHEREAS**, the new law also expanded the number of SCCs from 51 to 63, with 12 additional courts established to serve the newly created SDCs. Of these, five courts will be in and serve the sixth district, three in the seventh district, and four in the eighth Shari’ah district;

**WHEREAS**, the enactment of this law reflects the commitment of President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. the Senate of the Philippines, and the House of Representatives to the principle of inclusive governance, recognizing the importance of providing adequate legal infrastructure to address the unique needs of the Muslim Filipino population;

**WHEREAS**, this legislative achievement is a testament to the dedication of our national leaders in promoting peace, justice, and the rule of law, particularly in regions where the Muslim Filipino community resides:
