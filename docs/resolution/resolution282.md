**RESOLUTION COMMENDING THE SECURITY SECTOR AND THE VOLUNTEERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE SEARCH, RESCUE, AND RETRIEVAL OPERATIONS OF THE VICTIMS OF SEVERE TROPICAL STORM PAENG IN DATU ODIN SINSUAT AND DATU BLAH SINSUAT, MAGUINDANAO DEL NORTE**

**WHEREAS,** on October 26 to 29, 2022, Tropical Storm *Nalgae*, known in the Philippines as Severe Tropical Storm *Paeng*, hit the Philippines;

**WHEREAS,** the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) issued a Memorandum on October 26, 2022, directing its members, including the Bangsamoro Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (BDRRMC), to activate the Bravo Emergency Preparedness and Response (EPR) protocol immediately. The region’s DRRM was directed to send warnings and advisories, and cascade emergency preparedness and response protocols in connection with the then-tropical depression *Paeng*;

**WHEREAS,** the heavy rains brought about by the storm resulted in the loss of lives and the destruction of property of thousands of Filipino people across multiple regions in the Philippines;

**WHEREAS,** on November 2, 2022, President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr issued Proclamation No. 84 placing Region IV-A (CALABARZON), V (Bicol Region), VI (Western Visayas), and the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) under a state of calamity for six (6) months, in response to the devastation brought by Severe Tropical Storm *Paeng*;

**WHEREAS,** under the same Proclamation, all concerned government departments and agencies were directed to continue the implementation of rescue, relief, and rehabilitation measures in areas affected by the storm;

**WHEREAS,** the NDRRMC on November 6, 2022, reported that the death toll from the Severe Tropical Storm *Paeng* stood at one hundred fifty-six (156). They reported one hundred twenty-one (121) confirmed fatalities, one hundred forty-one (141) injured persons, and thirty-seven (37) missing persons. The BARMM has the greatest number of deaths with sixty-three (63) fatalities, followed by CALABARZON with thirty-four (34), and Western Visayas with thirty-three (33);

**WHEREAS,** the municipalities of Datu Odin Sinsuat and Datu Blah Sinsuat in Maguindanao del Norte were greatly affected by the said storm. Specifically, Barangay Kusiong in Datu Odin Sinsuat was considered as the “ground zero” of the devastation caused by the tropical storm. This is because it is said to be *Paeng’s* hardest hit area after a vast muddy mound covered the site due to flash floods and landslides which buried people and houses;

**WHEREAS,** community and social efforts were done by fellow Filipinos at the earliest opportunity to help those who were greatly affected by the storm;

**WHEREAS,** many local residents helped and volunteered in the search, rescue, and retrieval of the victims of the storm in Maguindanao del Norte, especially prior to the arrival of the teams from the security sector;

**WHEREAS,** the security sector composed of the 6th Infantry Division of the Philippine Army, the BARMM’s Police Regional Office (PRO-BAR), the Philippine Coast Guard, the Bureau of Fire Protection, and the Bangsamoro Rapid Emergency Action on Disaster Incidence (READi) participated in the search, rescue, and retrieval operations;

**WHEREAS,** the proliferation of volunteers all over the Bangsamoro Region is proof that the Filipino spirit of “*Bayanihan*” is alive and that even though the Bangsamoro people are facing hardship themselves, they remain resilient and willing to help others who are more in need;

**WHEREAS,** the volunteers displayed shared virtues of compassion, selflessness, devotion, and love for their fellowmen;

**WHEREAS,** the selflessness of these volunteers amid the pandemic must be encouraged and commended as this highlights the notion that everyone has a role and duty to play in ensuring that our fellow Bangsamoro are safe during any disaster;

**WHEREAS,** the BTA is extending its commendations to all those who volunteered in helping those who were greatly affected by the storm;

**WHEREAS,** also, the BTA commiserates with those affected and expresses its profound sympathies to the families who lost their loved ones:

**NOW, THEREFORE,** be it

**RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, To Commend the Security Sector and Volunteers who participated in the search, rescue, and retrieval operations of the victims of Severe Tropical Storm *Paeng* in Datu Odin Sinsuat and Datu Blah Sinsuat, Maguindanao del Norte.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER,** That a copy of this Resolution be presented to the Security Sector and Volunteers.

**ADOPTED,** Jumada Al-Awwal 26, 1444/December 20, 2022.
