**RESOLUTION NO. 52**

**RESOLUTION RESPECTFULLY APPEALING TO HIS EXCELENCY PRESIDENT RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE NOT TO PUSH THROUGH THE PUTTING UP OF ADDITIONAL MILITARY CAMP (INSIDE THE MOST AFFECTED AREA) IN THE ISLAMIC CITY OF MARAWI**

**WHEREAS**, on October 14, 2019, two years after the bloody and destructive siege of theIslamic City of Marawi which left hundreds of thousands to flee and homeless, thousands dead and turned rubbles part of the city which is now known as the Most Affected Area (MAA), the Philippine Army announced its plans to build new military camps within the City;

**WHEREAS**, there is an increasing and actual imminent fear by the people of Lanao del Sur and its capital, Marawi, that these military camps may be established in certain areas of the city, particularly Barangays Caloocan East and Kapantaran, after the Philippine Army was able to secure writs of possession for more than 10 hectares of land within these locales;

**WHEREAS**, rationalization of the need to establish additional camp in the city is best capsulized in the words of Major General Jesus Sarsagat, Army Chief of Staff of the Philippine Army which states:

> *“The legal possession of the land enables the Philippine Army to efficiently accomplish its mission. It is a strategic location to protect the people [of Marawi] against terrorism.” (Italics Supplied)*

**WHEREAS**, according to the UNHCR Philippines Mindanao Displacement Dashboard, there are still 73, 266 people displaced and thousands of people still need humanitarian aid and rely for government aid and other aids coming from either international or national organizations who have continuously provided for basic necessities to the most vulnerable displaced people;

**WHEREAS**, the slow-paced rehabilitation of MAA prevents the displaced residents from returning to their homes and adding agony thereto is the issue of land ownership over which some lands are allegedly within military reservation thereby forbidding others to return permanently to their land in addition to the displacement which will be caused by the proposed rehabilitation. As clearly pointed-out by the then Senior Justice of the Supreme Court, Justice Carpio in his recent visit to Marawi which proclaims:

> *“Imagine, large group of people whose parents, grandparents were born there, grew up there but now they are being deprived of their land. This large group would be susceptible to propaganda and influence by the ISIS-Maute group and we may have another rebellion if they are deprived of their land.” (Italics Supplied)”;*

**WHEREAS**, on the basis of the foregoing, it can be gleaned that the residents of the Islamic City of Marawi especially the most vulnerable ones who until now are displaced have pressing and immediate issues which does not include the installations of additional military camps in the midst of the slow-paced rehabilitation accompanied by the other contentious issues that directly affect them;

**WHEREAS**, if the primary purpose of putting-up a additional military camp is to thwart any terrorism or any terroristic atrocity/activity in the area, the same can be prevented by the coordinated work of the local government, local leaders, the community, the police and military in the area in so far as monitoring, prevention, effective governance and intelligence information gathering;

**WHEREAS**, the planned setting-up of additional military camp were done without prior consultation with the leaders and the people in the area whereby negating the constitutional rights of the people the rights to be informed;

**WHEREAS**, the residents of the Islamic City of Marawi and the Province of Lanao del Sur has been very vocal in their absolute opposition in the installation of additional military camps especially in the midst of the status of the rehabilitation in the area;

**WHEREAS**, the most effective tool in fighting the so-called terrorism is winning the heart of the populace to support the government in quelling the roots of terrorism and not to further militarize the place where people have gone through so much sufferings in light of their horrendous experience for the so many decades of conflict; and

**NOW, THEREFORE**, be it

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament expresses its opposition in the establishment of other military camps in the Most Affected Area (MAA), Islamic City of Marawi, Province of Lanao del Sur.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, to respectfully appeal to His Excellency President Rodrigo Roa Duterte not to push through the planned establishment of another military camp in the Islamic City of Marawi.
