**WHEREAS**, paper consumption is globally increasing at an unsustainable level leading to increasing greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, carbon emissions, and wastewater discharge;

**WHEREAS**, the Pulp and Paper Industry is one of the most pollution-causing industries in the entire world due to its discharge of hazardous chemical compounds present in the wastewater after pulp and paper production;

**WHEREAS**, there exists an urgent need to reduce the Bangsamoro Government’s use of unnecessary and excessive quantities of paper to reduce the negative impact of pulp and paper production on our environment;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Government can positively make a lasting impact on the movement towards sustainable ecological practices with the end view of saving our old-growth forests, conserving our precious water, and avoiding the devastating impacts of climate change;

**WHEREAS**, it is high time the Bangsamoro Government takes urgent action to combat climate change by initiating the first step to improve awareness and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, and impact reduction:

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, To provide for the efficient use of paper rule for the parliament:

**EFFICIENT USE OF PAPER RULE OF THE BANGSAMORO PARLIAMENT**

**SECTION 1. *Title*.** – This Rule shall be known and cited as the “*Efficient Use of Paper Rule of the Bangsamoro Parliament.*”

**SEC. 2. *Applicability*.** – This Rule shall apply to the Bangsamoro Parliament, its committees, sub-committees, and all other offices of the Parliament as well as to all ministries, offices, and agencies of the Bangsamoro Government in their communications, correspondence and similar submissions to the Bangsamoro Parliament.

The following margins shall be observed on all papers: a left-hand margin of 1.5 inches from the edge; an upper margin of 1.2 inches from the edge; a right-hand margin of 1.0 inches from the edge; and a lower margin of 1.0 inches from the edge. Every page must be consecutively numbered.

Further, a copy in PDF file of such document shall be filed electronically to the official email address of the concerned office.

The PDF copy may be electronically generated from a word-processing or PDF creation program, or be scanned images of the document compiled in a PDF file, or a combination of both methods, but in all cases, the contents must be completely legible. The size of each PDF file must be reasonable to ensure that the receiving office’s official e-mail address service will not reject or block a transmittal email due to the file size of an attachment.

**SEC. 5. *Limitation on the Number of Printed Copies Distributed During Sessions, and Committee and Sub-Committee Meetings*.** – Copies of the Order of Business together with bills and resolutions, reports, and privilege speech included in the agenda for the applicable session date shall no longer be provided individually per Member of Parliament (MP). Only printed copies of the Order of Business will be provided in the session hall for ready access by any MP.

A copy of the same documents with corresponding annexes shall be emailed to all concerned, thus, encouraging the use of electronic documents.

It shall be the responsibility of the MP to reproduce a printed copy of the document/s as he/she may deem necessary.

**RESOLVED, FINALLY**, That this Resolution shall take effect immediately upon its approval.
