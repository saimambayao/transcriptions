RESOLUTION NO. 190

RESOLUTION COMMENDING MS. LORENA COQUIA, JAIL OFFICER I OF DAGUPAN CITY JAIL, FOR CAMPAIGNING FOR AND CONTRIBUTING TO THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THE HIJAB AND ALTERNATIVE UNIFORM FOR MUSLIMAH BJMP EMPLOYEES

WHEREAS, the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) issued a Memorandum on July 29, 2021, and Resolution No. 2021-23 (dated May 27, 2021), entitled “A Resolution Allowing Female Muslim BJMP Personnel To Wear Hijab When Wearing (BJMP) Prescribed Uniforms and the Use of Delta Pants and Black BJMP Long Sleeve Shirt as Their Alternative CVAC Uniform”;

WHEREAS, Jail Officer 1 Lorena Coquia, a Balik-Islam working at the Dagupan City Jail, had written the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF)-North Luzon requesting for assistance in coordinating with the BJMP National Headquarters to incorporate the hijab in their prescribed uniform;

WHEREAS, Ms. Coquia’s request was granted by NCMF-North Luzon through Atty. Nor-ainah Daragangan (Legal Affairs Division) and Regional Director Atty. Macarimpas, who corresponded immediately with Jail Dir. Alan S. Iral, BJMP Chief;

WHEREAS, the BJMP-Uniform and Standard Committee held an online conference to discuss Ms. Coquia’s proposal, which was unanimously approved on May 27, 2021;

WHEREAS, the freedom to practice one’s religion is a constitutional right, and the approval of the hijab and alternative uniform by a national agency is a welcome move and an immense development from previous incidences of discrimination experienced by Muslim Filipinos (e.g. imposing of a hijab ban, profiling and stereotyping by authorities and media, and unlawful or mistaken arrests):

NOW, THEREFORE, be it

RESOLVED, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to extend the utmost commendation to Ms. Lorena Coquia, Jail Officer I of Dagupan City Jail, for campaigning for and contributing to the institutionalization of the hijab and alternative uniform for Muslimah BJMP employees.

RESOLVED, FURTHER, that copies of this Resolution be forwarded to the Dagupan City Jail and the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos, for information and appropriate consideration.

ADOPTED, Rabi Al-akhir 18, 1443/November 23, 2021.
