**THIRD REGULAR SESSION**

**RESOLUTION NO. 131**

**RESOLUTION EXPRESSING THE DEEPEST GRATITUDE AND UNEQUIVOCAL SUPPORT OF THE BANGSAMORO PARLIAMENT TO SENATE BILL NO. 2081 AND HOUSE BILL NO. 8249, BOTH “DECLARING FEBRUARY 1 OF EVERY YEAR AS NATIONAL HIJAB DAY AND PROMOTING AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE MUSLIM TRADITION OF WEARING HIJAB”**

WHEREAS, the Almighty Allah has obliged Muslim women to “guard their modesty and not display their beauty and ornaments except what must ordinarily appear thereof”;

WHEREAS, the wearing of the *hijab*, is a fulfillment of the said obligation and has become a symbol of respect and integrity for Muslim women all over the world;

WHEREAS, Sec. 3, Article III of R.A. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) mandates the Bangsamoro Government to ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture of the Bangsamoro people;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Government upholds its commitment to protect the fundamental rights of women, to defend them from exploitation, abuse or discrimination, and to foster deep respect and understanding among and between people of varying cultures and faith towards unity and peace;

WHEREAS, February 1, 2013 marked the first annual World *Hijab* Day in recognition of millions of Muslim women who choose to wear the hijab and live a life of modesty. The *hijab* refers to any head, face or body covering conforming to a certain standard of modesty for Muslim women;

WHEREAS, House Bill No. 8249 introduced by Representatives Sangcopan, Balindong, Sinsuat, Dimaporo (M.K.), Savellano, Dimaporo (A.), Guya, Adiong, Hataman, and Nieto which was unanimously passed by the House of Representatives on January 26, 2021 and Senate Bill No. 2081 authored by Senator Juan Miguel F. Zubiri, both “Declaring February 1 of Every Year as National *Hijab* Day and Promoting an Understanding of the Muslim Tradition of Wearing a *Hijab*”, are another milestones under the administration of President Rodrigo R. Duterte, whose political will led to the creation of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, in further strengthening the national understanding and consciousness on Islam and the Muslim Filipinos whose unique tradition and culture not only enrich the nation’s history, but also contribute to the country’s development and progress;

WHEREAS, every day is *Hijab* Day for Muslims, however the national celebration allows for a greater consciousness on the national scale as to what exactly the hijab means for Muslims, that it is not just a piece of cloth nor is it something to be afraid of, but rather it is a way of life, sign of devotion, faith, and piety;

WHEREAS, the National *Hijab* Day is a fitting recognition of the role of the Filipino Muslim women in nation-building and their indispensable contribution to moral governance in all levels of the BARMM government;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Government was, through the Bangsamoro Women Commission, invited as a resource speaker for the Technical Working Group of the Senate Committee on Cultural Communities for its position and further enhancement on the bill, which shall be subject of committee meeting on July 6, 2021;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Parliament lauds and strongly supports both bills and calls on the Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives as an instrument of national unity and solidarity.

NOW, THEREFORE, be it

RESOLVED, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to express the deepest gratitude and unequivocal support of the Bangsamoro Parliament to Senate Bill No. 2081 and House Bill No. 8249 for declaring “February 1 of Every Year as National *Hijab* Day and Promoting an Understanding of the Muslim Tradition of Wearing *Hijab*”.
