**RESOLUTION EXPRESSING DEEP APPRECIATION TO THE PHILIPPINE GOVERNMENT FOR THE PASSAGE OF REPUBLIC ACT NO. 11054 AND PROCLAMATION NO. 1906 DECLARING THE WHOLE MONTH OF OCTOBER AS INDIGENOUS PEOPLES MONTH**

WHEREAS, the Philippines is a culturally diverse country with an estimated 14- 17 million Indigenous Peoples (IPs) belonging to one hundred ten (110) ethno-linguistic groups. Of this number, more than one hundred thousand (100,000) are estimated to be found in the Bangsamoro, mostly called as the Non-Moro Indigenous Peoples;

WHEREAS, indigenous peoples are considered as keepers of our rich cultural heritage, being the first nation that inhabited this Earth before any civilization came. Their rich indigenous knowledge systems and practices and wealth of experience might provide the key in addressing the current challenges faced by our modern society;

WHEREAS, Section 22 of the Philippine Constitution stipulates that “the State recognizes and promotes the rights of the indigenous cultural communities within the framework of national unity and development”;

WHEREAS, in pursuance of this provision, the Philippine government passed into law Republic Act 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), to protect, promote, support and recognize the rights of the Indigenous Peoples in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

WHEREAS, former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo issued Presidential Proclamation No. 1906, series of 2009, declaring the month of October as Indigenous Peoples month;

WHEREAS, the passage of the BOL and the declaration of October as IP Month is a leap forward in the effort to protect, promote, support and preserve the rights of the Indigenous Peoples;

WHEREAS, the Ministry of Indigenous People’s Affairs as the lead agency for the protection of the welfare and rights of the Indigenous People in Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is hereby tasked to spearhead programs in celebration of the Indigenous People’s Rights Act under the Bangsamoro Organic Law:

NOW, THEREFORE, be it

RESOLVED, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, to express deep appreciation to the Philippine Government for the passage of Republic Act No. 11054 and Proclamation No. 1906 declaring the whole month of October as Indigenous Peoples Month.
