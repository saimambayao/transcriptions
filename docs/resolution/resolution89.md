WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Organic Law (R.A. 11054) was enacted into law to put an end to the persistent armed violence in Mindanao specifically the Bangsamoro Region and usher in lasting peace and development founded on mutual trust and cooperation;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro People have overwhelmingly ratified the Bangsamoro Organic Law manifesting their hopes and desires to finally put an end to the decades of armed struggle that have not only thwarted development in their areas but have also caused needless sufferings and violence that have threatened their dignity as Filipinos and as human beings;

WHEREAS, the Organic Law as an instrument of peace can be sustained only if senseless violence committed against civilians can immediately be addressed through an impartial and swift yet thorough investigation to bring into justice those who are liable irrespective of status and affiliation;

WHEREAS, on August 29, 2020, nine individuals, all identified as Bangsamoro, were helplessly gunned down in the provincial road of Kabacan, Cotabato Province by still unidentified perpetrators armed with high-powered weapons;

WHEREAS, the shooting incident, which many see as a gruesome massacre, must be immediately acted by the authorities through an impartial investigation that will not only pinpoint those who are responsible but will shed light as well to the reasons behind the senseless, cowardly and horrendous killing;

WHEREAS, the need for swift rendition of justice is a must especially that the senseless killing was committed at a time when the Filipino people as a nation should be united in the fight against this COVID-19 global pandemic and aggravated by a notion of trying to destabilize the peace established by mutual respect, trust, and cooperation embedded in the Organic Law;

NOW, THEREFORE, be it

RESOLVED, as it is hereby resolved, to strongly condemn the massacre of nine (9) civilians in Kabacan, Cotabato province and respectfully request the Philippine National Police (PNP), the National Bureau Of Investigation (NBI) and the Commission On Human Rights (CHR) to fast-track the conduct of their investigation thereon so that the perpetrators of the dastardly act can be brought to justice and immediately punished.
