**THIRD REGULAR SESSION**

**RESOLUTION NO. 222**

**RESOLUTION DIRECTING THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES, AND AGRARIAN REFORM (MAFAR) TO MODIFY THE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS IN ITS PROCUREMENT OF MOTORIZED BANCA FROM FIBERGLASS BOATS TO WOODEN HULLED BOATS AND EXPEDITE THE PROCUREMENT AND FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THEIR MOTORIZED BOAT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM**

**WHEREAS**, Sections 2 and 7, Article IV of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) pertinently provide that:

> “**Section 2.** Self-Governance. In the exercise of its right to self-governance, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is free to pursue its political, economic, social, and cultural development as provided for in this Organic Law.
> 
> **Section 7.** Social Justice. - The Bangsamoro Government shall ensure every Filipino citizen in its territorial jurisdiction the provision of the basic necessities and equal opportunities in life. Xxx”

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) has been accorded greater autonomy that is farther in reach than its predecessor and thus can validly conduct its government affairs with minimal intervention, if not none, from the national government agencies;

**WHEREAS**, pursuant to the provisions of Section 8, Article IX of the Bangsamoro Organic Law mandating the Bangsamoro Government to “provide, maintain, and ensure the delivery of xxx, livelihood opportunities”, the MAFAR proposed the project “Municipal Payao” and “Basnigan with Fishing Net”, which included the procurement and distribution of fiberglass hulled motorized boats to our marginalized and individual fishermen in the year 2020;

**WHEREAS**, the said procurement activities included the purchase of Motorized Banca with the following Technical Specifications:

a. 30-footer fiberglass boat; and
b. 20-footer with paddle, made of fiberglass reinforcement boat;

**WHEREAS**, the implementation of the above projects is long overdue as it has been allotted in 2020, to the detriment of the communities in the Bangsamoro Region;

**WHEREAS**, per information from MAFAR, the delay was due to lack of responsive bidders in the procurement of fiberglass hulled motorized boats resulting in multiple failure of bidding;

**WHEREAS**, per information from MAFAR, the initiative to resort to fiberglass hulled motorized boats was to conform to the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) Circular No. 2016-02 or the Revised Rules on The Phase Out of Wooden-hulled Ships Carrying Passengers in Domestic Shipping;

**WHEREAS**, MARINA Circular No. 2016-02 provides for the Revised Rules on the Phase-out of Wooden-Hulled Ships that is intended for carrying passengers in domestic shipping and not for fishing purposes;

**WHEREAS**, a closer look at the specific requirement of the Ministry shows that the procurement of fiberglass hulled motorized boat may not be practicable in most areas and in most cases due to: (1) its weight compared to the wooden-hulled boat of the same size and dimensions; (2) difficulty to maintain or to repair damage as there are no trained fiberglass workers; (3) poor craftmanship of the fiberglass boat is easily concealable and difficult to detect; (4) fiberglass becomes considerably weaker when exposed to repetitive stress as compared to a wood/epoxy boat;

**WHEREAS**, fishing cooperatives have consistently requested for the provision of wooden-hulled boats instead of fiberglass boats for the following reasons:

1. Wooden-hulled boats are easier to repair because of availability of materials unlike that of fiberglass boats;
2. In terms of seaworthiness, wooden-hulled boats are easier to maneuver whereas fiberglass boats are heavier and difficult to manage when sailing on rough waters;
3. In case of accidents causing damage to the hull, wooden-hulled boats remain afloat while fiberglass boats sink; and
4. By centuries-old practice, wooden-hulled boats have been continuously and heavily relied upon, trusted, and used by fisherfolks in the Bangsamoro Region.

**WHEREAS**, the procurement by MAFAR of *Municipal Payao* and *Basnigan with Fishing Net* is devoted for the use of regular fisherfolks to assist them in their livelihood and not for the purpose of carrying passengers;

**WHEREAS**, the fact is wooden-hulled motorized boat is not purely made of wood, but of marine epoxy-coated plywood and therefore does not contribute to the degradation of our environment;

**WHEREAS**, the absence of a reliable and established fiberglass boat maker in the Region further contributes to the delay of the implementation of this project to the prejudice of our marginalized fishermen and our constituents;

**WHEREAS**, the fishermen in our Region are accustomed to using the wooden-hulled boats and they are proven to be sturdy, lighter, easier to make and maintain, and similar type of boat are also being given away by some local government units;

**WHEREAS**, because of the difficulty in procuring fiberglass boats, the MAFAR has already removed provision of motorized banca in its 2021 development programs because of the fiberglass issue, to the prejudice and detriment of the fisherfolks especially in the Island Provinces of Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi, as well as coastal communities of Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur:

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, To direct Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Agrarian Reform to modify the technical specifications in its procurement of motorized banca from fiberglass boats to wooden hulled boats and expedite the procurement and full implementation of their motorized boat distribution program.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, To forward the foregoing Resolution to the MAFAR-BARMM, for information and appropriate consideration.

**ADOPTED**, Rajab 22, 1443/February 24, 2022.
