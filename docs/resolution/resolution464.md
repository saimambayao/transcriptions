**WHEREAS**, Section 5, Article II of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides that the maintenance of peace and order, the protection of life, liberty, and property, and the promotion of the general welfare are essential for the enjoyment by all the people of the blessings of democracy, and Section 5, Article III thereof states that no law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.

**WHEREAS**, Section 4 of Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054, known as the “*Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao*”, states that the Bangsamoro Government shall guarantee religious freedom and its free exercise in accordance with the Constitution, national laws, and principles of international law. It also mandates that the Bangsamoro Government protect all individuals from harassment, undue pressure, coercion, and violence on account of religion;

**WHEREAS**, Section 4 of Republic Act No. 11479, or the “*Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020*”, defines terrorism for purposes of acts penalized by the said law as follows:

“*Section 4. Terrorism – Subject to Section 49 of this Act, terrorism is committed by any person who, within or outside the Philippines, regardless of the stage of execution:*

*(a) Engages in acts intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to any person, or endangers a person’s life;*

*(b) Engages in acts intended to cause extensive damage or destruction to a government or public facility, public place, or private property;*

*xxx*

*When the purpose of such act, by its nature and context, is to intimidate the general public or a segment thereof, create an atmosphere, or spread a message of fear xxx shall be guilty of committing terrorism and shall suffer the penalty of life imprisonment xxx.*”

**WHEREAS**, on May 19, 2024, during the observance of Pentecost Sunday, also commemorating the 1991 World Wide Founding Anniversary of the Catholic Church, the serene Liturgy of the Word underway at Sto. Niño Chapel, Purok Bagong Silang, Rosary Heights 3, Cotabato City, was violently interrupted by the detonation of a hand grenade inside the chapel;

**WHEREAS**, according to the Cotabato City Explosive Canine Unit (CECU), initial investigation indicated that a lever from an M-26 hand grenade was found at the scene;

**WHEREAS**, Cotabato City Police Director Colonel Querubin Manalang, Jr. reported that the grenade explosion resulted in injuries of two individuals: Marybel Atis, aged 40, and Rosita Tubilo, a 65-year-old senior citizen, both residents of Rosary Heights 3, Cotabato City;

**WHEREAS**, five months ago, the region experienced similar bombing incidents, notably when a Catholic mass ceremony was disrupted by an explosion at the Mindanao State University (MSU) Gymnasium in Marawi City, resulting in the tragic deaths of four (4) individuals and injuries to fifty (50) others;

**WHEREAS**, on the morning of January 27, 2019, two (2) bombs exploded at Roman Catholic Cathedral of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Jolo, Sulu, claiming the lives of twenty (20) people and eighty (82) injured;

**WHEREAS**, these incidents, sparking various speculations across different media platforms regarding their potential causes, also sow fear among our constituents, especially the settler communities, potentially causing our settler brothers and sisters to hesitate to attend places of worship or engage in religious practices and activities, fearing for their safety and security within our community, a consequence that should deeply concern the Bangsamoro Government, dedicated to preventing such situations, as the right to practice one’s religion freely is a fundamental entitlement that every individual should rightfully enjoy;

**WHEREAS**, this Resolution aims to put an end to these condemnable acts, recognizing that they are not only illegal but also undermine our endeavors to cultivate a harmonious society, with the Bangsamoro Government remaining resolute in its commitment to safeguarding the safety and security of our constituents as they participate in community activities and endeavor towards peaceful coexistence:

**NOW, THEREFORE**, be it

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, To condemn the terrorist attack on May 19, 2024 at Sto. Niño Chapel, Purok Bagong Silang, Rosary Heights 3, Cotabato City, and appeal to the concerned authorities to expedite the investigation and bring the perpetrator(s) to justice.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, To forward a copy of this Resolution to concerned authorities, for information.

**ADOPTED**, *Dhu Al-Hijjah* 13, 1445/June 19, 2024.
