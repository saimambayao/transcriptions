**RESOLUTION CALLING ON THE MINISTRY OF PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY TO FORMULATE AND SUBMIT TO THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MINISTER A REGIONAL REINTEGRATION PROGRAM FOR REBEL RETURNEES, AND OTHER ARMED GROUPS RETURNING TO THE FOLDS OF THE LAW**

**WHEREAS**, Article II of the 1987 Constitution declares the State’s policy of renouncing war as an instrument of national policy;

**WHEREAS**, Article II also declares the following principles and policies of the State that the maintenance of peace and order, the protection of life, liberty, and property, and the promotion of the general welfare are essential for the enjoyment by all the people of the blessings of democracy, and it shall promote a just and dynamic social order that will ensure the prosperity and independence of the nation and free the people from poverty through policies that provide adequate social services, promote full employment, a rising standard of living, and an improved quality of life for all;

**WHEREAS**, pursuant to these principles and policies, the National Government entered into a Comprehensive Agreement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), leading to the passage, ratification, and implementation of the Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the *“Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao;”*

**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Article V of the Republic Act No. 11054 states that among the powers granted to the Bangsamoro Government are: (a) administration of justice; (b) customary laws; (c) development programs and laws for women, labor, the youth, the elderly, the differently-abled, and indigenous peoples; (d) disaster risk reduction and management; (e) education and skills training; (f) housing and human settlements; (g) humanitarian service and institutions; (h) human rights; (i) labor, employment, and occupation;

**WHEREAS**, Section 3, Article V of the same Act empowers the Bangsamoro Government to promote health and safety, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants;

**WHEREAS**, Section 6, Article IV of the same Act declares it the policy of the Bangsamoro Government to promote social justice, unity, peace, justice, and goodwill among all peoples, and Section 7, Article IV of the same Act encourage a just and peaceful settlement of disputes and to ensure every Filipino citizen in its territorial jurisdiction the provision of the basic necessities and equal opportunities in life;

**WHEREAS**, pursuant thereto, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) Parliament created the Ministry of Public Order and Safety (MPOS) to formulate and implement programs, projects, and activities relating to religious tolerance, preventing and countering violent extremism; to conduct programs, projects and activities relating to the promotion of peace and sustainable development, reconciliation, unification, and peaceful co-existence; and to implement laws, policies, programs and projects of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) concerning peace, public order, and safety;

**WHEREAS**, former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte issued Proclamation Nos. 1090 and 1091 series of 2021, both concurred in by Congress, granting amnesty to Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and MILF combatants;

**WHEREAS**, the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace, Reconciliation and Unity (OPAPRU) is already pushing for a Localized Peace Engagement (LPE), through a whole-of-nation approach, acknowledging that it is more efficient in resolving the long-standing armed revolution in the country. It also declared that OPAPRU believes that LPE is the most effective way of talking peace. Through this approach, local government units (LGUs) and members of the community can directly address the roots of the insurgency, thus preventing the communities from being exploited by the insurgents;

**WHEREAS**, the Quran declares the primacy of reconciliation in 8:61: *“If the enemy inclines towards peace, then you should also incline towards peace and trust in Allah, for He is the One that hears and knows all;”*

**WHEREAS**, cognizant of these principles, policies, and laws, the Bangsamoro Government, on its own, is also implementing various programs, such as *Kapayapaan sa Pamayanan (KAPYANAN)* and other initiatives carried out by the Ministry of Social Services and Development (MSSD), Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA), Ministry of Local Government (MILG), and other agencies;

**WHEREAS**, these various programs are intended to assist members of the MILF, and to some extent, the MNLF, who have voluntarily abandoned armed struggle and committed themselves to the peace efforts of their organization;

**WHEREAS**, most members of the armed groups in Sulu, as well as in other parts of the region, have abandoned violent extremism and voluntarily surrendered to lawful authorities;

**WHEREAS**, unfortunately, there are no available programs for these surrenderees and other former individuals involved in violent extremism, except for one-time assistance that the local government may provide upon their formal surrender;

**WHEREAS**, there is a need to further reduce or dismantle armed groups to decisively counter violent extremism or weaken their capacity to carry out acts of violence:

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, To call on the Ministry of Public Order and Safety to formulate and submit to the office of the Chief Minister a regional reintegration program for rebel returnees, and other armed groups returning to the folds of the law.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, To forward the foregoing Resolution to the MPOS for information and appropriate action.
