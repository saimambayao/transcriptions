**WHEREAS**, Section 3 of the Republic Act No. 9406 states that the Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) shall independently discharge its mandate to render, free of charge, legal representation, assistance, and counselling to indigent persons in criminal, civil, labor, administrative and other quasi-judicial cases. In the exigency of the service, the PAO may be called upon by proper government authorities to render such service to other persons, subject to existing laws, rules and regulations;”

**WHEREAS**, Section 5 of the same Act provides that the authority and responsibility for the exercise of the mandate of the PAO and for the discharge of its powers and functions shall be vested in the Chief Public Attorney;

**WHEREAS**, esteemed Dr. Persida V. Rueda-Acosta, DSD, who was appointed as the nationwide head of the PAO on February 23, 2001, by former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, is the current Chief Public Attorney;

**WHEREAS**, Chief Public Attorney Dr. Rueda-Acosta is known for her laudable commitment to the objectives of her office, which are to grant the indigent sector access to legal counsel in their time of need, and to steadfastly uphold the constitutional guarantee of free access to courts, due process, and equal protection of the laws and restore people’s faith in the judicial system;

**WHEREAS**, under the Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the “Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao”, the territorial jurisdiction of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) includes the provinces of Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, Maguindanao, and Lanao Del Sur, and the cities of Lamitan and Marawi;

**WHEREAS**, sometime in 2009, Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi were removed from the supervision of the PAO – Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), now BARMM, Regional Office and were placed under the supervision of the Zamboanga Peninsula Region (Region 9B) pursuant to the directives of Chief Public Attorney Dr. Rueda-Acosta;

**WHEREAS**, in 2015, Maguindanao was likewise removed from the supervision of the same regional office and was transferred to PAO – South Cotabato, Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, Sarangani, General Santos (SOCCSKSARGEN) region;

**WHEREAS**, only the province of Lanao del Sur remains under the supervision of the former PAO-ARMM;

**WHEREAS**, the PAO-BARMM Regional Office has been entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring that justice is accessible to all, particularly in the areas of Maguindanao and the BARMM;

**WHEREAS**, the placement of the aforementioned PAO offices outside the supervision of the PAO - BARMM hinders access to legal representation and support for its residents and impedes the agency from meeting the growing legal needs of its intended clients;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Parliament acknowledges the crucial role of the PAO, not only in providing legal services and representation to indigent litigants in the BARMM, but also in regional policy formulation;

**WHEREAS**, pursuant to the letters dated February 8, 2024, from Department of Budget and Management Secretary Amenah F. Pangandaman and Department of Justice Undersecretary Brigido J. Dulay, Deputy Chief Public Attorney Ana Lisa M.
