**WHEREAS**, Senator-elect Robin Padilla, prior to his election, has been a champion in advancing the rights and welfare of ordinary Filipinos such as the farmers and fisherfolks, the micro and small entrepreneurs, the overseas Filipino workers, the women and youth, and other vulnerable, underprivileged and marginalized sectors. He has also been consistent in the welfare and development of the Muslims and non-Muslims alike in the country through his charitable acts, quick response and relief assistance to disaster and calamity-stricken neighborhoods and families, support for the education of less fortunate children, and establishment of infrastructures and facilities essential to the communities such as cemeteries, water systems, housing, mosques, schools, and others;
