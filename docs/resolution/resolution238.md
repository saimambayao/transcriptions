**RESOLUTION NO. 238**

**RESOLUTION DIRECTING THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT TO FULLY IMPLEMENT THE SET-UP OF CITIZEN’S CHARTER AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE/COMPLAINTS DESK (PACD) IN ALL GOVERNMENT OFFICES IN BARMM**

**WHEREAS,** the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides that “The State shall maintain honesty and integrity in the public service and take positive and effective measures against graft and corruption”;

**WHEREAS,** the Bangsamoro Administrative Code distinctively defines public office as a sacred public trust. “Public officers and employees must at all times be accountable to God and to the people, serve as “khalifa”, with the utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives”;

**WHEREAS,** the same Code further stipulates that all public officers and employees shall be guided by the core values of moral governance and the Bangsamoro Civil Service Code;

**WHEREAS,** the Bangsamoro Civil Service Code specifically provides that “[P]ublic officials and employees shall perform and discharge their duties with the highest degree of excellence, professionalism, intelligence, and skill. They shall enter public service with utmost devotion and dedication to duty. They shall endeavor to discourage wrong perceptions of their roles as dispensers or peddlers of undue patronage”;

**WHEREAS,** the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act of 2018 which amended the Anti-Red Tape Act of 2007 mandates the set-up of Citizen’s Charter and the establishment of Public Assistance/Complaints Desk;

**WHEREAS,** the same law expands its application to all government offices and agencies including local government units (LGUs), government-owned or controlled corporations and other government instrumentalities, whether located in the Philippines or abroad, that provide services covering business and nonbusiness related transactions;

**WHEREAS,** its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) mandates that each agency shall establish a public assistance or complaints desk which shall set-up to, among others, effectively receive feedback and monitor customer satisfaction, in a conspicuous area at their official place of business, where an officer or employee knowledgeable in frontline services shall at all times be available for consultation and advice. The desk shall be attended to even during break time. Special lanes shall be provided for the personal transactions of senior citizens, pregnant women and persons with disabilities;

**WHEREAS,** only two (2) out of thirty-eight (38) surveyed offices in the Bangsamoro Government Center have available citizen’s charter and only six (6) out of thirty-eight (38) government offices have existing public assistance/complaints desk;

**WHEREAS,** the availability of a citizen’s charter and an officer or employee knowledgeable in frontline services in the public assistance/ complaint’s desk at all times will greatly enhance the service delivery of our government offices and lessen or prevent complaints and/or dissatisfaction.

**NOW, THEREFORE,** be it

**RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to direct the Bangsamoro Government to fully implement the set-up of Citizen’s Charter and the establishment of Public Assistance/Complaints Desk (PACD) in all government offices in BARMM.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER,** that a consolidated semestral report on the compliance of this Resolution shall be furnished to the BTA Parliament, through the Office of the Speaker, immediately after one (1) month of each semester.

**RESOLVED, FINALLY,** to forward the foregoing Resolution to all government offices in BARMM, for information and appropriate consideration.
