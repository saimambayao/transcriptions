**PARLIAMENT RESOLUTION NO. 515**

**RESOLUTION RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO REALIGN THE ORIGINAL JURISDICTION OF THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO AND ESTABLISH DISTRICT OFFICES IN EVERY PROVINCE OF THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO INCLUDING THE SPECIAL GEOGRAPHIC AREA**

**WHEREAS**, Section 2 of Republic Act No. 10867, otherwise known as *“National Bureau of Investigation Reorganization and Modernization Act”*, states that it is the policy of the State to promote and maintain an effective, modern, gender-responsive, competent, and highly trained investigative body that is functionally integrated and national in scope, and mandates the NBI to establish a regional office in every region, to be headed by a regional director, as well as district offices in every province, to be headed by a head agent.

**WHEREAS**, paragraph 2, Section 2 of the abovementioned Act provides: *“the State shall formulate plans and programs to enhance and modernize the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), with expanded structure, capability, and manpower, responsive to the demands of the times;”*

**WHEREAS**, pursuant to Department Circular No. 046 of the Department of Justice (DOJ), dated July 27, 2012, with the subject *“Assignment and Delineation of Region/District Offices of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI)”*, its office in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), now Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), was reduced to cover only the areas of Cotabato City and the Province of Maguindanao, now Maguindanao del Sur and Maguindanao del Norte, excluding the municipalities of Datu Paglas, Buluan, Pagalungan, and Datu Montawal;

**WHEREAS**, the NBI-BARMM Regional Office has been entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring the effective function and responsibility of the Bureau that could effectively be accessible to all, particularly in the city of Cotabato and provinces of Maguindanao del Norte and Maguindanao del Sur;

**WHEREAS**, exclusion of the other areas within BARMM hinders access to effective and responsive services and support for the residents of the region and impedes the Bureau from meeting the growing needs of its intended clients;

**WHEREAS**, the realignment of the jurisdiction of NBI-BARMM to its original covered areas and establishment of district offices to every province of Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, including Special Geographic Area (SGA), will help advance the full implementation of the Republic Act No. 10867;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Parliament recognizes the crucial role of NBI in providing an effective and efficient investigative body for crime investigation and resolution:

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, To respectfully request the Department of Justice to realign the original jurisdiction of the National Bureau of Investigation in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao and establish district offices in every province of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao including the Special Geographic Area.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, To forward a copy of this Resolution to the office of the Secretary of the DOJ, the National Director of the NBI, and the Intergovernmental Relations Body for their information and appropriate action.

**ADOPTED**, *Rajab* 23, 1446/January 23, 2025.
