**RESOLUTION NO. 23**

**RESOLUTION CALLING FOR THE CONSTITUTION OF AN AD HOC JOINT BODY TO DEFINE THE ZONES OF JOINT COOPERATION IN THE SULU SEA.**

**WHEREAS,** Article I of the 1987 Philippine Constitution declares that:

“The national territory comprises the Philippine archipelago, with all the islands and waters embraced therein, and all other territories over which the Philippines has sovereignty or jurisdiction, consisting of its terrestrial, fluvial, and aerial domains, including its territorial sea, the seabed, the subsoil, the insular shelves, and other submarine areas. The waters around, between, and connecting the islands of the archipelago, regardless of their breadth and dimensions, form part of the internal waters of the Philippines.”;

**WHEREAS,** pursuant to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), of which the Philippines is a signatory and a party, our country and other coastal States have been recognized to have the right to establish various maritime zones and jurisdictions over which sovereignty and appurtenant sovereign rights can be exercised. Given the premise, this proposed resolution seeks to have a general declaration and definition of the Zone of Joint Cooperation in the Sulu Sea;

**WHEREAS,** Section 18, Article XIII of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the *Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao*, provides:

**“SEC. 18. Zones of Joint Cooperation** - Zones of Joint Cooperation in the Sulu Sea and the Moro Gulf are hereby created, the coordinates of which shall be defined by an ad hoc Joint Body composed of representatives from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority, and a corresponding number of representatives from appropriate agencies of the Bangsamoro Government.

The Joint Body shall be convened within thirty (30) days after the ratification of this Organic Law and shall cease to exist after it has established the coordinates of the Bangsamoro territorial jurisdiction, including the Bangsamoro Waters and the Zones of Joint Cooperation.”

**WHEREAS,** there is a need to constitute an ad hoc Joint Body to specify the coordinates delineating the Zones of Joint Cooperation in the Sulu Sea to ensure the cooperation and coordination between the National Government and the Bangsamoro Government on the exploration, development and utilization of non-living resources in the subject Zone, and the protection of the indigenous communities’ traditional fishing grounds;

**WHEREAS,** by constituting this ad hoc Joint Body, both the Bangsamoro Government and the National Government can work together to regulate the waters therein and formulating policies for the equitable sharing of the benefits from the resources therein;

***NOW, THEREFORE, be it***

***RESOLVED,*** as it is hereby resolved, to call for the constitution of an ad hoc Joint Body to define the Zones of Joint Cooperation in the Sulu Sea.
