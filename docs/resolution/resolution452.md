**RESOLUTION CALLING FOR THE BANGSAMORO COMMISSION FOR THE PRESERVATION OF CULTURAL HERITAGE TO SPEARHEAD THE CAMPAIGN AND NOMINATE CELEBRATED TAUSUG ARTIST RAMEER AMILASAN TAWASIL FOR THE 2025 ORDER OF NATIONAL ARTISTS AWARD, THEREBY RECOGNIZING HIS SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO PHILIPPINE ARTS AND CULTURAL HERITAGE**

**WHEREAS,** the Order of National Artist (ONA) is the highest recognition for artists in the Philippines who, through their lifetime commitment, have significantly enriched the country’s cultural heritage;

**WHEREAS,** this award confers the rank and title of being a National Artist, as proclaimed by the Philippine president, which honor further celebrates artistic excellence, emphasizing the role of creative expression in shaping the nation’s cultural identity;

**WHEREAS,** in 2006, sculptor and painter Abdulmari Asia Imao achieved the distinction of being the first, and sole Muslim artist to be conferred the title of National Artist for Visual Arts, a status he will hold for life and in death;

**WHEREAS,** the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA), in partnership with the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP), recently issued a call for public nominations for new National Artist for 2025;

**WHEREAS,** Section 25, Article IX of the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao mandates that the Bangsamoro Commission for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage (BCPCH) shall have the primary responsibility to write the history of the Bangsamoro people, and to establish and sustain the cultural institutions, programs, and projects in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS,** the late Rameer Tawasil brought pride and distinction to the Bangsamoro community through his sheer dedication and commitment to his craft, which had earned him numerous accolades and recognition both here and abroad;

**WHEREAS,** his artistic prowess transcended boundaries and elevated the vibrant colors and profound narratives of the Sulu Archipelago (Sulu, Basilan, Tawi-Tawi), showcasing the abundance and resilience of the Bangsamoro culture to the world;

**WHEREAS,** the Bangsamoro Parliament had previously paid tribute to Tawasil for his extraordinary contributions to Bangsamoro culture and arts, which have been recognized and supported by institutions such as the Cultural Center of the Philippines, Vargas Museum in the University of the Philippines, NCCA Gallery, Metropolitan Museum of Manila, The Gallery of the Peninsula and the Archipelago, and various private galleries;

**WHEREAS,** his masterpieces have graced esteemed galleries in London in the United Kingdom, Kuching in Malaysia, and private collections in Germany, Korea, the United States, and the Philippines, affirming the universal appeal of and appreciation for his art;

**WHEREAS,** the demise of Rameer Tawasil in 2023 left a profound void in the artistic landscape not only in the region but also in the entire country as well, yet his enduring influence and inspirational artworks persist, shaping and motivating future generations;

**WHEREAS,** the presence of Rameer Amilasan Tawasil as an artist serves as both inspiration and a model for the Bangsamoro youth, especially those who are artistically gifted and who are enthusiastic in their pursuit of the arts, paving a new path for the young Bangsamoro to dream for a future—and carve out a future—in the creative world;

**WHEREAS,** Rameer Amilasan Tawasil not only promoted art for art’s sake but also consciously pushed positive advocacies, aiming not only to portray the realities of the Bangsamoro but also to uplift its hopes for a better, more prosperous future, exemplified by his “*peace dove*” design in 2006, which received the Peace Citation Award and became part of the international symbol of birds used in peace campaigns worldwide, with his advocacies ranging from women’s rights, environmental preservation, peace, to children’s rights, among many other things;

**WHEREAS,** the nomination of Rameer Amilasan Tawasil for National Artist for the Visual Arts will facilitate a much-needed and long-awaited departure from the biased and inaccurate portrayal of the Bangsamoro people in some aspects of Philippine society connected to its convoluted past, while his art makes tangible inroads toward a narrative that exemplifies peace and progress in the region, boosting the Bangsamoro region’s image and reputation inside and outside the country;

**WHEREAS,** undoubtedly, Rameer Amilasan Tawasil has elevated the country’s regard for art and the world’s regard for Filipino artists, thus meriting the highest recognition for his contributions to the field, not only from our Parliament but also from the national government, with this initiative to be spearheaded by the BCPCH, which holds the primary responsibility of recording and preserving the history of the Bangsamoro people:

**NOW, THEREFORE,** be it

**RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, To call for the Bangsamoro Commission for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage to spearhead the campaign and nominate celebrated Tausug artist Rameer Amilasan Tawasil for the 2025 Order of National Artist Award, thereby further recognizing his significant contributions to Philippine arts and cultural heritage.
