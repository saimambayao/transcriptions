THIRD REGULAR SESSION

RESOLUTION NO. 188

RESOLUTION SUPPORTING THE PROPOSAL OF SENATOR SHERWIN GATCHALIAN FOR THE NATIONAL ELECTRIFICATION ADMINISTRATION (NEA) TO REALLOCATE ITS FUNDING SUPPORT FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ELECTRIFICATION PROGRAM IN REMOTE VILLAGES IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION

WHEREAS, the proposal of Senator Sherwin Gatchalian for the national electrification administration to provide funding support to electrify the remote villages in BARMM is not without valid reasons. In terms of electrification, the country has achieved 95.3% coverage in 2018. However, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region has the lowest household electrification rate at 31.4% only, the lowest in the entire country;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is the main source of hydro-electric power supply in the entire Mindanao equivalent to about 662 megawatts, but it is the lowest served region in terms of the electrification program;

WHEREAS, the rural electrification program in the BARMM has been supported by its electric cooperatives such as the Lanao del Sur Electric Cooperative in the Lanao province and the Maguindanao Electric Cooperative in the Maguindanao province, respectively, however, despite the efforts of these electric cooperatives, the electrification program of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region continue to lag behind due mainly to lack of financial support or assistance from the national government. The three (3) island provinces of Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, and Basilan are the worst off-grid areas in terms of electrification;

WHEREAS, in the medium-term, Secretary Carlos Dominguez of the Department of Finance (DOF) expressed his intention to extend assistance to the BARMM in tapping funding sources for a plan to provide stable and affordable supply of electric power to BARMM provinces, as part of on-going government efforts to open livelihood opportunities, attract investments, and create more jobs in these areas. Specifically, the Department of Finance will involve private sectors and explore overseas funding from Islamic countries to implement the electrification program in the region’s remote provinces and towns:

NOW, THEREFORE, be it

RESOLVED, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to support the proposal of Senator Sherwin Gatchalian for the National Electrification Administration (NEA) to reallocate its funding support for the implementation of the electrification program in remote villages in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

RESOLVED, FURTHER, to forward this Resolution to Senator Sherwin Gatchalian, Senate President Vicente “Tito” Sotto, and National Electrification Administration, for infromation and appropriate consideration.

ADOPTED, Rabi Al-akhir 13, 1443/November 18, 2021.
