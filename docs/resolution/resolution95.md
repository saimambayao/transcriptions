**SECOND REGULAR SESSION**

**RESOLUTION NO. 95**

**RESOLUTION EXTENDING FURTHER THE PHASE-OUT PLAN FOR ACCOUNTABLE OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT UNTIL JUNE 30, 2021**

**WHEREAS**, Section 10, Article XVI of RA 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) provides that the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) shall schedule the gradual phasing out of offices of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), which are deemed abolished upon the ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law;

**WHEREAS**, Section 10, Article XVI of the Bangsamoro Organic Law also provides that in consideration of public interest and delivery of services, officials holding appointive positions shall continue to perform their functions in accordance with the phase-out schedule;

**WHEREAS**, the BTA Parliament approved Resolution No. 75 dated June 25, 2020, resolving to extend the Phase-Out Plan for accountable officials and employees of the former ARMM until December 31, 2020 or unless sooner replaced with the settlement of accountability reports and physical accomplishment, whichever comes first;

**WHEREAS**, alongside the declaration of Pandemic throughout the Philippines, local government units have enforced “Enhanced Community Quarantine” within their areas of responsibility making it impossible, for the time being, to continue the scheduled hiring process of the Bangsamoro Government;

**WHEREAS**, the extended phase-out period of accountable officials is considered an amendment of the Bangsamoro Transition Plan which similarly requires the majority vote of all the members of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority under Section 6, Article XVI of the RA 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law;

**WHEREAS**, considering the considerable number of deliverables still pending completion by the accountable officers and technical support staff having worked only with a skeleton workforce during the period of community quarantine, the further extension of the phase-out period of select officials up to December 31, 2020 was determined to be necessary by the Parliament;

**WHEREAS**, the recent enactment of the Bangsamoro Administrative Code notwithstanding, accountable officials and employees in the Bangsamoro Government cannot be easily replaced with new hires in view of the length of time it takes to complete the hiring process;

**WHEREAS**, the same is true for the Bangsamoro Parliament whose organizational structure is yet to be finalized and approved;

**WHEREAS**, in the exigency of public service and in order not to paralyze the flow of transaction of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, the said accountable officers and employees of the BTA shall be extended for another 6 months which shall be up to June 30, 2021;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to extend further the phase-out plan for accountable officers and employees of the Bangsamoro Government until June 30, 2021, unless sooner replaced with the settlement of accountability reports and physical accomplishment, whichever comes first.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, that the said accountable officials through the head of their ministries, agencies and offices shall submit accountability reports to the Bangsamoro Parliament before the end of their term.

**RESOLVED, FURTHERMORE**, that the relevant Offices in the executive shall submit the recommended list of officers and personnel for extension to the Office of the Chief Minister, and the relevant Divisions in the Parliament to the Office of the Speaker, on or before 31 December 2020.

**RESOLVED, FURTHERMORE**, that the list of officers and personnel to be extended shall be subject to the review and approval of the Chief Minister for executive offices, and the Speaker for legislative offices.

**RESOLVED, FURTHERMORE**, that the officers and personnel to be extended shall continue to perform in their current capacities unless their appointments are sooner revoked, resignations accepted, replacements appointed, or new appointments issued under the approved staffing pattern in their respective divisions.

**RESOLVED, FURTHERMORE**, that the payment for the salaries and wages of the extended personnel shall be charged to Miscellaneous Personnel Benefits Fund as provided in the FY 2021 Bangsamoro Appropriations Act.

**RESOLVED, FURTHERMORE**, that notwithstanding the extension of the phase-out plan, the BTA shall continue the conduct of their hiring processes while taking into account the safety of all concerned by observing all the health security protocols and social distancing measures.

**RESOLVED, FINALLY**, that the Office of the Chief Minister for the executive, and the Office of the Speaker for the Parliament, shall be authorized to promulgate guidelines necessary to carry out this resolution.

**ADOPTED**, December 16, 2020.
