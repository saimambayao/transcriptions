**SECOND REGULAR SESSION**

**RESOLUTION NO. 120**

**RESOLUTION REQUESTING THE OFFICE OF THE HONORABLE CHIEF MINISTER TO AUTHORIZE THE GRANT OF RAMADHAN ALLOWANCE TO ALL PERSONNEL AND EMPLOYEES OF THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM)**

**WHEREAS,** it is paramount that the Bangsamoro Government must recognize the customs and traditions of all people in the region and the indispensability of these customs and traditions in forging the unity of the constituents and pursuing the wholistic development of the region;

**WHEREAS,** Ramadhan is the Ninth (9) month of the Islamic lunar calendar where Muslims observe a month-long fasting, reflection, and prayers. It is in the month of Ramadan that Muslims all over the world commemorate the first revelation of Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) and fasting in this month is obligatory for all Muslims as it is considered one of the five pillars of Islam;

**WHEREAS,** with the establishment of the Bangsamoro Region, through the enactment of RA 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law, the region can now promulgate actions which are more culturally appropriate and responsive to the needs of the people;

**WHEREAS,** Ramadan is an equally significant occasion celebrated globally – similar to that of the Christmas day where all government and private employees are given the 13th month pay equivalent to one (1) month basic salary pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 852;

**WHEREAS,** providing Ramadan allowance to all personnel and employees of the BARMM is one way to motivate them to work harder and be more productive even in the difficult time of the month-long fasting and dusk-to-dawn prayers;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to request the Office of the Honorable Chief Minister Ahod B. Ebrahim to authorize the grant of Ramadhan allowance sourced from any available funds of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority for all personnel and employees of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).

**RESOLVED, FURTHER,** that the Office of the Chief Minister shall promulgate the qualifications of eligible for the said allowance, but shall include in the grant, contractual employees and job orders.

**RESOLVED, FINALLY,** that a copy of this Resolution be furnished the Office of the Chief Minister and Ministry of Finance, Budget and Management for immediate action.

**ADOPTED,** March 25, 2021.
