**RESOLUTION URGING THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY (GOTD) TO ESTABLISH A BANGSAMORO COMPLAINT CENTER AND HOTLINE, THEREBY LOCALIZING THE EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 06 S. 2016, AS PART OF THE GRIEVANCE MECHANISM OF THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT**

**WHEREAS**, Section 27, Article II of the Constitution provides that the State shall maintain honesty and integrity in the public service and shall take positive and effective measures against graft and corruption;

**WHEREAS**, Section 8, Article IX of the Republic Act No. 11054 states that the Bangsamoro Government shall provide, maintain, and ensure the delivery of basic and responsive health programs, quality education, appropriate services, livelihood opportunities, affordable and progressive housing projects, power and electricity, and water for the inhabitants of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Organic Law further provides that all public officers and employees of the Bangsamoro Government shall at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives;

**WHEREAS**, Republic Act 9485, or the Anti-Red Tape Act of 2007, states that the State shall take appropriate measures to promote transparency in each agency with regard to the manner of transacting with the public, with the objective of reducing red tape and expediting transactions in government;

**WHEREAS**, by virtue of R.A. No. 9485, the Civil Service Commission (CSC) established the Contact Center ng Bayan (CCB) which serves as a public accountability mechanism among government agencies by providing citizens with various legitimate channels and platforms to report feedback on government frontline services;

**WHEREAS**, recognizing the need to institutionalize this feedback mechanism and build on existing government processes to further eradicate red tape and corruption, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte issued Executive Order No. 6 on October 14, 2016, establishing the *8888 Citizens’ Complaint Center*;

**WHEREAS**, through the 8888 Complaint Hotline, people are given the opportunity to directly bring complaints on their issues and concerns in the way the government agencies perform their mandates and functions, and deliver basic services to the people;

**WHEREAS**, based on the Contact Center ng Bayan (CCB) 2020 year-end report on data of hotline 8888, from January to December 2020, hotline 8888 has endorsed 95 tickets to the CSC thru the 8888 portal. The CSC posted a 100.00% resolution rate for acting on the tickets referred by Hotline 8888. A total of 58, or 61.05%, of the citizens’ concerns were complaints against government agencies/employees and on government regulations/processes/services; 17, or 17.89%, were concerns regarding employment in the government; eight (8), or 8.42%, were follow-ups on pending cases; seven (7), or 7.37%, were appreciations and commendations; three (3), or 3.16%, were concerns on benefit claims; while the remaining two (2), or 2.11%, were concerns on the processing of clearances;

**WHEREAS**, considering the new setup of bureaucracy and form of government in the transparency and accountability in all BARMM offices, agencies, and instrumentalities through the establishment of a regional public citizens’ hotline;

**WHEREAS**, the creation of this regional feedback mechanism will provide all individuals residing within the Bangsamoro region an inclusive and proper avenue through which they can communicate their observations and timely delivery of public services, especially from those employed in government frontline services, including possible issues and concerns on the delivery of these services and potential corruption practices that ministries, offices, and LGUs should act upon;

**WHEREAS**, there is still no devoted hotline or mobile number in the Bangsamoro Government through which Bangsamoro constituents can bring their observations or grievances, if any, to the concerned BARMM ministries, offices, and LGUs. This citizens’ feedback mechanism could help the Bangsamoro Government in improving the performance of its mandates and functions and the delivery of its services to its constituents;

**WHEREAS**, a Bangsamoro Citizen's Hotline is also an effective strategy and mechanism for performance monitoring and evaluation of the service delivery of the different ministries and offices, including LGUs in the Bangsamoro region:

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Parliament Authority, to urge the Government of the day (GOTD) to establish a Bangsamoro Complaint Center and Hotline, thereby localizing the Executive Order No. 06 s. 2016, as part of grievance mechanism of the Bangsamoro Government.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, to forward the foregoing Resolution to the Honorable Chief Minister Hon. Ahod B. Ebrahim, for information and appropriate consideration.
