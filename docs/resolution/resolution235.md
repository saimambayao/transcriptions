> “While women are considered as peace promoters, they can also play various roles in conflict. According to studies, it has become progressively clear over the past decades that women across the globe may change the forces of war, act as combatants, as social political back-ups, or serve through a symbolic role as “mothers of the nation” who sacrifice their children to armed struggle (p. 27).”
