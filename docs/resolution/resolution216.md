**RESOLUTION RESPECTFULLY APPEALING TO HIS EXCELLENCY PRESIDENT RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE TO SIGN INTO LAW SENATE BILL NO. 2420 AND HOUSE BILL NO. 9925, OR THE MARAWI SIEGE VICTIMS COMPENSATION ACT**

**WHEREAS**, Section 17, Article XIV of the Constitution of the Philippines provides that “the State shall recognize, respect and protect the rights of indigenous cultural communities to preserve and develop their cultures, traditions, and institutions. It shall consider the rights in the formulation of national plans and policies”;

**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Article IV of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 11054 or the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao provides that “in the exercise of its right to self-governance, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is free to pursue its political, economic, social, and cultural development as provided for in this Organic Law.”;

**WHEREAS**, Section 8, Article IX of R.A. No. 11054 provides that “the Bangsamoro Government shall provide, maintain, and ensure the delivery of basic and responsive health programs, quality education, appropriate services, livelihood opportunities, affordable and progressive housing projects, power and electricity, and water supply, among others, to the Bangsamoro people and other inhabitants of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. It shall maintain appropriate disaster-preparedness units for immediate and effective relief services to victims of natural and man-made calamities. It shall also ensure the rehabilitation of calamity-affected areas and victims of calamities.”;

**WHEREAS**, Section 1, Article XIV of the same law provides that “the Bangsamoro Government, with funding support from the National Government, shall intensify development efforts for the rehabilitation, reconstruction, and development of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region as part of the normalization process. . . and address the needs of internally displaced persons, widows and orphans, and poverty-stricken communities.”;

**WHEREAS**, due to the siege in 2017, a man-made calamity, which brought a five-month battle between government forces and terrorist groups in Marawi City, most if not all of the inhabitants of the said city, especially in the Most Affected Areas (MAA), had their private properties lost or destroyed, apart from them becoming Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) from the time of the onset of the siege up to this moment for some of them. This is due to the rehabilitation programs which are still in progress presently;

**WHEREAS**, the IDPs are still hoping and waiting to receive compensation from the National Government for the said loss and destruction of their private properties. This is not only to rebuild the properties that they lost, but also their lives as well for a new beginning;

**WHEREAS**, since 2018, there were already several bills on Marawi rehabilitation filed in Congress, but only House Bill No. 9925 and Senate Bill No. 2240 were approved on third and final reading in the respective houses;

**WHEREAS**, the said bills are awaiting approval into law by the President.

**WHEREAS**, the signing of this bill shall serve as the greatest help that will be received by the victims of the said armed conflict. This noble action will make them feel how the Government of the Philippines values them as part of the Nation:

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, To respectfully appeal to His Excellency President Rodrigo Roa Duterte to sign Senate Bill No. 2240 and House Bill No. 9945, or the Marawi Siege Victims Compensation Act.
