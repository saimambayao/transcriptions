**RESOLUTION NO. 14**

**SUPPORTING THE PEOPLE’S CALL FOR THE SWIFT PASSAGE OF A COMPENSATION LAW THAT WILL BENEFIT THE VICTIMS OF THE SEPARATE ARMED ENCOUNTERS IN BUTIG, PIAGAPO, AND MARAWI CITY, ALL IN THE PROVINCE OF LANAO DEL SUR, AND RESPECTFULLY APPEALING TO THE NATIONAL CONGRESS TO GIVE DUE CONSIDERATION AND ATTENTION TO BILLS FILED AND YET TO BE FILED IN RELATION THERETO.**

**WHEREAS**, it has been more than two years, beginning on May 2017, when armed elements composed of the Maute Group, Abu Sayyaf Group, and others inspired by the global terrorist group Dawlah Islamiyah or Daesh, attempted to take over the city of Marawi that led to a months-long battle with the security forces of the Philippines in what is now infamously known as the “Marawi siege”;

**WHEREAS**, this was preceded by similarly destructive armed encounters in Butig, Lanao del Sur in November 2016 and Piagapo, Lanao del Sur on January 2017;

**WHEREAS**, these incidents resulted in massive devastation on the part of the residents in terms of, among others, private and commercial property destructions, interruption and, in some instances, dearth of economic opportunities, and continued inability to return to normalcy;

**WHEREAS**, both Houses of Congress saw the filing of multiple bills seeking the payment of compensation to those who suffered from the Marawi siege;

**WHEREAS**, these bills did not reach farther than the Committee Stage, when the 17th Congress finally adjourned to give way to the midterm elections;

**WHEREAS**, none of these bills tackle the similarly-situated residents of Butig and Piagapo;

**WHEREAS**, in the meantime, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao and its interim government, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority have been duly constituted by the passage and due ratification of R.A. No. 11054 or the Organic Law for the BARMM;

**WHEREAS**, while the enactment of a legislation for compensation remains within the exclusive province of the National Congress, the BTA is duty-bound to represent the interest and advocate for the general welfare of its constituents, including those embodied in Article IV, Section 7, which states that “[t]he Bangsamoro Government shall ensure that every Filipino citizen in its territorial jurisdiction is provided the basic necessities and equal opportunities in life. Social justice shall be promoted in all aspects of life and phases of development in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;”

**WHEREAS**, the losses suffered by the residents of Butig, Piagapo, and Marawi City prevent them from accessing basic necessities and taking advantage of available opportunities being as they are left to rebuild their lives from scratch and on their own;

**WHEREAS**, a law that mandates the payment of compensation is a resounding clamor heard from the innermost corners of these affected localities who consider it a critical ingredient to jumpstart their return to peaceful and productive lives;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to support the public’s call for the immediate enactment of a compensation law that redounds to the benefit of those victimized by the armed encounters in Butig, Piagapo, and Marawi City;

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, to respectfully ask the National Congress to heed this clamor and with all promptness, act on the relevant bills as soon as they are filed, in recognition of the urgency of the need for such compensation by the victims;

**RESOLVED FINALLY**, that a copy of this Resolution be furnished the Senate through the Office of the Senate President, the House of Representatives through the Office of Speaker of the House, and the Office of the Chief Minister.

**Adopted, June 26, 2019.**
