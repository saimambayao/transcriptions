**WHEREAS,** Section 4 of Republic Act No. 1387, also known as “*An Act Providing for the Establishment of the University of Mindanao in Dansalan City and Authorizing the Appropriation of Funds Therefor*”, as amended, provides that, “*The government of said University is vested in a board of regents to be known as the Board of Regents of the Mindanao State University (MSU);*”

**WHEREAS,** Memorandum No. 45, S. 1986, also known as “*Modifying Republic Act No. 1387, as Amended*”, provides that, “*The Board of Regents shall consist of fifteen (15) members to be composed of eleven (11) ex-officio members to wit: The Minister of Education, Culture and Sports, the Minister of the Budget, the Director- General of the National Economic and Development Authority, the Chairman of the Lupong Tagapagpaganap, the President of the University, the Chancellors of the MSU Iligan Institute of Technology, the MSU General Santos College and the MSU Tawi-Tawi College, and the elected Presidents of the MSU National Alumni Association, the MSU Faculty Federation and the MSU Student Councils, and four (4) members to be appointed by the President of the Philippines, three (3) of whom shall be chosen from the cultural communities and one (1) who is a nationally prominent educator;*”

**WHEREAS,** House Bill No. 969, entitled “*An Act Strengthening the MSU System and Appropriating Funds Therefor*”, was filed by the Honorable Congressman Rufus B. Rodriguez on July 1, 2022;

**WHEREAS,** Section 12 of the aforementioned bill provides that, “*The governing body of the MSU shall be the Board of Regents, hereinafter referred to as the Board, which shall be chaired and co-chaired by the Chairperson of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the President of the MSU, respectively, and with the following as members: ...(h) one (1) Chancellor Regent representing all Chancellors of the MSU system campuses, as member, who shall be elected from among themselves and shall have a term of one (1) year... ;*”

**WHEREAS,** the said bill, in effect, intends to remove the three (3) Chancellor-Regents of MSU - Iligan Institute of Technology, MSU - General Santos College, and the MSU - Tawi-Tawi College of Technology and Oceanography from membership in the Board of Regents and replace them with a one (1) Chancellor-Regent representing all Chancellors of the MSU System;

**WHEREAS,** the current membership of the Board of Regents, which includes three (3) Chancellor-Regents, has been effective in ensuring the representation and participation of all constituent university campuses in the decision-making process of the MSU System;

**WHEREAS,** the presence of the three (3) Chancellor-Regents from IIT, TCTO, and GSC is vital for effective consultation and diverse representation of the MSU system.

**WHEREAS,** the proposed membership of the Board of Regents in House Bill No. 969 represents identifiable stakeholders with similar concerns across the system, whereas the current membership, with the three (3) Chancellor-Regents represent broader and more diverse constituencies:
