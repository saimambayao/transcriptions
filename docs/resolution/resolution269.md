**RESOLUTION NO. 269**

**RESOLUTION COMMENDING AND EXTENDING PROFOUND GRATITUDE TO HIS EXCELLENCY PRESIDENT FERDINAND “BONGBONG” ROMUALDEZ MARCOS JR. FOR HONORING AND SUSTAINING THE GAINS OF PEACE AGREEMENTS WHICH LED TO THE UNPRECEDENTED UNIFICATION OF THE MORO FRONTS IN THE COUNTRY**

**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Article XVI of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the “Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao” states that the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) shall be the interim government in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region during the transition period. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) shall lead the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, without prejudice to the participation of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) in its membership;

**WHEREAS**, in October of 2021, R.A. No. 11593, otherwise known as “An Act Resetting the First Regular Elections in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM)” was signed into law by then President Rodrigo Duterte. Section 1 of the said law amended Section 13, Article XVI of Republic Act No. 11054, thereby postponing the first regular elections in the BARMM and synchronizing it with the 2025 national elections;

**WHEREAS**, under Section 2 of R.A. No. 11593, it is stated that during the extension of the transition period, the BTA shall continue as the interim government of the BARMM; *Provided, however,* That the President may appoint the eighty (80) new interim members of the BTA who shall serve up to June 30, 2025, or until their successors shall have been elected and qualified;

**WHEREAS**, on June 30, 2022, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. took his oath as the 17th President of the Republic of the Philippines;

**WHEREAS**, on August 12, 2022, President Marcos Jr. administered the oath to the eighty (80) newly and re-appointed members of the BTA representing the MILF, MNLF, and various sectors from the Government of the Philippines (GPH);

**WHEREAS**, President Marcos Jr. appointed the BTA members only more than a month after his inauguration, a sign of his commitment and prioritization of the BARMM and the welfare of the Bangsamoro. In fact, the United Nations (UN) lauded President Marcos Jr. for his prompt appointment of the BTA Members. UN Resident Coordinator of the United Nations and Humanitarian Coordinator in the Philippines Gustavo Gonzalez said in a statement that "*the United Nations welcomes the President’s prompt appointment of the BTA members, which indicates his prioritization of the peace process and its successful implementation*”;

**WHEREAS**, all of this is in accordance with the implementation of the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB) which was signed in 2014, the culmination of 17 years’ worth of peace negotiations between the MILF and the GPH, through R.A. No. 11054;

**WHEREAS**, forty-one (41) members of the BTA were nominated by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, while the rest were endorsed by the Philippine Government, some of whom are aligned with MNLF founding chairman Nur Misuari;

**WHEREAS**, with the new BTA, the MNLF and MILF have been finally united under one Bangsamoro Autonomous Government;

**WHEREAS**, the MNLF’s participation, particularly under the leadership of Misuari, is a product of the “convergence effort” of the Office of the Presidential Adviser on Peace, Reconciliation and Unity (OPAPRU) to harmonize the Bangsamoro peace agreements, including the 1976 Tripoli deal, the 1996 final peace agreements and the 2014 Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro. This is the first time that the MILF and the MNLF will be working together. President Marcos expressed confidence that with the unification of the MILF and MNLF, forging a "good" pact would help BARMM attain the goal of bringing "progress for our people”;

**WHEREAS**, President Marcos Jr. emphasized the need to provide a voice to all of the stakeholders and the parties involved. The president said that they did their absolute best in making sure that the representation that was filed in the Transition Authority would be "as fair as it has to be”. He foresees that the contributions and peace that will emanate from BARMM will “finally fulfill the promise of the promised land that we have been hoping for so very, very long”;

**WHEREAS**, the UN, through its Humanitarian Coordinator Gonzalez, notes that the new composition of the BTA "*is expected to allow for a smooth transition process and continuity of BTA programs, projects, and legislative measures on the one hand.*" The UN sees that there is a "*greater inclusivity*" in the composition, as all of the MILF and MNLF factions and the diverse communities of the BARMM are represented for the first time. Moreover, the new composition also allows for more qualified women to be in the BTA. Thus, the President’s call for unity is all the more reinforced;

**WHEREAS**, in conformity with the ideals and aspirations of the interim Chief Minister Ahod Balawag Ebrahim towards one United Bangsamoro, Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., the Presidential Adviser on Peace, Reconciliation, and Unity, said during the oath-taking of the eighty (80) BTA members that "*with the joining of the MNLF and the MILF, and with the 'balanced' and fair or equitable composition of the 39 GPH nominees, this is now no longer just the BTA of the old BARMM but the BTA of a 'United BARMM'*”;

**WHEREAS**, the BTA is extending its profound gratitude to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. for making the Bangsamoro peace process a priority and for pursuing peace-building initiatives in the country;

**WHEREAS**, the BTA likewise extends its gratitude and appreciation to Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. for his unwavering commitment, dedication, and hard work in the peace process:

**NOW, THEREFORE,** be it

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, To commend and extend profound gratitude to his excellency President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Romualdez Marcos Jr. for honoring and sustaining the gains of peace agreements which led to the unprecedented unification of the Moro fronts in the country.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER,** to present the foregoing Resolution to His Excellency Ferdinand R, Marcos, Jr., President of the Republic of the Philippines, for information.

**ADOPTED,** Safar 26, 1444/September 22, 2022.
