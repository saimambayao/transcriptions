This also includes the setting up of office and other institutions necessary for the continued functioning of government and delivery of social services in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, as well as those necessary for the smooth operations of the first elected Bangsamoro Government in 2022;”*

**WHEREAS**, the BTA, as the interim government of BARMM, plays a crucial role and has been an instrument for ensuring an inclusive, beneficial, transparent, and effective transition process, as well as the smooth implementation of the provisions of Republic Act No. 11054 before the end of the transition period;

**WHEREAS**, to date, the BTA Parliament has passed the Bangsamoro Administrative Code on October 28, 2020, the Bangsamoro Civil Service Code on February 24, 2021, the Bangsamoro Education Code on May 18, 2021, the Bangsamoro Electoral Code on March 8, 2023, and the Bangsamoro Local Governance Code on September 28, 2023, demonstrating its commitment to fulfilling its legislative mandate during the transition period, and has organized its regional bureaucracy accordingly;

**WHEREAS**, in the recent ruling of the Supreme Court in the case, *“Province of Sulu, et. Al. v. Medialdea, et. AL.,”* with General Register Nos. 242255, 243246, and 243693, promulgated on September 9, 2024, the Court upheld the validity of Republic Act No. 11054 but declared that the Province of Sulu as not part of BARMM, as the province had rejected the law’s ratification;

**WHEREAS**, the exclusion of the province of Sulu from BARMM, following the ruling of the Supreme Court, has created uncertainties in the provisions of already enacted Bangsamoro Autonomy Acts by the BTA, leading to ambiguity in key aspects of the upcoming BARMM parliamentary elections, including the composition of the Bangsamoro Parliament, the allocation of parliamentary district seats, voting and candidacy rights, and representation, among others;

**WHEREAS**, in an interview on September 16, 2024, Ray Sumalipao, the Director of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) for BARMM, stated that the BTA must decide the fate of the seven (7) parliamentary seats previously reserved for the province of Sulu;

**WHEREAS**, lawyer and human rights advocate Algamar Latiph, through his counsel, has filed a motion for reconsideration before the Supreme Court on its decision to exclude Sulu province from BARMM;

**WHEREAS**, a petition is currently pending before the Supreme Court under General Register No. 267368, challenging the Bangsamoro Electoral Code of 2023, which governs the electoral system within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS**, the Supreme Court requires sufficient time to thoroughly review and deliberate on the petition challenging the Bangsamoro Electoral Code and the motion for reconsideration submitted in connection with the Sulu case;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Electoral Code is a novel, distinct, and complex piece of legislation, particularly due to its application within an autonomous regional parliamentary framework operating under a national presidential system;

**WHEREAS**, as of July 02, 2024, sixteen (16) political parties and one thousand five hundred (1,500) sectoral organizations have sought registration with the COMELEC following the enactment of the Bangsamoro Electoral Code in March 2023;

**WHEREAS**, as of October 02, 2024, out of sixteen (16) political parties, only three (3) have been accredited by the COMELEC: 1) United Bangsamoro Justice Party (UBJP), 2) Al-Ittihad Mindanawe Darussalam–Ungaya Ku Kawagibu Bangsamoro (Al Ittihad UKB) Party, and 3) BARMM Grand Coalition (BGC);

**WHEREAS**, given the unique, complex, and novel nature of the Bangsamoro Electoral Code, along with the systems and processes it entails, the COMELEC requires additional time to adequately prepare for the Parliamentary elections, in addition to the national and local elections;

**WHEREAS**, a recent survey conducted by the Institute for Autonomy and Governance (IAG) highlights the significant challenges and a limited understanding among the Bangsamoro electorate regarding the upcoming parliamentary elections, with the majority of likely voters in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region indicating they have little to no knowledge of the new voting system and the unique features of the region’s first-ever parliamentary elections in 2025;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro electorate must be given adequate time and opportunity to familiarize themselves with and fully comprehend the new parliamentary elections within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS**, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the economic performance of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region surged by four point three percent (4.3%) in 2023, reflecting an estimated Eleven Billion Nine Hundred Million Pesos (₱11.9B) increase in the region’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP);

**WHEREAS**, recent data from the PSA reveals that, despite having the highest poverty incidence in Mindanao, BARMM achieved an almost thirty percent (30%) poverty incidence reduction rate, decreasing from fifty-two point six percent (52.6%) in 2018 to twenty-three point five percent (23.5%) in 2023, an improvement attributed to the initiatives of the Bangsamoro Government and the collaborative efforts of stakeholders in promoting peace and development in the region;

**WHEREAS**, the transition period plays a crucial role in ensuring the smooth establishment of BARMM as an autonomous political entity, with enhanced self-governance and jurisdiction over the Bangsamoro region, free from legal impediments;

**WHEREAS**, it is imperative to ensure that political parties, duty bearers, and the Bangsamoro electorate are prepared for the first regular Parliamentary elections:

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, To respectfully request the House of Representatives and the Senate of the Philippines to further extend the transition period from 2025 to 2028, thereby postponing the first regular Parliamentary elections in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region to allow sufficient time to resolve legal issues affecting the Parliamentary elections, ensure broader participation of political parties and a full understanding by the Bangsamoro electorate of the new parliamentary elections, and enable the Bangsamoro Government to sustain the momentum of socio-economic progress in the region.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, To furnish this Resolution to the House of Representatives, the Senate of the Philippines, and the Commission on Elections, for their information and appropriate action.
