**RESOLUTION CONDEMNING IN THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE SENSE THE TRAGIC DEATH OF EZELL A. TAN, AND REQUESTING THE APPROPRIATE AGENCIES OF THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT TO EXPEDITE THE CONDUCT OF THEIR INVESTIGATION IN ORDER TO SERVE JUSTICE TO THE BEREAVED FAMILY OF THE DECEASED**

**WHEREAS**, Section 5, Article II of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides that, *“The maintenance of peace and order, the protection of life, liberty, and property, and the promotion of the general welfare are essential for the enjoyment by all the people of the blessing of democracy”*;

**WHEREAS**, Section 11, Article II of the same declares, *"The State values the dignity of every human person and guarantees the full respect for human rights"*;

**WHEREAS**, Section 1, Article III of the Bill of Rights states that *“No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of laws”*;

**WHEREAS**, Section 6 of Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054, also known as *“Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao”* states that *“The Bangsamoro Government shall fully respect human rights”*;

**WHEREAS**, a fisherman came across a floating cadaver along the coast of Barangay Molimoc, Balabagan, Lanao del Sur on July 20, 2023, at twilight. The fisherman allegedly reported the incident to the Barangay officials, which was then referred to the Municipal Police Station;

**WHEREAS**, according to Balabagan, Lanao del Sur Municipal Chief of Police, Police Major (P/MAJ) Michael Yap, the lifeless body was determined to be Ezell A. Tan after being confirmed by the latter’s family;

**WHEREAS**, P/MAJ Yap believes that the deceased Ezell has been brutally abused before his life was taken as there were marks on his head and body that were swollen and other indications of possible torture;

**WHEREAS**, according to Cotabato City Police Station 2, under the leadership of Station Commander P/MAJ John Vincent F. Bravo, Ezell A. Tan has been reported missing since July 18, 2023, together with one (1) multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) Toyota Avanza with license plate LGX 113 which was allegedly owned by the deceased Ezell;

**WHEREAS**, Ezell A. Tan is a male, 34-year-old, resident of Rosary Heights V, Cotabato City, a Philippine Navy Reservist, and is currently employed at Commission on Population and Development XII as Accountant II;

**WHEREAS**, the brutal killing of Mr. Tan is not the first of its kind. This killing is the latest incident to fall under the unexplained and senseless series of killings in the Bangsamoro Region;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro government is committed to protect its constituents against threat to security and safety that will hinder the progressive development and maintenance of peace and order in the region. Additionally, the act made by the perpetrators behind Mr. Tan’s death is unlawful and against human rights which the Philippines strongly condemns:

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, To condemn in the strongest possible sense the tragic death of Ezell A. Tan, and request the appropriate agencies of the Bangsamoro Government to expedite the conduct of their investigation in order to serve justice to the bereaved family of the deceased.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, That a copy of this Resolution be furnished to the bereaved family of Ezell A. Tan and appropriate agencies, for information.

**ADOPTED**, Muharram 28, 1445/August 15, 2023.
