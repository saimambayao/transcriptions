WHEREAS, Republic Act No. 11054 otherwise known as the “Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao” states that:

Section 3, Article V, General Welfare - The Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective government and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants;

Section 22, Article IX, Comprehensive and Integrated Health Service Delivery. - The Bangsamoro Government shall adopt a policy on health that provides for a comprehensive and integrated health service delivery for its constituents. It shall establish by law a general hospital system to serve the health requirements of its people and ensure that the individual basic right to life shall be attainable through the prompt intervention of excellent and affordable medical services;

The Bangsamoro Government shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. It shall also uphold the peoples' right to have access to essential goods, health, and other social services that promote their well-being;

WHEREAS, Section 2, Chapter 1, Title V of the Bangsamoro Administrative Code provides that the MOH shall be primarily responsible for the formulation, planning, implementation and coordination of policies and programs for health. It shall promote, protect, preserve, and restore the health of the people through the provision and delivery of health services through regulation and encouragement of providers of health goods and services;

WHEREAS, as the public health is of utmost importance, related service activities should be focused on preserving, promoting and advancing health that includes treatment and management of diseases. The MOH is cognizant that one of its priority objectives is to provide basic health services to the residents of the BARMM;

WHEREAS, hospital care as part of the curative aspect of health management requires logistical support as its component including medicines, supplies, and adjuncts to essential hospital intervention like oxygen provision and supply;

WHEREAS, an oxygen support is an essential component of medical management among patients in the hospital. In almost all critically managed patients, oxygen supplementation as life support via inhalation is routinely ordered in almost all moderate to severe respiratory, post-operative recovery, and all patients having difficulty of breathing;

WHEREAS, in most advanced cities and even isolated areas all over the world, local oxygen generation is the trend for hospital upgrades and improvements making oxygen supply stable, independent, and predictable to our hospitals and clinics;

WHEREAS, majority of hospitals in BARMM are located in Geographically Isolated Disadvantaged Areas (GIDA). Not a single hospital capacity to locally produce oxygen, so that the need for a secure and constant source of high-quality medical grade oxygen is necessary, considering primarily those produced directly at the hospital site, and ready to use when needed;

WHEREAS, during the pandemic, the travel restrictions imposed worsened the difficulties in the supply chain from procurement, delivery, transfers, and utilization rendering management among critical patients very challenging;

WHEREAS, supply of pressure-filled oxygen tanks is dependent on suppliers from Zamboanga City for the island provinces of Basilan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi, while Maguindanao Province receives it from Cotabato or General Santos City, while Cagayan de Oro City supplies for Lanao del Sur that entails great length of travel distance that is often affected by road, weather or sea conditions (for island provinces) and even by unstable peace and security;

WHEREAS, the need to conduct a feasibility study by the MOH to procure and acquire a low-cost, high-efficiency, minimal maintenance and user-friendly oxygen generators is urgent from the hospital management perspective:

NOW, THEREFORE, be it

RESOLVED, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, To urge the Bangsamoro Government through the Ministry of Health to conduct a feasibility study to procure and acquire low-cost high efficient oxygen generators among the twenty-seven (27) hospitals of the BARMM.

RESOLVED FURTHER, That this Resolution be forwarded to the Ministry of Health, for information.
