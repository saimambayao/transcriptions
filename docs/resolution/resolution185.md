RESOLUTION NO. 185

RESOLUTION DIRECTING THE MINISTRIES AND OFFICES OF THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT TO FORMULATE AND IMPLEMENT THEIR RESPECTIVE CAREER AND HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT PLANS TOWARDS BUILDING AN EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT BANGSAMORO BUREAUCRACY

WHEREAS, Article 20, Chapter 3, Book I of the Bangsamoro Civil Service Code (BCSC) provides that “each agency shall prepare a career and personnel development plan. Such career and personnel development plan shall include provisions on merit promotions, performance evaluation, in-service training, including overseas and local scholarships and training grants, job rotation, suggestions and incentive award systems, and such other provisions for employees’ health, welfare, counselling, recreation and similar services”;

WHEREAS, Section 2, Article III of Republic Act 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) provides for the effective use of economic resources for human development, among others;

WHEREAS, Section 2, item (xx), Article V of the BOL provides the powers of the Bangsamoro Government on technical cooperation for human resource development;

WHEREAS, Section 47, Title III, Book IV of the Bangsamoro Administrative Code provides that the Development Academy of the Bangsamoro (DAB) shall be the central human capital development training and research arm of the Bangsamoro Government for its agencies and employees;

WHEREAS, the newly established Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) requires a strong institutional structure and professionalized bureaucracy particularly its new ministries and agencies with different sectoral concerns;

WHEREAS, the manpower complements of the current BARMM are a combination of old and new staff and personnel resulting from the abolition of the ARMM, where some of its employees were given the opportunity to join and become new entrants to the BARMM bureaucracy;

WHEREAS, in light of the aforementioned, there is a need to continuously build the human resource complement of the agencies and institutions of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region from the regional down to the local level, where frontline services happen;

WHEREAS, it is thus appropriate and logical to formulate and implement a Human Resource Development Plan (HRDP) to ensure the quality of the human capacity of the autonomous region’s staff and personnel;

WHEREAS, the formulation process should begin with Training Needs Assessments (TNAs) to ensure that the HRD Program of every agency is demand-driven rather than supply-driven. The Civil Service Commission (CSC) has specific guidelines in the preparation of TNAs and should be used for the purpose;

WHEREAS, the ministries and offices shall work closely with the CSC and DAB for the preparation of their respective Human Resource Development Plan;

WHEREAS, upon completion of the TNAs, the formulation of the Human Resource Development Plan shall begin anchored on trainings and capacity building activities and should be based on major sectoral concerns, such as economic, social, infrastructure, governance, and development administration concerns;

WHEREAS, the Human Resource Development Plan should have a three-year time frame to coincide with the three-year term of the new mandate of the BARMM (2022-2025). In the meantime, the on-going training and capacity building activities of the agencies should continue during the formulation process of the Human Resource Development Plan. With the HRD Plan in place, the continuing human capacity development program of BARMM is ensured:

NOW, THEREFORE, be it

RESOLVED, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to direct the ministries and offices of the Bangsamoro Government to formulate and implement their respective Career and Human Resource Development Plans towards building an effective and efficient Bangsamoro bureaucracy.

RESOLVED, FURTHER, to forward the foregoing Resolution to all ministries and offices in the BARMM, for information and appropriate consideration.

ADOPTED, Rabi Al-akhir 11, 1443/November 16, 2021.
