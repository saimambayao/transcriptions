**WHEREAS**, Section 1, Article XIV of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides that:

*“The State shall protect and promote the right of all citizens to quality education at all levels, and shall take appropriate steps to make such education accessible to all;”*

**WHEREAS**, the Bureau of Information Office released a news report on July 23, 2024, stating that the Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education (MBHTE) was expecting an increase of more than one million one hundred thousand eight hundred thirty-eight (1,100,838) students for Academic Year 2024-2025, compared to one million seventy-nine thousand two hundred fifty-three (1,079,253) in the previous year. This figure includes students from private and public schools, as well as local universities and colleges (LUCs) in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, To request the Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education to render a report to the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament on the comparative education performance from SY 2018-2019 to SY 2023-2024.
