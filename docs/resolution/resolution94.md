SECOND REGULAR SESSION

RESOLUTION NO. 94

RESOLUTION RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING THE ARMED FORCES OF THE PHILIPPINES (AFP) TO EXERCISE UTMOST CAUTION AND PRUDENCE IN ISSUING STATEMENTS, ESPECIALLY ON THE INSTITUTION OF THE MADARIS, WHICH MIGHT FURTHER ALIENATE THE MUSLIMS IN THE PHILIPPINES TO DELETERIOUS PERCEPTIONS

WHEREAS, madrasah system of education is a quintessence of the Islamic faith professed by Muslims all over the world, and the teachings thereon are based on the primary sources of Islamic Law, foremost of which is the Holy Qurán and the authentic sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, which today is adhered to, and continues to bring comfort to more than 1.8 billion people or roughly more than one in every four persons on the face of the earth;

WHEREAS, today, madaris are scattered nationwide, with the majority found in Central and Western Mindanao. It is estimated that there are between 1,000 and 2,000 madaris in Mindanao with a total student population of between 100,000 and 150,000. Provinces with over 100 madaris each are Lanao del Sur, Basilan, and Maguindanao;

WHEREAS, the development and institutionalization of madrasah education as well as the standard curriculum for elementary public schools and private madaris was approved and prescribed by the Department of Education (DepEd) under DepEd Order No. 51, s. 2004 to counter the radicalization in the country as one of its primary purpose. The Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) had adopted the national standard curriculum by virtue of ARMM RG Executive Order No. 13-A, s. 2004. With these issuances, the madrasah educational system has now been upgraded as a vital component of the national educational system, similar to the mainstream school system;

WHEREAS, Article IX, Section 18 of the Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as Madaris Educational System, Islamic and Arabic Studies, also provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall establish, maintain, and supervise Madaris education in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of which textbooks to be taught in Madrasas are well made, managed and scrutinized by scholars of Islam to preserve its pristine and humane teachings before it is distributed to the different Madrasas in all parts of Mindanao under the supervision of the Bangsamoro Government. Hence, there is no radicalization in Madrasas;

WHEREAS, even in the previous Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). Madrasas were given full attention and well taken care of by the provision of Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act No. 14 Section 3 of Article I that declares the policy to establish, maintain and support a complete and integrated system of quality education that is meaningful, relevant, and responsive to the needs, ideals, and aspiration of the people in Muslim Mindanao, that the regional government shall accredit Madaris and shall ensure their integration into the regional education system which should be at par with the national standard; wherein the results were astounding;

WHEREAS, Pursuant to Article IX, Section 5 of the Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as Religious Freedom provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall guarantee religious freedom and the free exercise thereof pursuant to the Constitution, national laws, and principles of international law. It shall also protect all persons from harassment or any undue pressure, coercion, and violence on account of religion. Any establishment and institution shall be free to implement policies and undertake activities pursuant to their respective religious beliefs and values;

WHEREAS, the statement made by AFP Chief of Staff General Gilbert Gapay on October 13, 2020 that Madrasas are institutions of radicalization activities is not true as terroristic activities which may bring harm to human, animals and trees are not allowed in Islam, and students in Madrasas are taught to be kind to all creation and embrace all the values and good moral that a student could apply in his/her daily life. This is because their Ustadzes always tell them that “If you want that He Who is above the Heaven have mercy upon you, then have mercy on those living on earth”;

WHEREAS, these statements, which can be categorized as sweeping and general with undue degree of conclusiveness, only serve to foment distrust and resentment among the Muslim population, particularly the youth, who are effectively placed under surveillance and restrictions that further alienate them from the mainstream society;

WHEREAS, these statements evoke much concern especially when viewed in the context following the passage of the Republic Act No. 11479 also known as the “Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020,” which sowed fear for-purportedly opening the way for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement and malicious prosecution of innocent people;

WHEREAS, while we recognize and support the inherent need to quell terroristic activities pursuant to the sworn duty of the Armed Forces of the Philippines to protect and preserve the peace and the sovereignty of the Republic of the Philippines, the manner and method, including their pronouncements, must be carefully drawn to avoid further escalation of support to lawless groups by feeding fuel into their propaganda machine;

WHEREAS, utmost caution must be exercised in labeling a delicate aspect of the way of life of a people who had been through the ashes of armed confrontation for decades, hence if the AFP, through their Chief of Staff, is certain, definitive proof of the alleged involvement of Madrasahs in the recruitment of terrorist must be shown in the proper venue and proceedings, before public statements are issued;

WHEREAS, fighting against terrorism which has long been destroying human lives and properties is in reality the concern of the Ulama and Ustadzes teaching in madrasas, as this heinous crime together with suicide bombing mar the beauty of Islam and could eventually suspect the peace-loving teachers of Madrasas in future time;

WHEREAS, on May 12-14, 2017, Ulama Summit Against Terrorism was held in Cotabato City which was attended by Ulama and operators/teachers of Madrasas coming not only from Mindanao but all parts of the Philippines who unanimously united in denouncing terrorism, witnessed by Militaries, the now OPAPP Sec. Carlito G. Galvez Jr., PNP, LGUs and different sectors of society in attendance;

WHEREAS, to even clarify the issues more about Madrasas and its innocence in promoting suicide bombings and radicalization, National Defense Secretary Delfin N. Lorenzana and OPAPP Sec. Carlito G. Galvez Jr. who was then the WestMinCom Chief sat with the Ulama and Teachers of Madrasas to clear the bad suspicions thrown towards them on the “Regional Ulama Solidarity Summit on Peace and Security” dated October 13-14, 2017 at Zamboanga City. So how come that Madrasas are breeding grounds for terrorism and recruitment of suicide bombers while it is Haram (prohibited) in Islam;

WHEREAS, while we commend the effort of the AFP to protect us from enemies inside and outside, we strongly remind the AFP leadership that prejudicial statements that may be considered in the realm of “red tagging” or witch-hunting that would further alienate the Muslims in the Philippines to deleterious perceptions, be prudently refrained without irrefutable proof;

NOW, THEREFORE, be it

RESOLVED, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to respectfully request the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to exercise utmost caution and prudence in issuing statements, especially on the Institutions of Madaris, which might further alienate the Muslims in the Philippines to deleterious perceptions.

RESOLVED, FURTHER, to furnish copy of this resolution to the office of the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines for his information and guidance.
