**RESOLUTION NO. 171**

**RESOLUTION URGING THE BANGSAMORO COMMISSION FOR THE PRESERVATION OF CULTURAL HERITAGE TO PROMOTE, PROTECT, AND PRESERVE THE BOAT MAKING TRADITION IN THE BANGSAMORO BY POSSIBLY DEVELOPING OR ESTABLISHING A SCHOOL OF LIVING TRADITION FOR BOAT MAKING THEREIN**

WHEREAS, Article IX of the Bangsamoro Organic Law, particularly Section 24 thereof, empowers the Bangsamoro Government “to preserve the history, culture, arts, traditions and the rich cultural heritage of the Bangsamoro People”;

WHEREAS, Section 25 thereof makes it a primary responsibility of the Bangsamoro Commission for the Preservation of the Cultural Heritage “to write the history of the Bangsamoro people and to establish and sustain the cultural institutions, programs, and projects in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region”;

WHEREAS, Section 17 thereof also mandates the establishment of “vocational, technical, non-formal, and special education of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region educational system for the poor, illiterate, out-of-school youth, persons with special needs, disadvantaged, and senior citizens shall be supportive and relevant to the human resource requirements of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, which shall conform to the minimum standards set by the National Government”;

WHEREAS, in the island Provinces of Basilan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi, most especially among the Sama tribe, boat making has been an ancestral practice and tradition born both out of necessity and practicality. The “lepa”, in particular in Tawi-Tawi, serves as their dwelling, work station and means of transport;

WHEREAS, in the Province of Sulu, its people, the Tausug, got its name because of their ancestors’ ability to master the sea currents using their boats. The same is relatively true with the Yakan from Basilan;

WHEREAS, the highlight of the celebration or commemoration of the arrival of Shariff Kabunsuan to Maguindanao is a fluvial parade displaying well decorated wooden boats in re-enactment of that blessed day;

WHEREAS, until today, boat remains the only means of inter-island transportation in the island Provinces of Basilan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi;

WHEREAS, these only show not only the well-established tradition of boat making but also its significance to the history and culture of the Bangsamoro people and its continued importance to the growth and progress of the Region:

NOW, THEREFORE, be it

RESOLVED, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to urge the Bangsamoro Commission for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage to promote, protect, and preserve the boat making tradition in the Bangsamoro by possibly developing or establishing a school of living tradition for boat making therein.

RESOLVED, FURTHER, to forward this Resolution to the office of the Bangsamoro Commission for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage, for information and appropriate consideration.

ADOPTED, Rabi ul Awwal 5, 1443/October 12, 2021.
