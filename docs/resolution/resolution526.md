**WHEREAS**, the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), now the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), has been largely excluded from Mindanao’s development processes due to the scant attention it has received from the National Government, particularly in infrastructure development. ARMM received the smallest infrastructure budget in the country, amounting to only nine hundred million pesos (Php 900,000,000.00) annually. As a result, it has the lowest infrastructure development index. Therefore, a comprehensive, long-term Infrastructure Development Plan and Investment Program is essential for BARMM;

**WHEREAS**, Section 4, Article XIII of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the *“Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao”*, mandates that the Parliament shall establish the Bangsamoro Economic Development Council (BEDC), which shall serve as the planning, monitoring, and coordinating agency for all development plans, programs and projects of the Bangsamoro Government. It shall evaluate and recommend short, medium, and long-term comprehensive development plans, programs, and projects for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region for approval of the Parliament.

**WHEREAS**, Section 6, Article VI of the abovementioned Act stipulates that there is hereby created an Intergovernmental Infrastructure Development Board which shall be responsible for coordinating and synchronizing national and Bangsamoro infrastructure development plan.

The National Government and the Bangsamoro Government, through the Intergovernmental Relations Body, shall coordinate the release of said amount to the Bangsamoro Government;

**WHEREAS**, as stated in Section 37, Article XIII of the same law, the National Government shall fund and implement the construction and maintenance of the national roads, bridges, water supply and services, and flood control and irrigation systems and for the maintenance of the existing airports, seaports, and wharves in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region: *Provided*, That, with regard to water supply and services, flood control and irrigation systems that connect or from facilities outside the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, there shall be cooperation and coordination between the Bangsamoro Government and the appropriate national or local government bodies;

**WHEREAS**, Section 21, Article XII of the same law specifically provides that twenty (20) years from the operationalization of the Bangsamoro Government, the following shall be deducted from the block grant:

(a) Revenues from the following taxes imposed and collected in the Bangsamoro territorial jurisdiction by the Bangsamoro Government three (3) years prior:

(1) Capital Gains Tax;

(4) Estate Tax; and

(b) Share of the Bangsamoro Government in the income derived from the exploration, development, and utilization of natural resources, as provided under Section 34, Article XII of this Organic Law, collected three (3) years prior;

**WHEREAS**, the comprehensive 15-year plan coincides with the amounts to be deducted from the Block Grant as provided under Section 21, Article XII of the Republic Act No. 11054;

**WHEREAS**, the formulation processes shall be coordinated by the Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority (BPDA), which was created by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament under Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 6, otherwise known as the *“Bangsamoro Socio-Economic Development Planning Act of 2019”*, to serve as the support office and technical secretariat of the BEDC;

**WHEREAS**, the long-term Infrastructure Development Plan and Investment Program shall be funded by the National Government for national programs, while the Bangsamoro Government shall fund regional programs through the Block Grant;

**WHEREAS**, a copy of the formulated Infrastructure Development Plan and Investment Program of BARMM shall be furnished to the National Government, through the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), for its inclusion in the National Development Plan and Investment Program of the National Government, as required by the Republic Act No. 11054;

**WHEREAS**, the Infrastructure Development Plan and Investment Program shall define the vision, mission, goals, and objectives of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region for infrastructure development, outlining its policies, strategies, and programs, including projects with short, medium, and long-term perspectives;

**WHEREAS**, the Infrastructure Development Plan and Investment Program shall also include priority lists containing proposals at key stages of project development, such as early stages concepts, potential investment options, and investment-ready proposals:

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, To urge the Bangsamoro Economic Development Council and the Inter-Governmental Infrastructure Development Board to jointly formulate a long-term Infrastructure Development Plan and Investment Program in the next fifteen years, from 2023 to 2038, for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.
