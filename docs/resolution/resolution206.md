**RESOLUTION NO. 206**

**RESOLUTION URGENTLY DIRECTING THE BANGSAMORO INTER-AGENCY TASK FORCE (BIATF), ESPECIALLY THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH (MOH)-BARMM, TO STRENGTHEN FURTHER ITS PREVENTIVE RESPONSE AND MEASURES TO THE EMERGING UPSURGE OF COVID-19 – OMICRON VARIANT IN THE COUNTRY TO PREVENT ITS WIDE SPREAD WITHIN THE BARMM**

**WHEREAS**, Section 22, Article IX of RA No. 11054, otherwise known as the “*Organic Law of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao*”, provides, among others, that the Bangsamoro Government shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them;

**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Chapter 1, Title V of the Bangsamoro Administrative Code provides that the Ministry of Health (MOH) shall be primarily responsible for the formulation, planning, implementation and coordination of health policies and programs. It shall promote, protect, preserve and restore the health of the people through the provision and delivery of health services through regulation and encouragement of providers of health goods and services;

**WHEREAS**, in November 2021, while the COVID 19- Delta variant was still creating havoc across the globe, a *new variant* of the novel coronavirus emerged and the World Health Organization (WHO) designated this new B.1.1.529, named Omicron, a variant of concern;

**WHEREAS**, on December 31, 2021, the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the detection of fourteen cases of Omicron variant in the country, seven of which were imported cases. The department further stressed that there was already a “high possibility” of local transmission of this Omicron variant in the country;

**WHEREAS**, in an article, entitled “*Enhancing Readiness for Omicron (B.1.1.529): Technical Brief and Priority Actions for Member States*,” published by the WHO on its official website on December 10, 2021, the organization stated that there is consistent evidence that Omicron has a substantial growth advantage over Delta; it is spreading significantly faster than the Delta variant in countries with documented community transmission, with a doubling time of 1.5 to 3 days;

**WHEREAS**, the DOH confirmed that vaccinated people and even those who have already received booster shots can still be infected by the Omicron variant;

**WHEREAS**, the WHO also reported that there may be an increased risk of reinfection with Omicron (ie, people who have previously had COVID-19 could become reinfected more easily with Omicron) as compared to other variants of concern;

**WHEREAS**, the pediatric group is at a higher risk of infection since they are less protected being unvaccinated. In fact, in recent international and local news, there have been reports of increasing number of children hospitalized with COVID-19 as the Omicron variant’s dominance intensifies;

**WHEREAS**, a well-planned and well-implemented response and measures must be put in place to prevent and/or minimize the spread or transmission of omicron variant within the BARMM Region:

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to urgently direct the BIATF, especially the MOH-BARMM, to strengthen further its preventive response and measures to the emerging upsurge of COVID-19 – Omicron variant in the country to prevent its wide spread within the BARMM.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, to forward the foregoing Resolution to the BIATF and MOH-BARMM, for information and appropriate action.
