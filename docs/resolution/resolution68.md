**FIRST REGULAR SESSION**

**RESOLUTION NO. 68**

**RESOLUTION CONDEMNING THE DISCRIMINATORY PROFILING OF MUSLIM STUDENTS IN METRO MANILA BY THE DISTRICT COMMUNITY AFFAIRS AND DEVELOPMENT DIVISION OF THE MANILA POLICE DISTRICT**

**WHEREAS**, on February 20, 2020, media outlet The Philippine Star published on their Facebook page a copy of a memorandum issued by the Manila Police District, Philippine National Police;

**WHEREAS**, the memorandum, issued on January 31, 2020 by the District Community Affairs and Development Division (DCADD) of the Manila Police District, upon the direction of PBGEN Bernabe M. Balba, ordered their station commanders to submit lists of Muslim students in high schools, colleges and universities in Metro Manila;

**WHEREAS**, the memorandum added that constituting a list of Muslim students is part of the PNP's measures to strengthen peace-building and to counter violent extremism;

**WHEREAS**, the profiling measure targets young Muslims who enjoy the intended safe spaces provided by these educational institutions;

**WHEREAS**, the Alliance of Concerned Teachers on Thursday, February 20, condemned the policy in a statement;

**WHEREAS**, Manila - particularly Quiapo - houses the biggest mosque in Metro Manila, and is home to the largest number of Muslim families in the capital;

**WHEREAS**, the city of Manila hosts some of the biggest schools and universities in the country across the University Belt, which is believed to be home to thousands of Muslim students who are either from other parts of Metro Manila or from Mindanao;

**WHEREAS**, Section 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states:

“*No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.*”

**WHEREAS**, through this memorandum, the Manila Police District implies that young Muslims are potential violent extremists who require more scrutiny and attention from the law enforcement group. The Muslim youth is subjected to this intrusion due to their religious affiliation, which is a form of discrimination;

**WHEREAS**, this move by the Manila Police District puts the young Muslims at worst possible risk of unjust treatment and isolation, deprivation of opportunities, and physical harm;

**WHEREAS**, effectively combatting violent extremism requires a community that is harmonious, with the freedom to assert its members' rights and identity, and is free of injustice;

**NOW, THEREFORE**, be it

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved, in the interest of upholding human rights, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority condemns the prejudicial treatment of Muslim youth by the Manila Police District of the Philippine National Police.

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, a body of multi-cultural representation, denounces religious and all other forms of discrimination, which it deems disgraceful and unbefitting of any agency of government or personnel thereof.

**RESOLVED FURTHERMORE**, that the Bangsamoro Transition Authority strongly appeals to our fellow public servants and the government institutions to which they belong to be more circumspect in introducing policies so that they promote inclusion and harmony instead of exclusion and disunity.

**RESOLVED FINALLY**, to forward the forgoing resolution to Secretary Eduardo M. Año of the Department of Interior and Local Government, Philippine National Police Chief Archie Francisco "Chie" Feranil Gamboa and Metro Manila Police Chief, Maj. Gen. Debold Sinas for information and appropriate action.

**Adopted, February 21, 2020.**
