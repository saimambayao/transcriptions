**WHEREAS**, Section 9, Article XIII of the 1987 Constitution states that the State shall, by law, and for the common good, undertake, in cooperation with the public sector, a continuing program of urban land reform and housing which will make available at affordable cost decent housing and basic services to underprivileged and homeless citizens in urban centers and resettlements areas. It shall also promote adequate employment opportunities for such citizens. In the implementation of such program, the State shall respect the rights of small property owners;

**WHEREAS**, Paragraph 1, Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that *“Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and his family. The right to an adequate standard of living requires, at a minimum, that everyone shall enjoy the necessary subsistence rights, adequate food and nutrition, clothing, and housing. As a universal economic, social, and cultural right, the right to adequate housing guarantees the right to live in security, peace, and dignity;”*

**WHEREAS**, Section 8, Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) states that the Bangsamoro Government shall provide, maintain, and ensure the delivery of basic and responsive health programs, quality education, appropriate services, livelihood opportunities, affordable and progressive housing projects, power and electricity, and water inhabitants of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. It shall maintain appropriate disaster-preparedness units for immediate and effective relief services to victims of natural and man-made calamities. It shall also ensure the rehabilitation of calamity-affected areas and victims of calamities;

**WHEREAS**, Section 9 of the same article of the BOL states that the Parliament shall pass a law creating a housing and human settlements agency to address the lack of shelters, settlements, and livelihood for the disadvantaged and homeless, especially those victims of conflicts and atrocities. The agency may directly solicit and receive assistance, donations, aids, and grants from donors for its housing, settlements, and livelihood programs and development. The Bangsamoro Government, in cooperation with the private sector, shall develop its own housing and human settlement programs;

**WHEREAS**, Republic Act No. 7279 otherwise known as the *“Urban Development and Housing Act of 1992”*, states that it shall be the policy of the State to undertake, in cooperation with the private sector, a comprehensive and continuing Urban Development and Housing Program;

**WHEREAS**, the said program shall cover all lands in urban and urbanizable areas, including existing areas for priority development, zonal improvement sites, slum improvement and resettlement sites, and other areas that may be identified by the local government units as suitable for socialized housing;

**WHEREAS**, legislative oversight functions include reviewing government programs, conducting inquiries, writing reports, and making recommendations to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability in government operations, with the end view of promoting transparency, public participation, and democracy;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority (BPDA) is created under Section 14 of Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 06 as the socio-economic development planning and policy coordinating authority of the Bangsamoro Government;

**WHEREAS**, the BPDA is mandated as responsible for development planning, investment programming, monitoring and evaluation, and coordination of all development initiatives in the region;

**WHEREAS**, the first ($1^{\text{st}}$) Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP) 2020-2022 was prepared by the Bangsamoro Government through its six (6) planning committees and the BPDA, formerly the Regional Planning and Development Office, as its Technical Secretariat;

**WHEREAS**, the BDP reflects the Bangsamoro Government’s shared analysis of the realities, problems, and opportunities in the region. It also presents an opportunity to improve development planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation at the regional level. The BDP is also intended to provide an appreciation of the context of the region in terms of its situation, challenges, priority programs, and projects, as well as the legislative agenda of the Bangsamoro Government during the transition period;

**WHEREAS**, based on the first ($1^{\text{st}}$) BDP, there is a high demand for housing units in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) due to reasons such as the requirements of the decommissioned combatants who are the main beneficiaries of the Normalization Program, and the increased number of internally displaced persons following the Marawi Siege in 2017. The inclusion of Cotabato City and sixty-three (63) barangays from North Cotabato in BARMM also increased the number of target beneficiaries of housing and human settlement projects;

**WHEREAS**, housing is an essential necessity of an individual. It is considered as an economic engine for the low-income families as it plays a vital role in the growth and development of the family, the community, and the country;

**WHEREAS**, housing is key to the indispensable right of the Bangsamoro people to self-determination and in ensuring the long-term development of the Bangsamoro Region;

**WHEREAS**, data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees shows that as of November 30, 2022, an estimated total number of thirty-two thousand two hundred sixteen (32,216) families and one hundred fifty-eight thousand seven hundred twenty-five (158,725) individuals remain displaced in Mindanao;

**WHEREAS**, after three (3) years of the implementation of the BDP and with the assumption of the new Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) members, there is a need to identify the gaps, issues, and concerns in the implementation of the housing program;

**WHEREAS**, by directing the BPDA to apprise the BTA Parliament on the overall status of the housing program of BARMM in relation to the implementation of the first ($1^{\text{st}}$) Bangsamoro Development Plan, the BTA Parliament will acquire information that can serve as basis for the formulation and development of policies:
