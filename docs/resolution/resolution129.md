**WHEREAS,** Deputy Speaker and Basilan Congressman Mujiv S.

**WHEREAS,** Sec. 27, Title XVII, Chapter 1, of the Bangsamoro Administrative Code (Bangsamoro Autonomous Act No. 13) states that, *“The National Commission on Human Rights and the Commission may agree to conduct joint investigations on human rights violations and abuses that occurred either outside the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region when the subject of the investigation involves Bangsamoro, or within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region when the subject of the investigation is of national complexion.”*;

**WHEREAS,** Deputy Speaker Mujiv Hataman, with the support of Anak Mindanao Rep. Amihilda Sangcopan and our other Moro congressmen, have filed resolutions calling for the probe into the warrantless arrest of Muslims in Cavite and elsewhere;
