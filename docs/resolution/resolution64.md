**RESOLUTION NO. 64**

**RESOLUTION EXPRESSING FULL SUPPORT TO THE PASSAGE OF THE HOUSE BILL NO. 5687 AND SENATE BILL NO. 1232, ESTABLISHING THE AUTONOMOUS REGION OF THE CORDILLERA**

**WHEREAS**, Section 15, Article X of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides that there shall be created autonomous regions in Muslim Mindanao and in the Cordilleras consisting of provinces, cities, municipalities, and geographical areas sharing common and distinctive historical and cultural heritage, economic and social structures, and other relevant characteristics within the framework of this Constitution and the national sovereignty as well as territorial integrity of the Republic of the Philippines;

**WHEREAS**, pursuant to this mandate, the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) was established in 1989 by virtue of Republic Act No. 6734, and was strengthened and expanded by Republic Act No. 9054 in 2001;

**WHEREAS**, thirty years thereafter, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) was established through the passage of Republic Act No. 11054 and its ratification in a plebiscite, thereby replacing the ARMM. The Bangsamoro Organic Law which seeks to address the historical injustices in the Bangsamoro and bring long-lasting peace in Muslim Mindanao, received massive support from the National Government, the regional and local governments, the different sectors of the society, and more importantly, the Bangsamoro People;

**WHEREAS**, equally important as the Muslim Mindanao’s are the Cordillera’s struggle for self-determination and bid for autonomy. However, the Autonomous Region in Cordillera is yet to be realized;

**WHEREAS**, House Bill No. 5343 was filed in 2017 to create the Autonomous Region in Cordillera. Said bill is supported by all House Representatives from the Cordillera region, and for the first time in history, all provincial and city governments throughout the Cordillera expressed their expressed commitment of support to the region’s bid for autonomy;

**WHEREAS**, the Senate versions of the bill were filed in 2018 as Senate Bill Nos. 1678, 1923 and 1930;

**WHEREAS**, House Bill No. 5687 entitled “An Act Establishing the Autonomous Region of the Cordillera” was recently introduced by the District Representatives of Abra, Apayao, Ifugao, Mountain Province, Benguet, Baguio City, and Kalinga;

**WHEREAS**, Senate Bill No. 1232 entitled “An Act Establishing the Autonomous Region of the Cordillera” was recently filed by Senator Juan Miguel F. Zubiri last December 11, 2019.

**WHEREAS**, “Cordillera autonomy is seen as the most effective option to provide the region with the needed solid foundation to pursue sustainable development as the region hopes to benefit from the management and use of its natural resources. Cordillera autonomy will bring the national attention as well as the benefits of accepting and promoting cultural diversity through the formulation of multi-cultural policies for Indigenous Peoples (IPs).”

**WHEREAS**, the Regional Development Council - Cordillera Administrative Region also issued a resolution expressing support to the ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) of the BARMM recognizes the significance of support coming from the National Government, agencies, local government units and other sectors of the society in the pursuit of autonomy;

**WHEREAS**, the BTA likewise believes that the Cordillera’s pursuit of autonomy also deserves the same amount of attention and support as that of the Bangsamoro;

**NOW, THEREFORE**, be it

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Parliament to express its support in the passage and enactment of the bill creating the Autonomous Region of the Cordillera.

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, to forward the forgoing resolution to Senate President Vicente "Tito" Castelo Sotto III, House of Representative Speaker Alan Peter Schramm Cayetano and the Office of the Cordillera Administrative Region for information.

**Adopted**, February 21, 2020.
