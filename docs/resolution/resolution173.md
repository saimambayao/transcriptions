**RESOLUTION NO. 173**

**RESOLUTION RESPECTFULLY APPEALING TO PRESIDENT RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE TO ALLOW THE INCUMBENT MEMBERS OF THE BANGSAMORO TRANSITION AUTHORITY (BTA) TO CONTINUE IN SERVICE UNTIL 2025 BY GIVING PRIMARY CONSIDERATION IN THEIR APPOINTMENT**

WHEREAS, the Senate of the Philippines on September 27, 2021 ratified the bill that seeks to postpone the scheduled first regular elections in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) in 2022;

WHEREAS, the said bill extends the Bangsamoro transition period and gives the President the power to appoint the eighty (80) members of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) to serve during the extension of the transition period;

WHEREAS, the incumbent members of the BTA have undergone intensive and rigorous screening and selection process for appointment as members of the BTA;

WHEREAS, the appointment of new members may possibly delay the accomplishment of the mandates of the BTA Parliament like the passage of priority codes and other important legislations as it will entail new learnings, skills and knowledge as to the rudiments of the parliamentary system of governance;

WHEREAS, the incumbent members of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) have invested so much time and effort not only in discharging their functions as stated in R.A. No. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law, which includes the enactment of priority codes, but also in making sure that they acquire the essential skills and knowledge to properly perform their duties and responsibilities in accordance with the said law;

WHEREAS, in the pursuit of offering excellent delivery of public service in the Bangsamoro, the Members of the BTA Parliament equipped themselves, together with their staffs, with in-depth understanding of the parliamentary system and how their role should serve the institution as a whole;

WHEREAS, various institutions such as the Parliament of Malaysia, Clingendael Academy, Ateneo School of Government (ASOG), Konrad Adenauer Stiftung (KAS), Westminster Foundation for Democracy (WFD), British Embassy of Manila, Japan International Cooperation Agency, Development Academy of the Philippines, European Union (Support to Bangsamoro Transition), World Bank, The Asia Foundation, Government of Australia, UK Government, and National Defense College of the Philippines (NDCP) among others, have for almost two years and half all invested so much for trainings and other capacity-building interventions to the incumbent Members of BTA as to their roles in building efficient and effective institutions, and as to the processes or technicalities involved in a parliamentary system;

WHEREAS, the present membership of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority is characterized by a diverse and ethnic-balanced composition considering that the BARMM provinces and all sectors like religious sector, settlers, non-Moro IP, traditional leaders, academe, women, youth, peace advocates, former National Government Officials, members of Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), former Officials of ARMM, technocrats, Career Executive Service eligibles, and former BTC Members who drafted the Bangsamoro Organic Law are repository of the intent and spirit of the Bangsamoro Organic Law;

WHEREAS, there is an undeniable advantage in giving primary consideration to the incumbent members of the BTA for reappointment on account of the experience, training, skills, knowledge, and wisdom that they have acquired in addition to the legislations, policies, programs, and advocacies they have pursued and accomplished in accordance with the transition plan and the peace process;

WHEREAS, by allowing them to continue their service and what they have started, the preservation of the momentum will have a positive effect in the institution as whole in view of the eventual accomplishment of pending legislations, projects, and programs which are vital to the transition;

WHEREAS, a disruption of service which could have an unintended adverse effect of restarting the whole operations can be avoided by recognizing the importance of the continuity and stability of the transition;

WHEREAS, the President of the Republic of the Philippines has the sole power to appoint the members of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority:

NOW, THEREFORE, be it

RESOLVED, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to respectfully appeal to President Rodrigo Roa Duterte to allow the incumbent Members of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) to continue in service until 2025 by giving primary consideration in their appointment.

RESOLVED, FURTHER, to forward the foregoing Resolution to the President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, the Office of the Presidential Adviser for Unity, Peace and Reconciliation, the Department of National Defense, and the Department of Interior and Local Government, for information and appropriate consideration.

ADOPTED, Rabi ul Awwal 5, 1443/October 12, 2021.
