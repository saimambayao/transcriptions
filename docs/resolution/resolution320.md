**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Article II of R.A. No. 11054, otherwise known as the "*Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao*," states that:

“*The Bangsamoro Parliament hereinafter referred to as the "Parliament," shall adopt the official flag, emblem, and hymn of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. The flag of the Republic of the Philippines shall always be displayed alongside the Bangsamoro flag.*”

**WHEREAS**, Section 2 (Declaration of Policy) of Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 1, otherwise known as “*An Act Adopting the Official Flag of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao*,” (BAA No. 1) provides:

“*In the exercise of its right to self-governance, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao is free to adopt its Bangsamoro Flag that is reflective of its people's identity, history, heritage, struggles and aspiration.*”

**WHEREAS**, Section 4 of BAA Act No. 1 provides that:

“*All Bangsamoro offices, public and private schools, colleges and universities, public offices, government-owned or controlled corporations and other government instrumentalities are required to use and display the Bangsamoro Flag. Other offices of the Bangsamoro that are outside its area of autonomy are likewise required to use and display the Bangsamoro Flag.*”
