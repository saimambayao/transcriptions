**SECOND REGULAR SESSION**

**RESOLUTION NO. 80**

**RESOLUTION EXPRESSING THE DEEP CONCERN OF THE BANGSAMORO TRANSITION AUTHORITY (BTA) OVER THE SERIES OF KILLINGS OF MOROS OUTSIDE BARMM COMMUNITY PARTICULARLY IN THE MUNICIPALITIES OF POLOMOLOK AND TUPI, SOUTH COTABATO**

**WHEREAS**, the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides that:

“Section 5, Article II, Declaration of Principles and State Policies - The maintenance of peace and order, the protection of life, liberty, and property, and the promotion of the general welfare are essential for the enjoyment by all the people of the blessings of democracy.; and

Section 1, Article III, Bill of Rights - No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of the laws.”;

**WHEREAS**, Section 12, Article VI of Republic Act No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law provides that: “Assistance to Bangsamoro Communities - The national government shall ensure the protection of the rights of the Bangsamoro people residing in communities outside the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region and undertake programs for their rehabilitation and development. The Bangsamoro government, in coordination with the local government units where these communities are located and the appropriate national government agencies, shall provide assistance to enhance their economic, social, and cultural development.”;

**WHEREAS**, in a Memorandum dated June 4, 2020 ***(attached as Annex “A” and forms part of this resolution)***, the Chairman of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front-Coordinating Committee on Cessation of Hostilities (MILF-CCCH) submitted a report to the Chairman of the MILF Peace Implementing Panel regarding the security concerns of Bangsamoro Communities in Polomolok and Tupi, South Cotabato, municipalities outside BARMM;

**WHEREAS**, the report contains in substance the following:

“*On June 2, 2020, members of the MILF-CCCH went to Brgy. Koronadal Proper, Polomolok, South Cotabato, to personally extend their condolences (Ta’ziyah) to the bereaved families of Ustadz Mohammad Taha Abdulgapor, a member of the Local Monitoring Team, BOD Secretary of the Bangsamoro Development Authority, and a respected Professor of Mindanao State University of General Santos City, who was shot dead in General Santos City while driving his car last May 26, 2020. He is the recent victim of the gruesome killings of Moros in the areas of South Cotabato, among others.*

*During this visit, they received first-hand reports from MILF communities in the adjacent Municipalities in Polomolok and Tupi regarding the fear and threats they have been experiencing from government authorities, particularly the PNP in the area. Accordingly, Moro constituents in the area, especially men, evacuate every night and return home by morning because they are frightened by the series of killings in which victims are mostly MILF personalities, and continuous PNP surveillance of their communities.*

*During the month of May (Ramadhan) 2020, Ustadz Abdulgapor facilitated the crafting of a resolution of the MILF Koronadal Provincial Committee requesting the BARMM leadership to intervene on the series of killings in Polomolok and Tupi, both of South Cotabato Province, of MILF members and Moro civilians since 2018. These incidents particularly the killings of fifteen (15) personalities, this time including Ustadz Abdulgapor himself, need urgent intervention to serve justice to the victims and to prevent its recurrence to other innocent individuals.*

*As an initial intervention, the MILF CCCH requested to their counterpart in the Government of the Philippines the urgent creation of Joint Ceasefire Monitoring (JCMP) Post in Polomolok and Tupi composed of neutral forces from AFP and PNP together with the BIAF-MILF to mitigate the tension currently happening. They believe that a JCMP is a viable preliminary action to pacify this alarming situation. It can contribute significantly in neutralizing the perpetrators and pave the way for the establishment of peace, security, and development in the area.*”

**WHEREAS**, a resolution dated May 8, 2020 from the Office of the Chairman, Koronadal Provincial Committee, MILF ***(attached as Annex “B” and forms part of this resolution)***, was appended to the report. It contained in substance that:

1. The Bangsamoro constituents in the Municipalities of Tupi and Polomolok are now in the state of fear and terrifying condition due to the series of killings, PNP operations, arrests, searches and seizures in the area since 2017. The killings are mostly perpetrated by riding in tandem believed to be organized with blessings from higher authorities;

2. The PNP in the area is justifying their move in the guise of running after lawless elements to include “ISIS” and consider all Bangsamoro involved in any Moro political and social programs and activities as lawless elements or involved in drug related activities;

3. This move resulted to the killing and torture of more than 20 Moro people in Tupi and Población Polomolok with no effective response, reaction or investigation from the concerned authorities;

4. The Committee also believes that the PNP’s constant and tight patrolling activities in Muslim communities are conducted to monitor any Moro going out to Poblacion Polomolok and to justify their actions in the killings of Moros by organized riding in tandem without further actions;

4. The MILF leadership outside of the BARMM core territories is appealing to the BARMM leadership to intervene by calling the attention of the Local Government of South Cotabato, especially LGU Polomolok, to institute proper and full blown investigation to give justice to all the victims, to protect the Moro residents of the area and to avoid tagging them as terrorists subject to constant monitoring by authorities as these acts place them in a traumatic situation, sleepless night and self-restriction in going out to Poblacion Polomolok for fear of being victims of this organized riding in tandem;

5. The BARMM government can help them by knocking to the door of LGU South Cotabato, particularly the Municipality of Polomolok, on this alarming situation, otherwise, the MILF in South Cotabato is left with no other option but to resist the killings to the extent of using similar force;

6. Although there is a ceasefire agreement, they observe that it is sometimes disregarded particularly for those outside the core territories of BARMM, thus, they feel left out and remain deprived of peace and order by no less than the oppressive authorities;

7. The BARMM should craft guidelines jointly with LGU South Cotabato to include observance of due process in the arrest of suspects and to reactivate the guidelines mandated to MILF TASK FORCE to be allied with the AFP and PNP in containing lawless elements in the area,

8. No remedies can be had on these issues without BARMM intervention in calling out the attention of their LGU counterpart before anything else happens which may lead to dire consequences. Presently, the Bangsamoro in Polomolok, particularly the Barangays of Lapu, Bentung, Koronadal Proper, and Sumbakil, are frightened by the irregular movements of the PNP after two (2) of its members were killed in an ambush by unidentified lawless elements believed to be of Nilong Group as declared by them. This act may result to a possible encounter with the MILF elements in the area if the latter are pushed to the end despite defensive stance respecting the observance of the ceasefire agreement;

**WHEREAS**, there is an urgent and pressing need to address these serious issues of killings of MILF personalities and other Moro civilian constituents in Tupi and Polomolok, all municipalities of South Cotabato, territories outside BARMM, to bring the perpetrators to justice and to provide the general community of Moros in the area with sustainable peace and security and to uphold their rights to be provided protection by the government.

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the BTA Parliament, to express the deep concern of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority over the series of killings of Moros outside BARMM community particularly in the municipalities of Polomolok and Tupi, South Cotabato.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, to urge the concerned authorities to conduct an impartial and full-blown investigation of these series of killings to bring the perpetrators to justice.

**RESOLVED, FURTHERMORE**, to strongly recommend to the GPH and MILF Peace Implementing Panels to convene and institute peace mechanisms and sustainable security for the protection of Moros in the area including their rights.

**RESOLVED, FINALLY**, to forward the foregoing Resolution to His Excellency President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, the Honorable BARMM Chief Minister Ahod Balawag Ebrahim, the Chair of the Philippine Government Peace Implementing Panel Honorable Gloria J. Mercado, the Chair of the MILF Peace Implementing Panel Honorable Mohagher M. Iqbal, the Honorable Secretary Eduardo Año of the Department of the Interior and Local Government, and the Chief of Philippine National Police PDG Archie Francisco F. Gamboa, for information and appropriate consideration.

Adopted, July 16, 2020.
