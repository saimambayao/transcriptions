SECOND REGULAR SESSION

RESOLUTION NO. 367

RESOLUTION DIRECTING THE PARLIAMENT AND ALL MINISTRIES, OFFICES AND AGENCIES OF THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENT TO IMMEDIATELY IMPLEMENT AND STRICTLY FOLLOW MEMORANDUM ORDER NO. 285 SERIES OF 2019 ISSUED BY CHIEF MINISTER AHOD B. EBRAHIM BANNING SINGLE-USE PLASTICS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM)

WHEREAS, the Philippines is notoriously tagged as one of the top countries with a high incidence of plastic waste and land-based plastic pollution thrown into the ocean;

WHEREAS, the Philippines is considered as the largest contributor of plastic waste worldwide, contributing an estimated 0.75 million metric tons of plastic every year to the ocean;

WHEREAS, plastic leaking into the environment can impose severe dangers to wildlife, particularly marine organisms that ingest and get entangled with various plastic waste found in the ocean - causing external and internal injuries and blockages in their digestive tracts and airways eventually causing their death;

WHEREAS, National Solid Waste Management Commission (NSWMC) Resolution No. 1363, Series of 2020, mandates the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) to prepare and implement the banning of the use of “unnecessary” single-use plastic products by national government agencies, local government units (LGUs), and government-owned and controlled corporations;

WHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the Bangsamoro people to minimize, if not eradicate the use, sale, and provision of single-use plastics and encourage the utilization of eco-friendly, reusable and biodegradable materials and alternatives;

WHEREAS, in direct response to climate change adaptation, the Chief Minister, Ahod B. Ebrahim, issued Memorandum Order No. 285 dated June 17, 2019, calling for the adoption of a “Ban on Single-Use Plastics” policy in all offices of the BARMM;

WHEREAS, more than three (3) years since the issuance of the said memorandum, it is readily observable that plastics are still proliferating in every corner of the Bangsamoro Government Center (BGC). Despite the issuance of this Memorandum, bottled mineral water, plastic bags, straws, cups, plates, spoons, forks, Styrofoam, and plastic containers are consistently utilized and provided during meetings, functions and seminars in the BGC, in open and direct violation of “Ban on Single-Use Plastics” policy;

WHEREAS, similarly, despite the issuance of Memorandum Order No. 285 requiring all officials and employees to utilize reusable drinking containers, tumblers, mugs, and/or biodegradable food packs, it is noticeable that compliance among concerned employees is virtually nil;

WHEREAS, Memorandum Order No. 285 requires food concessionaires and caterers serving and providing meals/snacks during meetings, functions, and seminars in the BARMM to use containers made of paper, plant-based wrappers, or reusable containers. However, it is visible to the naked eye that there is much to be desired in terms of compliance with this policy:

NOW, THEREFORE, be it

RESOLVED, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, To direct ministries, offices and agencies of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), including those of the BTA to strictly follow and immediately implement Memorandum Order No. 285, Series of 2019 as our small sacrifice but great contribution to save and conserve the environment.

RESOLVED, FURTHER, That all officials and employees be strictly required to use reusable drinking containers, tumblers, mugs, and/or biodegradable food packs.

RESOLVED, FURTHER, That all food concessionaires and caterers be sternly reminded to immediately follow and implement the aforesaid Memorandum enjoining them to place food in containers either made of paper, plant-based wrappers or reusable plastic containers.

RESOLVED FURTHER, That the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources and Energy (MENRE) is tasked to furnish an annual report to the Parliament on the compliance of this Resolution.

RESOLVED FINALLY, That the Bangsamoro Information Office (BIO) is directed to develop and disseminate information materials in line with the implementation of this Resolution.

ADOPTED, Dhul Hijjah 30, 1444/July 18, 2023.
