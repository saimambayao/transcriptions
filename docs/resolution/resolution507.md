**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Article IV of the same Act states that *“In the exercise of its right to self-governance, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is free to pursue its political, economic, social, and cultural development as provided for in the Organic Law;”*

**WHEREAS**, President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, Jr. administered the oath to 80 newly appointed and re-appointed members of the BTA during a ceremony at Malacañang Palace on August 12, 2022;

**WHEREAS**, the BTA, being the interim government of BARMM, plays a significant role as an instrument of inclusive, beneficial, transparent, and ensure the smooth implementation of the provisions of the Republic Act No. 11054 and the CAB before the end of the transition period;

**WHEREAS**, on September 9, 2024, the Supreme Court promulgated its *“En Banc”* decision on the case of *“Province of Sulu, et al. v. Medialdea, et al.,”* with General Register Nos. 242255, 243246, and 243693, ruling that Republic Act No. 11054 is constitutional, while excluding the Province of Sulu from the jurisdiction of BARMM after the province rejected the law’s ratification in the plebiscite;

**WHEREAS**, the Supreme Court’s decision to exclude the province of Sulu from BARMM has caused and created ambiguities in the provisions of the BTA’s already enacted Bangsamoro Autonomy Acts, which can tremendously affect crucial aspects of the upcoming BARMM parliamentary elections, including the composition of the Bangsamoro Parliament, the distribution of seats in parliamentary districts, and the rights to vote and to be elected, including representation, among other things;

**WHEREAS**, the BARMM’s official receipt of the Supreme Court decision was on September 16, 2024;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Attorney-General’s Office (BAGO) was created by virtue of Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 5 or otherwise known as, *“An Act Creating the Bangsamoro Attorney-General’s Office, Defining Its Functions and Powers, Appropriating Funds Therefor, and for Other Related Purposes”;*

**WHEREAS**, Section 4, Article II of the abovementioned Act provides that the Bangsamoro Attorney-General is mandated to be the chief legal counsel of the Bangsamoro Government;

**WHEREAS**, on October 1, 2024, the Bangsamoro Government, through the BAGO, filed a Motion for Leave to intervene and to admit the attached Motion for Partial Reconsideration before the Supreme Court on its decision excluding the Province of Sulu from the BARMM;

**WHEREAS**, under the Rules of Court, particularly Section 1, Rule 19, it is provided, *“A person who has a legal interest in the matter in litigation, or in the success of either of the parties, or an interest against both, or is so situated as to be adversely affected by a distribution or other disposition of property in the custody of the court or an officer thereof may, with leave of court, be allowed to intervene in the action. Court shall consider whether or not intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of rights of the original parties, and whether or not the intervenor’s rights may be fully protected in a separate proceeding;”*

**WHEREAS**, Section 1, Rule 52 of the said Rule states that *“A party may file a Motion for Reconsideration of a judgment of final resolution within fifteen (15) days from notice thereof, with proof of service on the adverse party;”*

**WHEREAS**, the Motion for Leave to intervene filed by BAGO is its way to request the Supreme Court’s permission to allow the Bangsamoro Government to be part of the case, despite it not originally being involved in the proceeding;

**WHEREAS**, BAGO Officer-in-Charge Atty. Mohammad Al-Amin Julkipli said in an interview that *“for us in the BARMM, there is a special circumstance because when this case was filed in 2018, the BARMM was not yet constituted. When it was already pending in the [Supreme] Court, the BARMM, even though it has already been constituted, was not formally impleaded; meaning, throughout the light life of the case, the autonomous region itself was never a party;”*

**WHEREAS**, he also clarified that as written in the judgment, the Supreme Court decision is “immediately executory” and not *“final and executory,”* which means that there is still room to resort to legal remedies, such as a Motion for Partial Reconsideration;

**WHEREAS**, he further said, *“more importantly, as the Chief Minister emphasized, it is because the province of Sulu is very fundamental to the cause of the Bangsamoro… and that it is part and parcel of the Bangsamoro identity with a very important role to play in our continuous struggle for our autonomy and development as one people;”*

**WHEREAS**, several members of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) Parliament have also filed similar motions before the Supreme Court;

**WHEREAS**, on October 17, 2024, BTA Parliament Deputy Speaker, Atty. Laisa Masuhud Alamia, filed a Motion for Leave to intervene, with an attached Motion for Partial Reconsideration, before the Supreme Court, arguing that excluding the Province of Sulu from the Muslim autonomous region would disrupt the ongoing peace and development efforts in the region, as it contradicts the longstanding sociocultural cohesion of the Bangsamoro people;

**WHEREAS**, moreover, she stated that *“it is our hope that we can continue to work on building a just and lasting peace for our people, including our constituents in Sulu. Otherwise, we might end up being forced apart despite our desire to uplift every Bangsamoro as our people intended when we struggled together for our right to self-determination;”*

**WHEREAS**, on October 18, 2024, Member of Parliament (MP) Engr. Don Arbison Loong, together with MP Adzfar Usman, Atty. Nazir Ynawat, Atty. Jamal Kulayan, Nasser Arbison Loong, Mhavejekamar L. Marrack of Tulong Lupah Sug, and Atty. Moh Raf Tungupon Baird, also formally submitted a Motion to Intervene and a Verified Motion for Partial Reconsideration before the Supreme Court;

**WHEREAS**, they argued that the exclusion of Sulu directly contradicts the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, which was designed to unify the historically and culturally connected areas of Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago into one cohesive Bangsamoro region;

**WHEREAS**, they outlined in their petition how the Province of Sulu would be deprived of essential funding and development programs critical to its future, further stating that in 2024, the Ministry of Finance, Budget, and Management (MFBM) allocated over Four Billion Five Hundred Million Pesos (P4.5B) to support seven thousand eight hundred seventy-two (7,872) positions in Sulu’s ministries and offices, which represent more than just numbers, as they are lifelines for thousands of families, fueling hope and stability in the region;

**WHEREAS**, the Supreme Court decision, as soon as it becomes final and executory, will completely remove the Province of Sulu from the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region’s jurisdiction, which will have a significant impact on the offices established, the associated infrastructures, and the personnel employed therein;

**WHEREAS**, the Province of Sulu’s exclusion will entail legal, financial, administrative, and social changes that will have far-reaching implications to the entire Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS**, absent its absolute finality, the decision’s immediate implementation could cause instability and confusion in the region, which could have serious effects for the Province of Sulu and its residents, as well as for the region’s larger governance and peace-building initiatives;

**WHEREAS**, in addition to its legal significance, the Province of Sulu’s strong and deep historical and cultural ties to the Bangsamoro identity and struggle makes it an integral part of the Bangsamoro;

**WHEREAS**, without the Province of Sulu and its people, the Bangsamoro would never be the same;

**WHEREAS**, the transition period plays a crucial role in ensuring the smooth establishment of BARMM as an autonomous political entity, with enhanced self-governance and jurisdiction over the Bangsamoro region, free from legal impediments;

**WHEREAS**, during the regular session of the BTA Parliament on September 16, 17, 18, and 19, 2024, MPs Don Mustapha Loong, Nabil Tan, Tawakal Midtimbang, Romeo Sema, Eddie Alih, Hamid Malik, Jose Lorena, Matarul Estino, and Baileng Mantawil delivered privilege speeches with regard to the exclusion of Sulu from the BARMM, and in the course of period of interpellations, MP Rasol Mitmug, Jr. raised a motion recommending to the Government of the Day, through the Bangsamoro Attorney General’s Office, to file a Motion for Reconsideration:

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, To express support to the motions filed by the Bangsamoro Attorney General’s Office and other individual motions before the Supreme Court regarding the exclusion of the Province of Sulu from the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, To forward a copy of this Resolution to the Supreme Court for consideration and appropriate action.
