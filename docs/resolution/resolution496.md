**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Article IV of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as “*Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (OLBARMM)*”, provides that “*in the exercise of its right to self-governance, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is free to pursue its political, economic, social, and cultural development as provided for in this Organic Law;*”

**WHEREAS**, Section 3, Article V of the OLBARMM states that the Bangsamoro Government shall “*exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance;*”

**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Article VII of the same law states that “*the powers of government are vested in the Parliament which shall exercise those powers and functions expressly granted to it in this Organic Law, and those necessary for, or incidental to, the proper governance and development of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. It shall set policies, legislate on matters within its authority;*”

**WHEREAS**, Section 3, Article VII of the same law states that “*the Parliament shall have the authority to enact laws on matters that are within the powers and competencies of the Bangsamoro Government;*”

**WHEREAS**, five (5) years have passed since the founding of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) and the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) Parliament;

**WHEREAS**, numerous legislative measures have been approved by the BTA Parliament. According to the BARMM Government’s official website, the BTA Parliament has adopted four hundred forty-four (444) resolutions as of February 29, 2024;

**WHEREAS**, there are still hundreds of proposed resolutions pending the scrutiny and approval of the BTA Parliament;

**WHEREAS**, there is no institutionalized mechanism to track the progress and status of implementation of BTA-adopted resolutions by concerned entities with such legislative measures;

**WHEREAS**, given the number of legislative measures and to ensure the implementation of such, a mechanism should be developed to track the status of implementation of BTA-adopted resolutions by concerned ministries, offices, local government units (LGUs), and other stakeholders so as not to let these measures with noble intentions go to waste through only being stuck on paper;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, That the Office of the Secretary-General of the BTA Parliament be directed to report to the Parliament such status of implementation by the concerned ministries, offices, LGUs, and other stakeholders through a quarterly report.

**RESOLVED, FINALLY**, To forward this Resolution to the Office of the Secretary-General of the BTA Parliament, for information.
