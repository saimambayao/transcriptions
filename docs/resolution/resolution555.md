**RESOLUTION PRESCRIBING THE ACCOUNTING AND LIQUIDATION OF THE RESPECTIVE BUDGETARY ALLOCATIONS OF EACH MEMBER OF THE PARLIAMENT AS CLASSIFIED AND CONSISTENT WITH APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING RULES**

**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Article XII of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the *“Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao”*, provides that the Commission on Audit shall be the exclusive auditor of the Bangsamoro Government and its constituent local government units. The Bangsamoro Government shall establish an auditing body which shall have internal auditing responsibility in accordance with Republic Act No. 3456, otherwise known as the *“Internal Auditing Act of 1962”*, as amended. The Bangsamoro Government shall implement transparency and accountability mechanisms consistent with open government practices and generally accepted financial management principles;

**WHEREAS**, Item 2 of the Special Provisions of the Approved Budget of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA), under the General Appropriations Act of the Bangsamoro (GAAB) appropriated for the current year, shall likewise be effective in the succeeding years for the Constituency Servicing Program (CSP) per Member of the Parliament, and shall be released upon their written request to the Finance Services;

**WHEREAS**, the same GAAB also approved an appropriation under the BTA for Financial Assistance/Subsidy (FAS);

**WHEREAS**, there are currently no guidelines on the utilization and liquidation of the CSP and FAS; hence, the BTA deems it appropriate to formalize such guidelines for the utilization and liquidation of the CSP and FAS by the Members of the Parliament;

**WHEREAS**, the Members of the Parliament are fully cognizant of their duty and responsibility to account to the public for the use and expenditure of public funds appropriated under their respective budgetary allocations in the GAAB, and have faithfully abided by the established auditing rules and regulations applicable to the legislature;

**WHEREAS**, in recognition of the delicate and unique nature of the functions, as well as the operational and organizational structures of the BTA, and in keeping with the nature of the performance by the Members of the Parliament and their respective committees of their legislative, oversight, and constituent functions and responsibilities, there is a need to establish appropriate guidelines and mechanisms tailored to such distinct circumstances:

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, To adopt the following policies on the accounting and liquidation of the Constituency Servicing Program (CSP) and Financial Assistance/Subsidy (FAS) per Member of the Parliament:

1. The liquidation of the respective budgetary allocations for the CSP and FAS of each Member of the Parliament shall be classified and processed in accordance with applicable accounting and auditing rules and regulations;

2. The liquidation of the amounts received by each Member of the Parliament shall be done through Liquidation by Way of Certification;

3. The Office of the Speaker of the Parliament shall issue necessary policies/guidelines, including the required forms, for the liquidation of the CSP and FAS; and

4. Each Member of the Parliament shall, in all cases, secure relevant documentary evidence of payments/disbursements from their CSP and FAS, which must be readily available for inspection and audit of the Commission on Audit when necessary.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, That this measure shall be effective unless otherwise revoked by the Honorable Members of the Parliament.

**RESOLVED, FINALLY**, To transmit a copy of this Resolution to the Office of the Speaker of the Parliament, for information and appropriate action.
