The Bangsamoro Government shall protect all persons from harassment or any undue pressure, coercion, and violence on account of religion;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Government promotes inclusivity and religious freedom within the region and maintains that schools and learning institutions are zones of peace where learners and faculty members must be safe at all times;
