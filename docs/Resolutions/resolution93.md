**RESOLUTION NO. 93**

**RESOLUTION URGING THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND THE SENATE OF THE PHILIPPINES TO EXTEND THE BARMM TRANSITION PERIOD TO JUNE 30, 2025 TO AFFORD THE BANGSAMORO TRANSITION AUTHORITY SUFFICIENT TIME TO CONTINUE IN PERFORMING ITS POWERS AND FUNCTIONS AND FULFILL ITS MANDATE**

**WHEREAS**, in recognition of the aspirations of the Bangsamoro people and other inhabitants in the autonomous region, the Filipino people, through the Congress of the Philippines, ordained and promulgated Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), to establish an enduring peace on the basis of justice, and to allow genuine and meaningful self-governance, among others;

**WHEREAS**, Section 1, Article XVI of the Bangsamoro Organic Law sets forth a Transition Period for the establishment of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region which commenced upon its ratification on January 21, 2019 through a plebiscite held for this purpose, and shall end upon the dissolution of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority;

**WHEREAS**, Section 12, Article XVI of the Bangsamoro Organic Law provides for the dissolution of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority immediately upon the election and qualification of the Chief Minister, following the first regular election for the Bangsamoro Government which shall be held and synchronized with the 2022 national elections;

**WHEREAS**, while the Bangsamoro Transition Authority has taken significant strides in its service as the interim government in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, the sheer weight of its mandate and the amount of work that it entails, coupled with shortfalls in resources and placed in the context of continued security threats, and further complicated by the effects of a lingering pandemic, the three-year transition period is simply not enough to accomplish its targets;

**WHEREAS**, the Mindanao People’s Caucus (MPC), in their “Rapid Midterm Review on the Bangsamoro Transition Period,” conducted through record reviews, key informant interviews and focused group discussions across various stakeholders, recommends the extension of the period of transition for another three years;

**WHEREAS**, in the said review, the MPC emphasized that the three-year extension to June 2025 is to allow the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) and the national government sufficient time to fully accomplish their priority tasks and duties, especially those that need to be jointly implemented;

**WHEREAS**, according to the aforementioned review, the pandemic practically robbed the Bangsamoro Transition Authority of the effective implementation of the transition to include its programs, projects and services;

**WHEREAS**, the 1996 Final Peace Agreement between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRP) and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) with the participation of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) has not yet been fully implemented including the Consensus Points of the Tripartite Review of the implementation of the 1996 Final Peace Agreement;

**WHEREAS**, Section 1, Article XIV of Republic Act No. 11054, which mandates for the rehabilitation and development of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front/Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Force members and its decommissioned women auxiliary force and the Moro National Liberation Front/Bangsamoro Armed Forces members has not been fully realized and implemented;

**WHEREAS**, the League of Municipalities of the Philippines (LMP), Tawi-Tawi Chapter, on July 2, 2020, passed Resolution No. 05 Series of 2020 entitled, “*a Resolution urging the Congress to enact a law providing for a sufficient transition period for the Bangsamoro Transition Authority to accomplish and complete the purpose for which it was created under R.A. 11054 by amending the first election of the Parliament from May 9, 2022 to May 12, 2025*”;

**WHEREAS**, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Tawi-Tawi, on July 14, 2020, passed Resolution No. 16-055 Series of 2020 entitled, “*a Resolution requesting the kind indulgence of the house of Congress to amend Republic Act No. 11054 also known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law to extend the transition period of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority therefor amending the first election of the Parliament from May 9, 2022 to May 2025*”;

**WHEREAS**, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Maguindanao, on October 15, 2019, passed Resolution No. 2019-329 entitled, “*a Resolution urging the congress to enact a law providing for a sufficient transition period for the Bangsamoro Transition Authority to accomplish and complete the purpose for which it was created under Republic Act No. 11054 by amending the first election of the Parliament from May 9, 2022 to May 2025*”;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to urge the House of Representatives and the Senate of the Philippines to extend the BARMM Transition Period to June 30, 2025 to afford the Bangsamoro Transition Authority sufficient time to continue in performing its powers and functions and fulfill its mandate.
