**RESOLUTION NO. 91**

**RESOLUTION STRONGLY CONDEMNING THE RAPE-SLAY OF SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD RASMIA KAMAWIT FROM BARANGAY MALANDUAGUE, KABACAN, COTABATO, AND EARNESTLY REQUESTING THE PHILIPPINE NATIONAL POLICE, THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION, AND THE COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS TO FAST-TRACK THE CONDUCT OF THEIR INVESTIGATION THEREON SO THAT THE PERPETRATORS OF THE DASTARDLY ACT CAN BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE**

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Organic Law (R.A. 11054) was enacted as an instrument of peace in addressing the grievances, sentiments, and demands of Moros in the region including the cessation of violence committed against civilians;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro People have overwhelmingly ratified the Bangsamoro Organic Law as a manifestation of their fervent hope and desire for self-determination with the end in view that the decades-old arm struggle will turn into responsive development beneficial to all stakeholders instead of needles sufferings that threaten their dignity as a people and human beings;

**WHEREAS**, the State ensures that all women shall be protected from all forms of violence. Agencies of government shall give priority to the defense and protection of women against gender-based offenses and help women attain justice and healing;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Government upholds and protects the fundamental rights of women against exploitation, abuse, or discrimination, as embodied in the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women;

**WHEREAS**, on September 13, 2020 (Monday), the body of the victim, Rasmia Kamawit, a 16-year old girl was found dumped dead on the Dalapuan River in Barangay Malanduague, Kabacan, Cotabato Province, a Bangsamoro Community outside Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), by her father searching for his missing daughter who ventured to gather firewood;

**WHEREAS**, the Kabacan Police Office has confirmed that Rasmia was also raped before she was murdered, and at least four suspects were named by the victim’s father as persons of interest in the commission of the crime, but their identity are still being withheld pending police investigation;

**WHEREAS**, this dastardly act makes a mockery of the Bangsamoro Government’s advocacy and efforts to ensure the promotion of the rights of women and girls and their protection from violence and abuses; it is an insult to the Bangsamoro Government that is determined to provide safe and secure communities for its people;

**WHEREAS**, the need for speedy rendition of justice is imperative especially that the senseless rape-slay was committed at a time of a wide spread calamity, a pandemic, besetting not only the country, but also the whole world;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Government must provide assistance to Bangsamoro communities outside BARMM, ensuring protection of their rights as well as enhancing their economic, social and cultural development;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved, to strongly condemn the rape-slay of sixteen-year-old Rasmia Kamawit from Barangay Malanduague, Kabacan, Cotabato, and earnestly request the Philippine National Police, the National Bureau of Investigation, and the Commission on Human Rights to fast-track the conduct of their investigation thereon so that the perpetrators of the dastardly act can be brought to justice.

**RESOLVED, FINALLY**, to forward this resolution to the Chief of the Philippine National Police, the Director of the National Bureau of Investigation, and the Chairperson of the Commission on Human Rights for appropriate action.
