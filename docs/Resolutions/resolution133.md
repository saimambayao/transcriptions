**RESOLUTION NO. 133**

**RESOLUTION URGING THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE BANGSAMORO INTER-AGENCY TASK FORCE ON COVID-19 TO COORDINATE CLOSELY WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNITS (LGU) IN A REGION-WIDE INFORMATION CAMPAIGN AT THE GRASS ROOTS LEVEL TO MOTIVATE THE BANGSAMORO PEOPLE TO REGISTER FOR AND RECEIVE THEIR COVID-19 VACCINATIONS**

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Government, pursuant to Moral Governance, must ensure that the health and safety of the Bangsamoro people residing in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) are protected and prioritized;

WHEREAS, community quarantines and other Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) protocols have been in effect since March 2020, or well over a year; and said limitations, although necessary to minimize mass transmission of the virus, have delayed creation of priority legislation as well as the socioeconomic development of the BARMM;

WHEREAS, it is also the duty of the Bangsamoro Government to facilitate, promote and accelerate the socioeconomic development of the Autonomous Region through proper containment and eventual eradication of the virus in the BARMM, in which herd immunity of the Bangsamoro people are necessary therefor;

WHEREAS, Section 8 on Social Justice of Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054, also known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), provides that the Bangsamoro Government is mandated to provide, maintain, and ensure “the delivery of basic and responsive health programs, as well as to “maintain appropriate disaster-preparedness units for immediate and effective relief services to victims of natural and man-made calamities,” such as the COVID-19 pandemic;

WHEREAS, Sec. 3 of Article V and Section 22 of Article IX of the BOL, basically provide that the Bangsamoro Government is duty-bound to protect and promote the health and safety of the Bangsamoro people, and that it shall even “adopt a policy on health that provides for a comprehensive and integrated health services delivery for its constituents”;

WHEREAS, under Section 2, Chapter 1, Title V of Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 13 (BAA No. 13), otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Administrative Code (BAC), the Ministry of Health - BARMM is “primarily responsible for the formulation, planning, implementation and coordination of policies and programs for health” and it is also tasked to “promote, protect, preserve and restore the health of the people through the provision and delivery of health services through regulation and encouragement of providers of health goods and services”;

WHEREAS, Sec. 21 of Chapter 6, Title V of BAA No. 13, provides more particularly that the Infectious Disease Control Unit is tasked to “formulate plans, policies, programs, standards and techniques relative to the control of communicable diseases”, including COVID-19, as well as to “provide consultative, training and advisory services to implementing agencies; and conduct studies and research related to these other communicable diseases”;

WHEREAS, the Ministry of Health (MOH) - BARMM has been allocated P500 Million for the procurement of vaccines on top of P380 Million which was set aside for its COVID-19 Response Plan;

WHEREAS, the MOH - BARMM, on the other hand, is indefinitely prohibited from purchasing any COVID-19 vaccines since the National Government has been allocating vaccines to the Region based on the number of people registered for vaccination;

WHEREAS, further data gathered from the MOH - BARMM has revealed that only a minimal percentage of the Bangsamoro people have been vaccinated as an estimated forty-two thousand (42,000) people or one percent (1%) of approximately 3.8 million of the population in the BARMM have received and/or registered for vaccinations at the time of drafting this resolution.

WHEREAS, according to information obtained from the Department Of Health (DOH) of the National Government and the MOH - BARMM, the allocation of COVID-19 vaccines from the National Government to BARMM is correlative to or dependent on the number of Bangsamoro who have actually registered to receive the vaccine;

WHEREAS, there is clearly a poor turn out of the Bangsamoro people who want to receive vaccinations, so there should be an information and education campaign (IEC) at the grass roots or barangay level aimed encouraging vaccination to increase the number of registrants as well as to dispel their fears and rumors about the vaccine; possibly through an incentive program among relevant the agencies, such as an assistance program coordinated with the Ministry of Social Services and Development (MSSD) for those who have registered and received their complete 2-dose COVID-19 vaccinations;

WHEREAS, pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph, the number of Bangsamoro who will register to receive the vaccine would definitely increase, allowing for a bigger allocation of COVID-19 vaccines from the National Government to the BARMM and possible achievement of herd immunity in the Region after the roll-out of the vaccines.

NOW, THEREFORE, be it

RESOLVED, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to urge the Bangsamoro Government through the Bangsamoro Inter-Agency Task Force on COVID-19 to coordinate closely with Local Government Units (LGU) in a region-wide information campaign at the grass roots level to motivate the Bangsamoro people to register for and receive their COVID-19 vaccinations.

RESOLVED, FINALLY, to forward the foregoing Resolution to the Bangsamoro Inter-Agency Task Force on COVID-19, Ministry of Interior and Local Government-BARMM and MOH-BARMM for further information and appropriate consideration.

ADOPTED, June 24, 2021.
