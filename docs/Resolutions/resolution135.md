**RESOLUTION NO. 135**

**RESOLUTION EXPRESSING THE SENTIMENTS AND CONSENSUS OF THE BANGSAMORO PARLIAMENT ON THE GRANT OF AN AWARD OF RECOGNITION AND COMMENDATION TO SECRETARY ABDULLAH D. MAMA-O AS AN EXEMPLAR OF MUSLIM FILIPINO LEADERSHIP AND OF ISLAMIC DIPLOMACY**

WHEREAS, it is fit and proper for this Parliament to express recognition of certain deserving individuals especially fellow Bangsamoro, like Secretary Abdullah Derupong Mama-o, who at the moment is the only Bangsamoro Muslim Filipino with Cabinet rank as Presidential Adviser on Overseas Filipino Workers; he is also designated as Special Envoy of the President for the State of Kuwait who, besides, serves from time to time upon the direction of the President not only promoting national interest in international arena but even in domestic field especially to fellow Bangsamoro constituents where he gives financial, technical, medical, legal and other assistance as a consequence of his official position;

WHEREAS, being the only Bangsamoro Muslim with Cabinet rank and his close association with His Excellency President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, he was sometimes assign to help or assist Bangsamoro problems both here and abroad;

WHEREAS, it is worth taking into account that the many international missions entrusted to him by the President all came out with sterling results, to cite a few:

(a) *The successful resolution in 2016 for the repatriation of a great majority of an estimated 11,000 stranded OFWs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia occasioned by the financial problems of big Saudi construction companies, through cooperative action with other agencies particularly the Public Attorneys' Office (PAO) and where, among others, he personally convinced a desperate group of 300 OFWs to return home (they had assaulted some Embassy people before);*

(b) *His use of personal Islamic diplomacy in Kuwait to resolve both the two phases of bilateral diplomatic crises between the Philippines and Kuwait spawned by the murders of domestic helpers Joanna Demafelis (found in early 2018) and Jeanelyn Villavende (in December 2019) wherein he served as the Philippine neutral reconciler of the non-congruent positions of the then DFA Sec. Cayetano and DOLE Sec. Bello by directly negotiating at the highest levels with Kuwaiti officialdom to significantly help resolve the Demafelis phase by May 2018 even as he saved the three DFA officers criminally charged by Kuwaiti authorities, and wherein through Islamic diplomacy, again at the highest levels, he blunted the labor-only based virulent actions by DOLE/POEA arising from the second phase out of the Villavende murder and successfully pushed for the signing of the actionable addendum agreement guaranteeing the rights of Filipino domestic workers in Kuwait;*

(c) *He caused the release and return to the Philippines in 2019 from Libya of 7 Filipino seamen of M/T Levante accused of oil smuggling and imprisoned since 2017, as well as of 3 Filipino water engineers kidnapped in Southwest Libya in July 2018; the President had called on Secretary Mama-o to negotiate for the release of the 3 engineers when news of their kidnapping became known; of the many Cabinet level officials who had been allowed to help, only Secretary Mama-o was successful in reaching Tripoli in the midst of high caliber exchange of canon fire between the warring factions in the Libyan civil war; he met with the UN-recognized government officials from the President to the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Labor, Justice and Health; at these highest levels, using personal Islamic diplomacy, Secretary Mama-o brought up the cases of the 7 Seamen and 3 Engineers; several times he went to Libya for this cause in 2018 and 2019 each time with danger to life and limb to himself and his companion, now Ambassador to Kuwait Noordin Lomondot, with such dangers ranging from getting their civilian plane shot down to being gunned down by bandits or Libyan factions in day or night car travels in isolated desert roads to Tunisia through many “checkpoints”; in March 2019 the 7 Engineers, as a result of Sec. Mama-o’s representations with the Libyan President and Min. of Justice, were acquitted by the Libyan High Court and were repatriated by their shipping company; on May 18, 2019 the three kidnapped engineers arrived in Manila, after a combined secret operation of the Libyan National Army (LNA) under Field Marshal Khalifa B. Haftar and the UAE [which supports the Tobruk-based LNA]; the LNA controlled the area where the kidnappers held their victims, and it turns out that the South Korean Foreign Minister had talks on these victims with a UAE Prince during an international event, and thanks to Sec. Mama-o’s consistent coordination with his South Korean counterpart for a “one for all, all for one” approach to negotiations for the release of the Korean managing engineer and the 3 Filipino water engineers, all the 4 were sprung from their kidnappers’ hideout together;*

(d) *Secretary Mama-o strongly argued with the DFA and the National Security Council for the provision of legal defense from the start for the Qatar 7 (seven Muslim Filipinos from Lanao detained in Doha for alleged terrorist links), Secretary Mama-o reminded the DFA of the constitutional guarantee of the right by all citizens to have an attorney;*

(e) *Secretary Mama-o, as head of the Presidential Mission Team sent by the President to the Middle East, [during the near war situation between US and Iran in January-February 2020 due the drone assassination in early January near Baghdad airport of long-time head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards’ Quds Force, Major General Qassim Suleimeni] obtained from the leaders of Iran, Iraq, Qatar, Kuwait, UAE, Bahrain and Turkey assurances and commitments for the provisions of help in protection and safe passage for Filipinos needing to evacuate in case of war and other calamities; friendliness as members of the global Ummah celebrated the Islamic Diplomacy in these high level encounters, marked by fraternal embrace and other declarations of humanitarian support necessitated by the intervention of Secretary Mama-o; and*

(f) *Secretary Mama-o facilitated and secured the grant by the President of conditional pardons in 2020 for 2020 Emirati Nationals that in exchange generated the absolute pardon by the UAE Presidency of 51 Filipino convicts in UAE who were deported and sent back to the Philippines at UAE expense;*

WHEREAS, this august Parliament believes that giving recognition to praiseworthy Bangsamoro citizens gives a positive model for our young to emulate, so that they themselves shall become worthy of liberties.

NOW, THEREFORE, be it

RESOLVED, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to express the sentiments and consensus of the Bangsamoro Parliament on the grant of an award of recognition and commendation to Secretary Abdullah D. Mama-o as an exemplar of Muslim Filipino Leadership and of Islamic Diplomacy.

RESOLVED, FURTHER, to furnish copy of this Resolution to the Office of the President and the Office of Secretary Abdullah D. Mama-o, Malacañan Palace, Manila, for their information and guidance.

ADOPTED, July 13, 2021.
