**RESOLUTION NO. 114**

**RESOLUTION COMMENDING THE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, CULTURAL AND POLITICAL ACHIEVEMENTS OF WOMEN IN THE BANGSAMORO AS THE AUTONOMOUS REGION JOINS THE WORLD IN THE CELEBRATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY ON MARCH 8, 2021**

**WHEREAS**, the International Women’s Day is a global celebration of women’s achievements, raising awareness about women’s equality, and calling for accelerating gender parity. The celebration of women’s achievements helps forge equality, combat gender bias and discrimination, and can impact positive change for women;

**WHEREAS**, in recognition of the important role of women in nation-building and regional development, the Bangsamoro Organic Law has adopted the policy to uphold and protect their fundamental rights, including the right of women to engage in lawful employment, and to be protected from exploitation, abuse, or discrimination, as embodied in the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW);

**WHEREAS**, towards this end, training programs are conducted in the region to get women ready not only to become advocates but also to “sit at the table” if necessary. Many capacity-building activities are likewise being conducted in the region to inform women about the content of national and international laws particularly relevant to the situation of women, specifically the Magna Carta for Women and the CEDAW;

**WHEREAS**, in fact, the signing of the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro, which concluded 17 years of negotiations between the Philippine Government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, was hailed by many for its strong provisions on women’s rights as well as for women’s political, social and economic participation;

**WHEREAS**, the peace process made women’s participation possible through the transformation of the political, economic and social structures that used to perpetuate injustice and deprivation;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Government continues to build an enabling environment for the participation of women, establish appropriate mechanisms for consultations with women, and implement special development programs and laws for women;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Parliament asserts its commitment to recognize women’s participation, whether in official government roles or through grassroots efforts, in contributing to lasting peace agreements;

**NOW, THEREFORE**, be it

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to commend the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women in the Bangsamoro as the autonomous region joins the world in the celebration of the International Women’s Day on March 8, 2021.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, to forward this Resolution to the Office of the Bangsamoro Women Commission, for information and appropriate consideration.

**ADOPTED**, March 17, 2021.
