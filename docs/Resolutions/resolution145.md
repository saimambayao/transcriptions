**THIRD REGULAR SESSION**

**RESOLUTION NO. 145**

**RESOLUTION REQUESTING THE PHILIPPINE NATIONAL POLICE (PNP) AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) TO EXPEDITE THE INVESTIGATION ON THE KIDNAPPING AND BRUTAL MURDER OF NADIA CASAR AND EVENTUALLY BRING THE PERPETRATORS TO JUSTICE**

WHEREAS, on July 20, 2021, Bangsamoro Businesswoman Nadia Casar, together with her hired Grab driver were abducted by armed men in Nueva Ecija, but the latter was later on released after forcibly taking his money and cellphone;

WHEREAS, on August 1, 2021, more than a week after the incident, the burned remains of Nadia Casar were discovered by the authorities in a shallow grave in Sitio Pinagpala, Barangay Imelda Valley, Palayan City;

WHEREAS, upon investigation, the Grab driver acting as witness identified five (5) policemen and two (2) civilians as alleged culprits in the felonious abduction and savage killing of Nadia Casar;

WHEREAS, PNP Chief Gen. Guillermo Eleazar immediately directed the Internal Affairs Service of the PNP to initiate the summary dismissal proceedings against the five (5) policemen involved and tasked the Anti-Kidnapping Group (AKG) and the Integrity Monitoring and Enforcement Group to pursue the arrest of the remaining suspects still at large;

WHEREAS, the incident sparked outrage in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) as it is reprehensible and inconceivable that those who are sworn to protect the innocent civilians are the ones who stand as suspects to said atrocious and inhuman acts;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Parliament saw the necessity of urging the concerned sectors or agencies of the government for the speedy resolution of the case so that those who carried out these serious crimes will finally be brought to justice, let alone that fairness, equality and justice still hold on upon the minority groups of this country;

NOW, THEREFORE, be it

RESOLVED, by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, as it is hereby resolved, to request the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to expedite the investigation on the kidnapping and brutal murder of Nadia Casar and eventually bring the perpetrators to justice.

RESOLVED, FURTHER, to forward this Resolution to all concerned for their information and immediate appropriate action.

ADOPTED, Muharram 15, 1443/August 24, 2021.
