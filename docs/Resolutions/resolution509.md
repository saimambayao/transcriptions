**PARLIAMENT RESOLUTION NO. 509**

**RESOLUTION REQUESTING THE MINDANAO DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY TO APPRISE THE BANGSAMORO TRANSITION AUTHORITY PARLIAMENT ON THE STATUS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MINDANAO RIVER BASIN MASTER PLAN, ESPECIALLY ON THE IDENTIFIED PRIORITY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS**

**WHEREAS**, with a total catchment area of twenty-one thousand five hundred three (21,503) square kilometers, the Mindanao River Basin (MRB) is the current largest river basin in the country encompassing large areas of three regions in Central Mindanao: Regions X, XII, and Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), and that the national government plans for the effective and efficient management and development of the river basin and its resources;

**WHEREAS**, for this purpose, a Master Plan for the river basin has been formulated. The plan preparation has been undertaken through the consultancy services of Woodfield Consultants, Inc. from 2010 to 2012 with the support of the Department of Public Works and Highways, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), the Department of the Interior and Local Government, the National Irrigation Administration, and the Office of Civil Defense (OCD). As stated, the study sought for the long-term rehabilitation and development of the river basin;

**WHEREAS**, in support of the Master Plan, three Regional Development Councils (RDCs) in Mindanao, namely the RDC 10, the RDC 12, and the Regional Economic and Development Planning Board-BARMM of the former Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, now BARMM, endorsed the implementation of the MRB Master Plan, paving the way for its operationalization and the eventual creation of an institution that will manage, rehabilitate, and develop the river basin and its resources;

**WHEREAS**, it may be recalled that in July 2011, Executive Order No. 50, Series of 2011, transferred the tasks and functions of the Presidential Task Force on Mindanao River Basin Rehabilitation and Development to regular government agencies, which include Mindanao Development Authority, DENR River Basin Control Office, and National Risk Reduction Management Council-OCD;

**WHEREAS**, the proposed river basin council will be composed of representatives from the concerned provincial and local government units (LGUs), the national government agencies, the river basin and LGU alliances, the non-governmental organizations, and the private sectors. This setup ensures that all efforts and initiatives to rehabilitate and develop the river basin are well-coordinated with a cohesiveness of objectives;

**WHEREAS**, as stated in the Master Plan, the concerns of the river basin with development programs and project components include water resources and watershed management, flood control alongside disaster risk reduction and hazard management, wetland management, economic development, institutional linkages, and an organizational structure for the River Basin Management;

**WHEREAS**, given its adequate executive and legislative powers and authority, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament is in a better position to provide policy measures and legislative support to the successful implementation of the River Basin Master Plan, including the implementation and operationalization of development programs and projects designed for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, hence the importance to brief and update the Parliament about the status of the River Basin Master Plan:

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, To request the Mindanao Development Authority to apprise the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament on the status of the implementation of the Mindanao River Basin Master Plan, especially on the identified priority development programs and projects.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, To forward this Resolution to the Mindanao Development Authority, for information.
