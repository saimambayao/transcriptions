**SECOND REGULAR SESSION**

**RESOLUTION NO. 84**

**RESOLUTION REQUESTING THE SECURITY SECTOR IN THE MOST AFFECTED AREAS/GROUND ZERO IN MARAWI CITY TO PROHIBIT THE TREATING OF THE AREA AS TOURIST SPOT**

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) Parliament in its promotion and protection of the general welfare of its constituents is seeking to adopt a policy to address a situation which impacts on the cultural sensitivities of the proud people of the Lake in Marawi City, Lanao del Sur;

**WHEREAS**, the infamous Marawi Siege has brought Marawi City and the Maranaos horrendous plight never before seen in the annals of Mindanao;

**WHEREAS**, the aftermath of the Battle in Marawi City has scarred the psyche of its residents and left the downtown area plainly unrecognizable;

**WHEREAS**, as shown in some social media postings, Task Force Bangon Marawi has allowed people, whether residents or visitors, access to the most affected area;

**WHEREAS**, in this process, visitors have taken to a variety of social media platforms seemingly trivializing the magnitude of the sorrow brought by the events and treating the same as a “tourist spot akin to a post-apocalyptic theme park”;

**WHEREAS**, the Parliament acknowledges the importance of documentation and other important processes and activities in relation to the Rehabilitation of Marawi and the publishing of the same as constant reminder of the need to hasten rehabilitation and reparation.

**NOW, THEREFORE**, be it

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the BTA, to request the security sector in the most affected areas/ground zero in Marawi city to prohibit the treating of the area as tourist spot, taking of photos and other activities by visitors in a manner, such as selfies and groupies, or in any other manner tending to devalue the events that transpired inside the most affected area and adding insult to the injury suffered by the people of Marawi City.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, to forward the foregoing Resolution to the head of Task Force Bangon Marawi, The Commander of the Security Sector, The City Mayor of Marawi City, and Provincial Governor of Lanao del Sur, all in Marawi City.

Adopted, July 23, 2020.
