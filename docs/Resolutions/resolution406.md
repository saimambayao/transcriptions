**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao is a new political entity created in 2019 by virtue of Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL);

**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Article IV of the BOL provides that in the exercise of its right to self-governance, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is free to pursue its political, economic, social and cultural development as provided for in the Organic Law;

**WHEREAS**, Section 3, Article V of the BOL provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants;

**WHEREAS**, under Section 2, Article XVI of the BOL, it is stated that the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) shall be the interim government in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region during the transition period;

**WHEREAS**, Section 4 (a) of the same article mandates the BTA to ensure, among others, the enactment of priority legislations such as the Bangsamoro Administrative Code, Bangsamoro Revenue Code, Bangsamoro Electoral Code, Bangsamoro Local Government Code, Bangsamoro Civil Service Code, Bangsamoro Educational Code, and the Indigenous Peoples Law consistent with powers vested in the Bangsamoro Government by the BOL;

**WHEREAS**, in a statement by Chief Minister Ahod “Murad” B. Ebrahim on July 15, 2019 in Cotabato City, he said that *“the only way to realize the aspiration of the decades-struggle of the Bangsamoro people is to be able to achieve the changes we want in the governance;”*

**WHEREAS**, the passing of the priority codes is necessary for the smooth operations of the Bangsamoro Government;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Parliament already enacted five (5) out of the seven (7) priority legislations, namely, the Administrative Code, the Civil Service Code, the Education Code, the Electoral Code, and the Local Governance Code. The Internal Revenue Code and Indigenous Peoples Code have yet to be passed;

**WHEREAS**, a comprehensive approach in disseminating the enacted priority codes is imperative as a means to raise the level of awareness of the Bangsamoro people;

**WHEREAS**, one of the best ways in disseminating the enacted priority codes is through printing and distribution of at least ten thousand (10,000) copies to the stakeholders, especially for the ministries, agencies and offices, and the local government units;

**WHEREAS**, in order to strengthen the harmony and linkages with the stakeholders, it is important to furnish them copies of the priority codes already adopted by the Bangsamoro Parliament to further educate and guide them:

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, To task the Office of the Secretary-General to print and distribute the priority laws passed by the Parliament.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, To forward this Resolution to the Office of the Secretary-General of the BTA Parliament, for information and appropriate action.
