**WHEREAS,** Sec. 2, Article IX on “Basic Rights” under the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao recognizes, as part of transitional justice, providing reparations to the Bangsamoro people affected by unjust dispossession of territorial and proprietary rights which may include payment of just compensation to and relocation of such people;

**WHEREAS,** there is a growing awareness that addressing past injustice is a crucial part of the process of healing and reconciliation in order to move towards a peaceful future, and one way is through compensation programs and reparations for the victims of injustice. Many note that issues of compensation and rehabilitation of victims should be incorporated into plans for post-conflict reconstruction and economic revitalization;

**WHEREAS,** in implementing a compensation program, when compensation is not fully available from the direct offender, states should endeavour to provide financial compensation;

**WHEREAS,** the Marawi Siege from May to October 2017 resulted to the deaths of more than a thousand individuals, displaced 98% of the city’s population and has left the city in ruins with 95% of the structures within the 4 square kilometers (1.5 sq. mi) of the main battle area heavily damaged or completely collapsed, 3,152 buildings were completely destroyed and 2,145 buildings sustained partial to heavy damage due to the five-month heavy bombardment during the war.

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to express support for the filing of House Bills No. 3543, 3418 and 3922 seeking for the passage of a law to provide monetary compensation for the losses suffered by the people of Marawi.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER,** to express this Parliament’s prayer for the consolidation of those bills and their swift enactment into law by the Congress.
