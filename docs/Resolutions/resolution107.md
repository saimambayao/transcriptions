**WHEREAS**, the Ministry of Health (MOH) shall be primarily responsible for the formulation, planning, implementation and coordination of policies and programs for health. It shall promote, protect, preserve and restore the health of the people through the provision and delivery of health services through regulation and encouragement of providers of health goods and services. [*Title V, Chapter 1, Section 2 of the Bangsamoro Administrative Code, or Bangsamoro Autonomy Act 13 (BAA 13)*];

**WHEREAS**, the Infectious Disease Control Unit shall formulate plans, policies, programs, standards, and techniques relative to the control of communicable diseases, specifically on the major causes or mortality and morbidity, such as Leprosy, Sexually Transmitted Infections, Filariasis, Tuberculosis, Schistosomiasis, Soil Transmitted Diseases, Dengue, Malaria including emerging diseases like Meningococcicimia, SARS, Avian Influenza, Corona Virus Disease and other infectious diseases; provide consultative, training, and advisory services to implementing agencies; and conduct studies and research related to these and other communicable diseases. (*Title V, Chapter 6, Section 21 of BAA 13, Emphasis and underscoring supplied*);

**WHEREAS**, the BARMM Government allotted P500 Million for COVID-19 vaccine procurement on top of the P380 Million set aside by the Ministry of Health for its COVID-19 response plan;

**WHEREAS**, according to a newspaper, MOH Officer-In-charge Dr. Ameril Usman, said that they have not entered yet into agreement with any pharmaceutical company for the supply of the vaccine;

**WHEREAS**, Minister Usman has further discussed that the Ministry is still in the process of identifying which vaccine will work in the BARMM, that suits the environment and situation in addition to the issue on storage capacity and the requirement of storing the vaccine in an extremely low temperature to preserve their efficacy;

**WHEREAS**, a well-planned and well-implemented vaccination program can rapidly normalize our lives particularly those belonging to lower income groups and to the most vulnerable families in BARMM and eventually ease their financial burden;

**WHEREAS**, considering the composition of the territories and constituencies of BARMM, there is a need to involve the Bangsamoro Parliament in the initial discussions on the programs’ logistics in order to ensure that the vaccine’s distribution is based on a cohesive and collective decision made by the Bangsamoro Parliament as whole.

**NOW, THEREFORE**, be it

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to urgently direct the Ministry of Health to apprise the Bangsamoro Parliament on the assessment, plan and program on the distribution of covid-19 vaccine.

**RESOLVED, FINALLY**, to forward the foregoing Resolution to the Ministry of Health, BARMM, for information and appropriate consideration.
