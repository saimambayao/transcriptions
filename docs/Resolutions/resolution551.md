**RESOLUTION DIRECTING THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH TO INTENSIFY ITS PROGRAM FOR THE ELIMINATION OF TUBERCULOSIS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO**

**WHEREAS**, Section 5, Article II of the 1987 Constitution states that the maintenance of peace and order, the protection of life, liberty, and property, and the promotion of the general welfare are essential for the enjoyment by all the people of the blessings of democracy;

**WHEREAS**, Section 11 of the same Article provides that the State values the dignity of every human person and guarantees full respect for human rights;

**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Article IV of Republic Act No. 11054, also known as the *“Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (OLBARMM)”*, provides that in the exercise of its right to self-governance, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is free to pursue its political, economic, social, and cultural development, as provided for in this Organic Law;

**WHEREAS**, Section 3, Article V of the OLBARMM provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the powers expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance, and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants;

**WHEREAS**, Republic Act No. 10767, otherwise known as the *“Comprehensive Tuberculosis Elimination Plan Act”*, was enacted in 2016 to support and expand efforts to eliminate tuberculosis as a public health problem in the Philippines;

**WHEREAS**, tuberculosis, or TB refers to an infectious but curable disease caused by the bacterium called *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. It is transmitted from a TB patient to others through coughing, sneezing, and spitting. While the bacterium usually affects the lungs, it may also affect the bones and other organs such as the kidneys and liver;

**WHEREAS**, during the regional high-level meeting in collaboration with the Stop TB Partnership and the United States Agency for International Development held in Pasay City, Metro Manila, Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Ted Herbosa reported that a total of six hundred twelve thousand (612,000) TB cases were reported in 2023. This equates to approximately five hundred forty-nine (549) cases per one hundred thousand (100,000) population, marking an increase from four hundred thirty-nine (439) cases per one hundred thousand (100,000) in 2022;

**WHEREAS**, Dr. Lucica Ditiu, Executive Director of the Stop TB Partnership, also emphasized the urgency of addressing TB, stating, *“Tuberculosis – which is airborne – is not receiving as much attention as Coronavirus Disease 2019. We’re all at risk, regardless of color or religion;”*

**WHEREAS**, during the World TB Day on Friday, March 22, 2024, the DOH Officer in Charge Maria Rosario Vergeire stated that, although TB is curable, it still caused over one million six hundred thousand (1,600,000) deaths in 2021, and said that about seventy (70) Filipinos die from TB daily;

**WHEREAS**, she further stated that, *“We are only one (1) of the eight (8) countries that account for two-thirds (2/3) of the estimated global cases. The Philippines is also the fourth (4th) largest contributor of TB cases at seven percent (7%) of the global total. For every one hundred thousand (100,000) Filipinos, an estimated six hundred fifty (650) individuals were infected with TB in 2021, a huge difference from our five hundred fifty-four (554) per one hundred thousand (100,000) from the year prior;”*

**WHEREAS**, she also disclosed that the National Capital Region had reached its target treatment enrollment, followed by CALABARZON, Central Luzon, and Western Visayas with high enrollment rates, while the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) and the Cordillera Administrative Region continue to lag behind;

**WHEREAS**, the National Tuberculosis Control Program, organized in 1978 and operating within a devolved healthcare delivery system, is one of the public health programs for the management of TB. It is managed and coordinated by the Infectious Diseases for Prevention and Control Division of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the DOH;

**WHEREAS**, although TB primarily affects adults in their most productive years, all age groups are at risk;

**WHEREAS**, over eighty percent (80%) of TB cases and deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries;

**WHEREAS**, TB occurs in every part of the world. In 2022, the largest number of new TB cases was reported in the World Health Organization’s South-East Asian Region (46%), followed by the African Region (23%) and the Western Pacific Region (18%). Approximately eighty-seven percent (87%) of new TB cases occurred in the thirty (30) high TB burden countries, with more than two-thirds (2/3) of the global total reported in Bangladesh, China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, and the Philippines;

**WHEREAS**, the treatment for TB is very intensive, requiring oral antibiotics to be taken for a period of four (4) to six (6) months;

**WHEREAS**, there is an immediate need to intensify and strengthen the program for the elimination of TB in the BARMM;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, as the interim government of the BARMM, must take necessary actions and expand its efforts to eliminate TB or reduce its incidence and mortality rate in the region;

**WHEREAS**, this can be achieved by monitoring the status and progress of TB in the region and, most importantly, by intensifying the program and further developing strategies to combat the disease;

**WHEREAS**, in addition, the Ministry of Health (MOH) is encouraged to launch a multi-platform campaign to educate the public regarding the control, treatment, management, and other interventional measures so that every Bangsamoro may protect themselves against the disease:

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, to pass and approve this Resolution directing the Ministry of Health to intensify its program for the elimination of tuberculosis in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, To forward this Resolution to the MOH for information and immediate action.
