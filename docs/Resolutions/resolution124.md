**RESOLUTION NO. 124**

**RESOLUTION CONDEMNING VIOLENCE AGAINST PALESTINIANS BY ISRAELI FORCES TARGETING INNOCENT CIVILIANS INCLUDING WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND THE DESECRATION OF AL AQSA MOSQUE IN THE HOLY MONTH OF RAMADHAN AND URGING WORLD LEADERS TO ACT FOR THE IMMEDIATE CESSATION OF THE HOSTILITIES**

**WHEREAS,** according to the Amnesty International Report 2020-2021, Israel continued to impose institutionalized discrimination against Palestinians living under its rule in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) that caused the displacement of hundreds of Palestinians in Israel and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as a result of home demolitions and imposition of other coercive measures in the midst of the unprecedented human crisis that the world has ever known- the onslaught of the Corona Virus Disease (COVID 19);

**WHEREAS,** Israeli forces continued to use excessive force during law enforcement activities in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), thus resulting to the Israeli forces killing 31 Palestinians, including nine children, in the OPT; many were unlawfully killed while posing no imminent threat to life while Israel maintained its illegal blockade on the Gaza Strip, subjecting its residents to collective punishment and the deepening of the humanitarian crisis;

**WHEREAS,** furthermore, the Israeli forces continued to restrict freedom of movement of Palestinians in the OPT through checkpoints and roadblocks and the continuous arbitrary detention in Israel thousands of Palestinians from the OPT, holding hundreds in administrative detention without charge or trial by the Israeli authorities aside from torture involving of ill-treatment of detainees, including children, which were committed with impunity;

**WHEREAS,** moreover according to UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Israel have caused the demolition of 848 Palestinian residential and livelihood structures in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, displacing 996 people;

**WHEREAS,** this same cycle of violence and abuse continued and further aggravated as it occurred in the last days of the celebration of the holiest month in the Muslim Ummah, the month of Ramadhan, when more than 220 civilians were injured on the first night the violence erupted at the Al Aqsa Mosque and on the second night, some 121 Palestinians were wounded overnight, many hit by rubber-coated bullets and stun grenades;

**WHEREAS,** as the violence continued, perpetrated against peaceful protesters by Israeli Forces aggravated by the desecration of the Al Aqsa Mosque and the civilians exercising their basic right of free exercise of religion, a right internationally recognized and respected as customary law, the escalation of the violence certainly would lay more lives lost on the part of the Palestinians as compared Israel who is superior in all aspects primary of whom is its military might;

**WHEREAS,** world leaders have expressed concerns, however among these leaders, the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan deserve emulation whose words are not only a form of scripted expressions but an expression of true and genuine leader not only as a Muslim but as a human being, by stating the following statements:

*“Jerusalem is the world itself. And the Muslims there are humanity itself,”*

*"It is the duty of every individual who calls themselves a human being, to oppose tyrants that defile Jerusalem, home to the sacred for the three religions."*

*"We regard every attack on places of worship, chiefly Al-Aqsa, and on Muslims, as attacks made on us,"*

and further remarks endowing his being a Muslim by saying that,

*“protecting the honor and dignity of the holy city of Jerusalem was the duty of every Muslim and underlined that remaining silent or not taking a significant stand against the attacks by the state of Israel "is no different than supporting them" and "is accessory to the tyranny going on Palestinian lands;"*

**WHEREAS,** as Muslim leaders bestowed with the platform to express the Bangsamoro Transition Authority concern, it becomes imperative to call out such attacks and join the peace lovers around the world and the Muslim Ummah in speaking against this horrible acts.

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to condemn violence against the Palestinians by Israeli forces targeting innocent civilians including women and children and the desecration of Al Aqsa Mosque in the holy month of Ramadhan and urging world leaders to act for the immediate cessation of the hostilities.
