Pursuant to these principles, the Parliament shall enact laws pertaining to the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region economy and patrimony that are responsive to the needs of its people;

**WHEREAS**, Section 2 of the same Article of the Organic Law also states that the Bangsamoro Government shall promote the effective use of economic resources and endeavor to attain economic development that facilitates growth and full employment, human development, and social justice;

**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Article IV of the same Organic Law provides that in the exercise of its right to self-governance, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is free to pursue its political, economic, social, and cultural development;

**WHEREAS**, under Section 4, Article XVI of the Organic Law, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority is the interim government in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region which is mandated to organize the bureaucracy of the Bangsamoro Government during the transition, including the approval and implementation of a transition plan and the institution of a placement process for the hiring of personnel during transition;

**WHEREAS**, following the hiring process of the different ministries and offices of the Bangsamoro Government, a series of capacity-building activities and/or training for the hired personnel are conducted in order to equip them with the proper know-how and to enhance their competencies to be more effective in their public service delivery;

**WHEREAS**, under Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6713 or the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees, it is provided under Section 2 that it is the policy of the State to promote a high standard of ethics in public service. Public officials and employees shall at all times be accountable to the people and shall discharge their duties with utmost responsibility, integrity, competence, and loyalty, act with patriotism and justice, lead modest lives, and uphold public interest over personal interest;

**WHEREAS**, under Rule III, Section 2 of the Rules Implementing the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees (R.A. No. 6713), it is provided that:

> “Section 2. Professional, scientific, technical training and education programs shall enhance to the highest degree, professionalism, excellence, intelligence, and skills in the performance and discharge of duties and responsibilities of officials and employees. These programs shall be conducted in all offices of the government and may include subjects that are enumerated in the preceding section.”

**WHEREAS**, Section 4 of R.A. No. 6713 also provides for the norms of conduct of public officials and employees. Under paragraph (A) it is provided that:

> “Every public official and employee shall observe the following as standards of personal conduct in the discharge and execution of official duties:
>
> (a) **Commitment to public interest.** – Public officials and employees shall always uphold the public interest over and above personal interest. All government resources and powers of their respective offices must be employed and used efficiently, effectively, honestly, and economically, particularly to avoid wastage in public funds and revenues.
>
> (b) **Professionalism.** – Public officials and employees shall perform and discharge their duties with the highest degree of excellence, professionalism, intelligence, and skill. They shall enter public service with utmost devotion and dedication to duty. They shall endeavor to discourage wrong perceptions of their roles as dispensers or peddlers of undue patronage.”

**WHEREAS**, in relation to the lease of venue for official use, the Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. No. 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act is instructive: the location of the venue to be leased, which may refer to convention halls and hotels, should have been meticulously selected by the procuring entity, after taking into consideration, among others, the need for prudence and economy in government service and the suitability of the area in relation to the mandate of the office;

**WHEREAS**, given the following provisions, the funds of the Bangsamoro Government should be put into good use while investing in the skills of its employees;

**WHEREAS**, BTA Adopted Resolution No. 189 directs all ministries and offices of the Bangsamoro Government to conduct their capacity-building activities and other related activities within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in order to boost economic activities in the region;

**WHEREAS**, capacity-building activities and training should not be conducted in luxurious hotels and resorts anywhere in the country, except those which are externally funded (e.g. activities which are sponsored by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) or development partners). This is in keeping with the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards of each government official and employee, to use government resources efficiently and to avoid wastage of public funds. There is no need for these capacity-building activities or training to be held in expensive venues such as luxurious hotels or resorts, given that there are more conducive venues to hold them at a much lesser cost to the Bangsamoro Government and its people;

**WHEREAS**, existing laws, rules, and regulations mandating the judicious and prudent use of government funds must continue to ensure that no irregular, unnecessary, extravagant, excessive, and unconscionable expenses be incurred by the government:
