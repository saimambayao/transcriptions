**THIRD REGULAR SESSION**

**RESOLUTION NO. 165**

**RESOLUTION ENCOURAGING THE APPROPRIATE MINISTRIES OF THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT TO INSTALL MEMORIAL GATES, ARCHES, ROAD AND GATEWAY SIGNAGES AT THE ENTRY AND EXIT POINTS WITHIN THE BANGSAMORO REGION TO HELP RAISE AWARENESS OF THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO TERRITORY AND ITS CULTURE, TRADITION AND LAWS**

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro autonomy plebiscite took place on January 21 and February 6, 2019, which increased the BARMM territory with areas that were formerly of Region 12 (SOCCSKSARGEN);

WHEREAS, most people are not aware of the borders between the cities, municipalities, and provinces within the Bangsamoro, and some of the people from newly integrated areas are not aware that they are already in the Bangsamoro;

WHEREAS, aside from subsisting national laws, there are also Shari’ah laws and IP customs and traditions in place, which must also be followed within the Bangsamoro;

WHEREAS, the use of memorial gates, arches, road and gateway signages at the region’s territory borders and local government (city/municipality) boundaries provides several benefits, such as educating visitors about local attractions and amenities, provide directions for travelers, facilitating interaction between tourists and the local business community, sharing important local information, enhancing the overall visitor experience and promoting the locality’s art and cultural heritage;

WHEREAS, installing such structures in the region lets both residents and tourists know that they have entered/exited the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, encourages basic awareness of BARMM’s autonomous set-up and the existence of Shari’ah laws and IP customs and traditions, and promotes local tourism and art:

NOW, THEREFORE, be it

RESOLVED, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to encourage the appropriate ministries of the Bangsamoro government to install memorial gates, arches, road and gateway signages at the entry and exit points within the Bangsamoro region to help raise awareness of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao territory and its culture, tradition and laws.

RESOLVED FURTHER, that the Ministry of Interior and Local Government and the Ministry of Public Works in coordination with the Ministry of Trade, Investment and Tourism and the Bangsamoro Commission for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage (BCPCH) be encouraged to build such memorial gates, arches, road and gateway signages at the identified entry and exit points, incorporating the locality’s cultural heritage in the design of such structures

RESOLVED FINALLY, to forward this Resolution to the MILG, MPW, MTIT and BCPCH, for information and appropriate consideration.
