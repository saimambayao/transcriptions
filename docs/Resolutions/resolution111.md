**RESOLUTION NO. 111**

**RESOLUTION DIRECTING THE BANGSAMORO DARUL-IFTA’ OF THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM) TO CONDUCT AN ULAMA CONSULTATION/ CONFERENCE PURPOSELY TO DISCUSS MATTERS CONCERNING THE 2021 RAMADAN MOON SIGHTING AND COME UP ANNUALLY WITH UNIFIED DECLARATION FOR THE STARTING DAY OF FASTING (SAWM)**

**WHEREAS**, the Ramadan crescent for 2021 is expected to shape/form on April 12, 2021 according to Ibrahim Al Qarwan, member of the Arab Union for Astronomy and Space Sciences, and therefore, Ramadan is expected to begin on Tuesday, April 13, 2021;

**WHEREAS**, in the Philippines, particularly the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, there is urgent need for an Ulama consultation/conference under BARMM provinces and the Ulama from the Bangsamoro Community outside the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in order that they can agree and subsequently come up with a unified schedule of moon sighting and declaration for the starting day of the Ramadan 2021;

**WHEREAS**, Ramadan is not just for fasting but is likewise to reinforce Muslim unity and empathy. Thus, there is a need to reiterate its importance among the 13 ethnolinguistic groups and burgeoning religious diversity;

**WHEREAS**, it is understood that the establishment of the Regional Darul-Ifta’ (RDI) is a mean for the adoption of legal framework and uniformed standards in observing the Hilal (crescent) of Ramadan in the Bangsamoro region;

**WHEREAS**, the issue on moon sighting and commencing the fasting in the month of Ramadan has often factionalized the Islamic denomination and fragmented the Muslim Ummah due to the absence of consultation, consensus and adherence to general public’s good and equity;

**WHEREAS**, in view of the foregoing premises, the Bangsamoro Darul-Ifta’ should take initiative and grab opportunity to convene the Ulama of Bangsamoro for consultation so as to forge consensus on the issue of moon sighting for determining the month of Ramadan and to form linkages and collaboration among all religious sectors and major Muslim organizations in the country;

**NOW, THEREFORE**, be it

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to direct the Bangsamoro Darul-Ifta’ of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to conduct an Ulama Consultation/ Conference purposely to discuss matters concerning the 2021 Ramadan Moon Sighting and come up annually with Unified Declaration for the Starting Day of Fasting (SAWM).

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, to forward this Resolution to the office of Bangsamoro Darul-Ifta’, for information and appropriate consideration.

**ADOPTED**, March 17, 2021.
