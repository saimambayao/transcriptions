**WHEREAS**, Section 4, Article II of the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines states in part that *“The prime duty of the Government is to serve and protect the people”*;

**WHEREAS**, Doctor Marivic Tello, an obstetrician-gynecologist practitioner and the wife of former Provincial Police Director of Maguindanao, Retired Police General Agustin Tello, was reported missing on July 23, 2023, and was last seen at the Cotabato Regional and Medical Center (CRMC);

**WHEREAS**, on July 27, 2023, the body of Dr. Tello was found buried in the Cotabato Medical Society Building, inside the CRMC compound, and it is believed that she was killed within the hospital premises;

**WHEREAS**, on the same date, her secretary surrendered to the police authorities, and thereupon voluntarily confessed and admitted to murdering the said doctor which happened inside the CRMC compound;
