**THIRD REGULAR SESSION**

**RESOLUTION NO. 142**

**RESOLUTION URGING THE AVOIDANCE OF THE UTTERANCE OF PROFANITY ESPECIALLY WORDS THAT DEGRADE WOMEN**

WHEREAS, under Section 2 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6713 known as the Norms of Conduct of Public Officials and Employees, it is the policy of the state to promote a high standard of ethics in public service;

WHEREAS, under Section 4 of the said law, every public official and employee shall observe the standard of personal conduct in the discharge and execution of official duties, one of which is to refrain from doing acts in contrary to law, good morals, good customs, public policy, public order, public safety and public interest;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro culture regards the use of profanity as taboo and contrary of good moral and custom, most especially the utterance of “*putang ina*”. Because it involves women, mothers in particular, the person revered most in this world. It is also part of our belief that by using the offensive words, we may gain the wrath of God;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Government’s primary focus is on Moral Governance grounded on Moral uprightness.

WHEREAS, our beloved Prophet Muhammad *Sallallaho Alayhi Wassalam* (S.A.W.) said: “Verily, I was not sent to invoke curses, but rather I was only sent as a mercy.” In another hadith, using foul language and cursing is a sin, even in jest way and this is a characteristic of the people of hellfire; furthermore, our role model Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.) was sent to complete the system of good moral values;

WHEREAS, under Section 11 of the R.A. No. 6713, any public official or employee regardless of whether or not he holds office or employment in a temporary, permanent, or regular capacity, committing in violation of the said act shall be punished with a fine not exceeding the equivalent of six (6) month salary, suspension not exceeding one year, or removal depending on the gravity of the offense.

NOW, THEREFORE, be it

RESOLVED, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA), to urge the avoidance of the utterance of profanity especially words that degrade women.

RESOLVED, FURTHER, to avoid and refrain from the use of profanity or foul language as it is against the law and the law of God and to respectfully request the Office of the Chief Minister to direct the members of the Cabinet as a responsible in the awareness and implementation of this resolution.

RESOLVED, FINALLY, to forward this Resolution to the Office of the Chief Minister Hon. Ahod B. Ebrahim, for information and appropriate consideration.
