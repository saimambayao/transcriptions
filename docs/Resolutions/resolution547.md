**FOURTH REGULAR SESSION**

**PARLIAMENT RESOLUTION NO. 547**

**RESOLUTION RESPECTFULLY URGING THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, FERDINAND ROMUALDEZ MARCOS, JR. TO INCLUDE AS A PRIORITY LEGISLATION THE CREATION OF A DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS AND HIGHWAYS REGIONAL OFFICE, BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO AND THE FIVE NEW DISTRICT ENGINEERING OFFICES, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**WHEREAS**, Republic Act No. 11054, also known as the *“Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao”* establishes the framework for genuine autonomy in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), while mandating the continued support and cooperation of the National Government, particularly in areas such as infrastructure and national development programs;

**WHEREAS**, infrastructure is a critical component in promoting inclusive growth, peacebuilding, and disaster resilience in the Bangsamoro Region, yet access to quality public infrastructure remains limited, particularly in geographically isolated and conflict-affected areas;

**WHEREAS**, while the Bangsamoro Government, through its Ministry of Public Works (MPW-BARMM), manages infrastructure funded by the regional government, nationally funded infrastructure projects remain under the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), with implementation often coursed through regional offices located outside the Bangsamoro Region;

**WHEREAS**, the absence of a dedicated DPWH Regional Office for BARMM may contribute to recurring challenges in the delivery of national infrastructure programs in the region, such as implementation delays, misalignment with regional priorities, inter-agency coordination issues, and difficulty in responding to urgent needs on the ground;

**WHEREAS**, the provision of the Republic Act No. 11054 mandates that the construction and repair of national highways and roads are the primary responsibility of the national government, through the Department of Public Works and Highways. The DPWH is requested to immediately implement by all modalities the construction and repair of all national roads and bridges within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS**, Article XIII, Section 37 of Republic Act No. 11054 provides that the National Government shall fund and implement the construction and maintenance of the national roads, bridges, water supply and services, and flood control and irrigation systems and for the maintenance of the existing airports, seaports, and wharves in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region: *Provided*, That with regard to water supply and services, flood control and irrigation systems that connect or from facilities outside the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, there shall be cooperation and coordination between the Bangsamoro Government and the appropriate national or local government bodies. All national roads and bridges in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region shall be included in the National Road Network Information System. Nationally funded infrastructure projects shall be implemented by the National Government.

The Bangsamoro Government shall submit proposals to the appropriate national government agency for the inclusion of the cost of such maintenance in the latter’s budget that shall be submitted to the Congress of the Philippines for inclusion in the General Appropriations Act. Funding for national roads, bridges, and irrigation systems shall be regularly released to the relevant departments of the National Government;

**WHEREAS**, local stakeholders have experienced instances of confusion in implementation responsibilities, particularly where project oversight is split between national agencies and regional ministries, resulting in gaps in service delivery, delayed construction timelines, and difficulties in addressing maintenance and emergency repair needs;

**WHEREAS**, recent disruptions in access caused by ongoing or delayed national infrastructure projects—including bridges and national roads—have shown the need for faster and more responsive coordination between DPWH and BARMM ministries, particularly in times of flooding, disaster, or seasonal road wear;

**WHEREAS**, Senate Bill No. 2756, authored in the Senate, proposes to create a dedicated DPWH Regional Office for BARMM and establish five (5) new District Engineering Offices (DEOs) to ensure the effective and timely delivery of nationally funded infrastructure within the Bangsamoro Region;

**WHEREAS**, the establishment of a BARMM-based DPWH Regional Office would strengthen coordination with the MPW-BARMM, improve accountability in project implementation, and ensure that infrastructure programs are sensitive to the region’s unique terrain, security conditions, and development priorities;

**WHEREAS**, the creation of additional DEOs is crucial for expanding engineering and construction services to underserved areas, especially in remote mainland municipalities, the island provinces, and the Special Geographic Area, which are often excluded from direct DPWH services due to geographic and administrative barriers;

**WHEREAS**, certifying this proposed measure as urgent would affirm the commitment of the National Government to build institutional mechanisms that are responsive to the realities of autonomous governance in BARMM, and accelerate the passage of a law that could transform infrastructure delivery in the region:

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, To respectfully urge the President of the Republic of the Philippines, Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos, Jr. to include as a priority legislation the creation of a Department of Public Works and Highways Regional Office, Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao and the five new District Engineering Offices, appropriating funds therefor, and for other purposes.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, To furnish this Resolution to the Office of the President, the Senate of the Philippines, the House of Representatives, the Department of Public Works and Highways, the Bangsamoro Chief Minister, and the Ministry of Public Works–BARMM, for their appropriate information and action.

**ADOPTED**, Dhul Qa’dah 23, 1446/May 21, 2025.
