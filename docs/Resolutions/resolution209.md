**WHEREAS**, on October 28, 2021, the President of the Republic of the Philippines signed into law Republic Act No. 11593, resetting the first regular elections in the BARMM and synchronized the same with the 2025 national and local elections;

**WHEREAS**, Section 2 of R.A. No. 11593 provides that the Bangsamoro Transition Authority shall continue as the interim government but the President may appoint the eighty (80) new interim members of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, who shall serve up to June 30, 2025, or until their successors shall have been elected and qualified;

**WHEREAS**, on October 12, 2021, the BTA passed Resolution No. 173 entitled: “Resolution Respectfully Appealing to His Excellency President Rodrigo Roa Duterte to Allow the Incumbent Members of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority to Continue their Service, by Giving Primary Consideration in their Appointment”;

**WHEREAS**, to build stronger institutions for the BARMM, continuously deliver its commitments in relation to the previous peace agreements, establish a formidable BARMM governmental structure and robust policies, it is crucial that the incumbent members of the BTA nominated by the government panel be retained in the Parliament and be allowed to continue their service;

**WHEREAS**, this reappointment will not only be vital in effectively serving the Bangsamoro people, but also essential in continuing the present policies of the regional government, implementing its mandate and addressing the socio-economic crisis which burdened the people, especially those brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic;

**WHEREAS**, the incumbent members of the BTA invested valuable time and effort in discharging their functions as stated in R.A. No. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law, such as the enactment of priority codes, and also in making sure that they acquire the essential skills and knowledge to properly perform their duties and responsibilities in accordance with the said law;

**WHEREAS**, in pursuit of offering excellent delivery of public services in the Bangsamoro, the incumbent BTA Parliament Members and their staff equipped themselves with in-depth understanding of the parliamentary system and their role in the institution as a whole;

**WHEREAS**, for almost two years and a half, both local and international institutions and Non-Government Organizations invested time and effort for trainings and other capacity-building interventions to incumbent members of the BTA as to their roles in building an efficient and effective institution, and the processes or technicalities involved in a parliamentary system;

**WHEREAS**, the present membership of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority is characterized by a diverse yet ethnic-balanced composition, exemplified by proportional representation based on the Bangsamoro territorial jurisdiction, and aptly considering the BARMM provinces and all stakeholders such as various religious sectors, settler communities, non-Moro indigenous peoples, traditional leaders, academe, women, youth, peace advocates, former national government officials, members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), members of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), former officials of ARMM, technocrats, Career Executive Service eligible, and former BTC members who drafted the Bangsamoro Organic Law and are therefore repositories of the intent and spirit of the Bangsamoro Organic Law;

**WHEREAS**, there is a significant advantage in giving primary consideration to the incumbent Members of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority for reappointment on account of the experience, training, skills, knowledge, and wisdom that they have acquired, in addition to the legislations, policies, programs, and advocacies they pursued and accomplished in accordance with the transition plan and the peace process;

**WHEREAS**, by allowing them to continue their service and what they have started, the preservation of the momentum will have a positive effect in the institution as a whole in view of the eventual accomplishment of pending legislations, projects, and programs which are vital to the transition period;

**WHEREAS**, a disruption of service, which may have unintended consequences of restarting the whole operations, can be prevented by recognizing the importance of the continuity and stability of the transition;

**WHEREAS**, the President of the Republic of the Philippines has the sole power to appoint the Members of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority:

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to respectfully reiterate our appeal to His Excellency President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, should he decide to appoint the new set of members of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA), to allow the incumbent Members of the BTA who are nominated by the government to continue their service, by giving primary consideration in their re-appointment.
