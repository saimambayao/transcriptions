c) Lake Buluan Development Project;
d) Lake Lanao Fish Cage Project; and
e) Integrated Marine Fisheries Development Project.

WHEREAS, the comprehensive report shall also include other projects and assets of the SPDA;

WHEREAS, the status and condition of the aforementioned projects will have to be ascertained by the Bangsamoro Government, considering that these projects can either be assets or liabilities of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region that require policy measures and options;

WHEREAS, the Office of the Chief Minister may organize an Inter-Agency Task Group (IATG) that will assess and/or evaluate the status and condition of the aforementioned projects and make recommendations regarding the projects for appropriate action and decision of the Chief Minister;
