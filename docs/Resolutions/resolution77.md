**RESOLUTION NO. 77**

**RESOLUTION RESPECTFULLY APPEALING TO HIS EXCELLENCY PRESIDENT RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE TO VETO SENATE BILL NO. 1083 AND HOUSE BILL NO. 6875 OR THE ANTI-TERRORISM ACT OF 2020 TO PROVIDE CONGRESS THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW AND ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF VAGUENESS, OVERBREADTH AND OTHER CONCERNS**

WHEREAS, Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines states that: “The maintenance of peace and order, the protection of life, liberty, and property, and the promotion of the general welfare are essential for the enjoyment by all the people of the blessings of democracy”;

WHEREAS, there is a need to implement effective measures to prevent and counter terrorism, in all its forms, as such acts pose threats to human rights, democracy, and the rule of law;

WHEREAS, on February 29, 2020, the Senate of the Philippines approved Senate Bill No. 1083 otherwise known as the “Anti-Terrorism Bill of 2019”, seeking to revise the country’s anti-terrorism rules and to repeal Republic Act No. 9372, or the “Human Security Act of 2007”;

WHEREAS, the counterpart bill in the House of Representatives, House Bill No. 6875 adopted the Senate’s version, and was approved on third and final reading on June 3, 2020;

WHEREAS, the enrolled bill is now before the President awaiting his signature;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority supports the National Government’s initiative to strengthen the legal framework for preventing, prohibiting, countering, and penalizing terrorism in the name of national security and the general welfare of the public with a whole-of-nation approach that unifies - not divides;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority submits that an effective counter-terrorism penal law must be evidence-based and intended to respond to the actual evil sought to be prevented or penalized with provisions that do not encroach on fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Constitution, and clearly distinguish conduct that is lawful from unlawful, to avert any misinterpretation and arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement in its implementation, giving individuals adequate notice of their legal obligations so that they can govern their behavior accordingly;

WHEREAS, the legislation not only contains provisions that invites questions of constitutionality, overbreadth and vagueness, but also lacks adequate measures against abuse and/or human rights violations. These provisions include: (a) sanctioning warrantless arrests outside of the limitations allowed by the Rules of Court; (b) allowing wire-tapping of private conversations/communications upon ex parte application before the Court of Appeals and without an opportunity for the “suspect” to present counter-veiling evidence at any stage of the proceedings; (c) detention of suspects for fourteen to twenty-four (14-24) days without a valid commitment order from the courts; and (d) unilateral designation of persons or groups as “terrorists” by the Anti-Terrorism Council, consisting of members appointed by the executive, and lack of remedies to question such designation before the courts, which provisions instill fear or compound resentment among our people;

WHEREAS, the stories and experiences of the Bangsamoro People, particularly on their decades-long struggle for peace, provide evidence that counter-terrorism strategies with no or limited regard for human rights cannot win the ideological battle against terrorism, nor can it suppress violent extremism;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, as the interim government of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, represents the concerns of the Moros, especially the conflict-affected population, who have fallen victim to both terrorist attacks and human rights violations;

WHEREAS, the Chief Minister, in a statement dated 22 June 2020, emphasizes the importance of taking a stand on issues that have direct impact on the Bangsamoro people and echoes the questionable provisions in the Anti-Terrorism Bill.

NOW, THEREFORE, be it

RESOLVED, as it is hereby resolved, to respectfully appeal to His Excellency President Rodrigo Roa Duterte to veto Senate Bill No. 1083 and House Bill No. 6875 or the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 to provide Congress the opportunity to review and address the issues of vagueness, overbreadth and other concerns.

RESOLVED, FURTHER, copies of this Resolution be furnished the Office of the President and the Office of the Chief Minister.

Adopted, July 2, 2020.
