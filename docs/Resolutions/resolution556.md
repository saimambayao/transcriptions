**RESOLUTION DIRECTING THE MINISTRY OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT TO APPRISE THE BANGSAMORO TRANSITION AUTHORITY PARLIAMENT ON THE STATUS OF TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION AND THE PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES BEING IMPLEMENTED BY THE MINISTRY RELATIVE THERETO**

**WHEREAS**, Section 5, Article II of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides that the maintenance of peace and order, the protection of life, liberty, and property, and the promotion of the general welfare are essential for the enjoyment by all the people of the blessings of democracy;

**WHEREAS**, Section 11 of the same Article provides that the State values the dignity of every human person and guarantees full respect for human rights;

**WHEREAS**, Section 3, Article V of the Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the “Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao”, provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants;

**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Article XVI of the same Organic Law states that the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament is the interim government in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region during the transition period;

**WHEREAS**, the Ministry of Social Services and Development (MSSD) is mandated to provide a balanced and responsive approach to social welfare whereby the rights, needs, and interests of all citizens within its jurisdiction, with special focus on the marginalized and vulnerable sectors, including women, children, senior citizens, persons with disabilities, indigenous cultural communities, internally displaced persons, and others similarly situated by analogy, are protected and addressed at all times, especially during the crises, whether natural or human-induced, that affect their well-being and their participation in community affairs;

**WHEREAS**, President Ferdinand “Bongbong” R. Marcos, Jr. has ordered the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking and the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission to strengthen and harmonize the efforts that address human trafficking concerns in the country. He emphasized that human trafficking activities could compromise the country’s economy and national security;

**WHEREAS**, the 2018 Global Slavery Index report shows a significant rise in the number of victims of human trafficking in the Philippines. Most notable was a recent incident involving thirteen (13) minors, including a two-month old baby, who were trafficked by their own relatives. Significantly, these minors were subsequently rescued by operatives of the National Bureau of Investigation. This incident is one among many that continue to occur to this day, making the Philippines ranked twelfth (12th) among countries with the highest incidence of modern-day slavery in the entire Asia-Pacific region;

**WHEREAS**, the same report provides that among the forty-four (44) million people trafficked globally, seventy-three percent (73%) are victims of forced sexual exploitation; sixty-eight percent (68%) were victims of forced labor; sixty-four percent (64%) are victims of labor exploitation; while forty-two percent (42%) are forced into marriage;

**WHEREAS**, according to the July 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report, the Philippines has maintained its Tier One (1) ranking for seven (7) consecutive years, the highest in the US State Department’s four (4)-tier placements;

**WHEREAS**, the same report covers government efforts undertaken from April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2022. During this period, the Philippine government identified a total of one thousand eight hundred two (1,802) trafficking victims, higher than the one thousand five hundred thirty-four (1,534) recorded in 2020;

**WHEREAS**, even though the Philippines maintained its highest-tier ranking, this does not necessarily mean that the country has resolved its human trafficking problems. It only means that the government fully meets the minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro government must intensify its efforts to monitor and investigate human trafficking cases within the region;

**WHEREAS**, despite government efforts to frequently remind overseas job applicants to follow the proper legal procedures, cases of human trafficking persist;

**WHEREAS**, updates on the status of trafficking in persons within the Bangsamoro Region can help inform policy and evaluate programs aimed at reducing human trafficking cases:

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, To direct the Ministry of Social Services and Development to apprise the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament on the status of trafficking in persons in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region and the programs and initiatives being implemented by the Ministry relative thereto.

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, To forward this Resolution to the MSSD, for information and appropriate action.

**ADOPTED**, Muharram 29, 1447/July 24, 2025.
