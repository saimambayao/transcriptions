**WHEREAS**, Republic Act No. 11332, otherwise known as the *“Mandatory Reporting of Notifiable Diseases and Health Events of Public Health Concern Act,”* aims to protect people from public health threats through the efficient and effective surveillance of diseases and other public health concerns.

**WHEREAS**, in providing for the above-mentioned status, the Bangsamoro Government needs reliable statistics to determine, assess, and plan for the future needs of the Bangsamoro people;

**WHEREAS**, the Ministry of Health (MOH) is the regional executive agency for health affairs in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). The Bangsamoro Government shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. It shall also uphold the people’s right to have access to essential goods, health, and other social services that promote their well-being;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Government shall assist and cooperate with the National Government in the provision of quarantine services for the prevention and control of epidemic and other communicable diseases, as provided in Section 22, Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), which states:

*“The Bangsamoro Government shall adopt a policy on health that provides for a comprehensive and integrated health service delivery for its constituents. It shall establish by law a general hospital system to serve the health requirements of its people and ensure that the individual basic right to life shall be attainable through the prompt intervention of excellent and affordable medical services”;*

**WHEREAS**, the updated figures from the MOH are evidenced-based data which are vital for measures that will be undertaken by the Bangsamoro Government;

**WHEREAS**, it is essential to know the status of the dengue cases, deaths, and the measures being undertaken in order for the Bangsamoro Parliament. Such status and data will be used as an official reference in crafting policies to prevent an increase of dengue cases in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, To direct, in aid of legislation, the Ministry of Health (MOH) to apprise the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) Parliament on the status and the extent of dengue cases and deaths, and the measures being undertaken in order to prevent an increase of dengue cases in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.
