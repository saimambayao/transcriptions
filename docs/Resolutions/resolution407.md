**RESOLUTION NO. 407**

**RESOLUTION CONDEMNING THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE AND COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF PALESTINE, AND CALLING FOR THE IMMEDIATE DECLARATION OF UNCONDITIONAL CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A HUMANITARIAN CORRIDOR FOR GAZA**

**WHEREAS**, on October 7, 2023, a group of fighters from Hamas’ military arm, the Al-Qassam brigades breached and attacked the fortified borders between Gaza and what is now known as Israel in the group’s deadliest attack in decades, resulting in the death of hundreds of Israeli soldiers and civilians;

**WHEREAS**, in response, the government of Israel, speaking through its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, vowed retaliation and formally declared war on Hamas;

**WHEREAS**, what followed were pronouncements from Israeli authorities of a “complete siege” of the Gaza strip and the cutting off of electricity, food, water, and fuel supplies therein;

**WHEREAS**, as of October 12, 2023, Israel says that it has dropped six thousand (6,000) bombs on Gaza weighing four thousand (4,000) metric tons in a span of six (6) days;

**WHEREAS**, as of October 13, 2023, ninety (90) educational facilities have been damaged, eleven (11) water sanitation facilities have been destroyed, nineteen (19) health centers are not fully operational, twenty (20) ambulances have been hit, eighteen (18) places of worship have been damaged including eleven (11) mosques which are completely destroyed, and sixty-four thousand two hundred eighty-three (64,283) residential units have been damaged with five thousand five hundred forty (5,540) of them completed destroyed;

**WHEREAS**, on the same day, Israel issued an order for the entire 1.1 million population of Gaza north of Wadi Gaza to relocate to the south within the next twenty-four (24) hours – including all United Nations (UN) staff and those sheltering in their schools, health centers, and clinics – if they are to be safe from the expected ground offensive;

**WHEREAS**, as of October 15, 2023, one thousand three hundred (1,300) have been killed in Israel, and two thousand three hundred (2,300) have been killed in Gaza;

**WHEREAS**, international humanitarian law under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court considers collective punishment and intentional attacks against civilian populations, attacks against medical units and transports, and attacks against places of worship as war crimes;

**WHEREAS**, while this series of attacks and counter-attacks should not be taken in isolation and should be understood in the broader context of the decades-long assertion of the Palestinian people of their right to self-determination, the crisis in our midst should not be viewed as religious, nor political, but primarily human and humanitarian and should be seen and urgently addressed as such:

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to condemn the acts of violence and collective punishment against the people of Palestine, and to call for the immediate declaration of unconditional cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hamas and the establishment of a humanitarian corridor for Gaza.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, To call for the end of hostilities and attacks against the civilian population of Palestine, especially in Gaza, and allow their safe return to their homeland, their humane and dignified treatment therein, and the complete rehabilitation thereof.

**RESOLVED, FURTHERMORE**, To call on Israel and Hamas to allow the UN to facilitate the establishment of a humanitarian corridor that will allow humanitarian actors to provide protection and immediate relief assistance to the people in Gaza;

**RESOLVED, FINALLY**, To furnish a copy of this Resolution to the Resident Coordinator of the UN in the Philippines, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the Embassies to the Philippines of Israel and of Palestine.
