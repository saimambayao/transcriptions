**RESOLUTION URGING THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT, THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH - BARMM, IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNITS (LGU) TO PURCHASE MUCH NEEDED COLD STORAGE FACILITIES, INCLUDING ULTRA LOW TEMPERATURE (ULT) FREEZERS, IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO AVAIL OF ANY AND ALL BRANDS OF COVID-19 VACCINES AND FOR PROPER STORAGE THEREOF**

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Government has the duty and obligation to ensure the health and safety of the Bangsamoro people residing in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) and to facilitate, promote and accelerate the socioeconomic development of the Autonomous Region;

WHEREAS, the BARMM, along with the rest of the Philippines, has been suffering the serious effects of the pandemic, not only as to the health and safety of the Bangsamoro people, but also as to the socioeconomic development in the BARMM;

WHEREAS, under Section 8 on Social Justice of Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), some of the essential things that the Bangsamoro Government is mandated to do is to provide, maintain, and ensure “the delivery of basic and responsive health programs”, as well as to “maintain appropriate disaster-preparedness units for immediate and effective relief services to victims of natural and man-made calamities”, such as the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic;

WHEREAS, Sec. 3 of Article V and Section 22 of Article IX of the BOL, basically provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall protect and promote the health and safety of the Bangsamoro people;

WHEREAS, Section 2, Chapter 1, Title V of Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 13, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Administrative Code (BAC) provides the mandate of the Ministry of Health (MOH) - BARMM, which is “primarily responsible for the formulation, planning, implementation and coordination of policies and programs for health” and is tasked to “promote, protect, preserve and restore the health of the people through the provision and delivery of health services through regulation and encouragement of providers of health goods and services”;

WHEREAS, to ensure that there is proper and effective implementation of the law and that the Bangsamoro people are receiving the services envisioned and manifested in our legislation, the MOH - BARMM is urged to provide further updates on the status of the on-going vaccinations for COVID-19 in the BARMM;

WHEREAS, the MOH - BARMM has been allocated P500 Million for the purchase of vaccines aside from the P380 Million which was set aside for its COVID-19 Response Plan;

WHEREAS, the MOH - BARMM, on the other hand, is indefinitely prohibited from purchasing any COVID-19 vaccines since the National Government has been allocating vaccines to the Region based on the number of people registered for vaccination;

WHEREAS, information from the MOH - BARMM has shown that we are to be allocated even more vaccines from the National Government according to the number of Bangsamoro registered to be vaccinated, but there are not enough cold storage facilities across the BARMM to store COVID-19 vaccines;

WHEREAS, due to the lack of proper cold storage facilities, COVID-19 vaccines are alarmingly being stored in the same storage facilities as regular vaccines, such as those for infant immunization, likewise compromising the proper storage of the latter as there are often too many vaccines of any kind being stored in one space;

WHEREAS, there is a clear need to increase the number of cold storage facilities, including Ultra Low Freezers (ULF) or Ultra Low Temperature (ULT) Freezers, across the BARMM in order for the Region to be able to receive any kind of the available and numerous vaccines that will be allocated to BARMM;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Government through the MOH - BARMM should coordinate with various agencies, offices, and ministries, such as the Ministry of the Interior and Local Government (MILG) , as well as Local Government Units (LGU) within the BARMM to ensure proper purchase or acquisition of the cold storage facilities, as needed.

NOW, THEREFORE, be it

RESOLVED, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to urge the Bangsamoro Government, through the Ministry of Health - BARMM, in close coordination with Local Government Units (LGU) to purchase much needed cold storage facilities, including Ultra Low Temperature (ULT) freezers, in order to be able to avail of any and all brands of covid-19 vaccines and for proper storage thereof, for the efficient roll-out of the vaccines to the Bangsamoro people for the protection and promotion of their health and safety.

RESOLVED, FINALLY, to forward the foregoing Resolution to the MOH - BARMM for further information and appropriate consideration.

ADOPTED, June 24, 2021.
