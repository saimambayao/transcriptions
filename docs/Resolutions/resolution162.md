**RESOLUTION NO. 162**

**RESOLUTION REQUESTING THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO IMMEDIATELY CONVENE A BICAMERAL CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AND RECONCILE SENATE BILL NO. 2214 AND HOUSE BILL NO. 10121 TO EXPEDITE THE ENACTMENT OF A LAW RESETTING THE FIRST REGIONAL ELECTIONS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO TO 2025**

WHEREAS, Section 13, Article XVI of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law stipulates that:

“*The first regular election for the Bangsamoro Government under this Organic Law shall be held and synchronized with the 2022 national elections. The Commission on elections, through the Bangsamoro Electoral Office, shall promulgate rules and regulations for the conduct of elections, enforce and administer them pursuant to national laws, this Organic Law and the Bangsamoro Electoral Code.*”

WHEREAS, upon the ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law, the interim Regional Government was given three years to (1) enact the priority codes that would establish institutions for self-governance; (2) organize a new bureaucracy for the region; and (3) ensure the continuous delivery of services;

WHEREAS, in January 2020, both National and Regional Governments had to redirect their attention to emerging global pandemic caused by the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, and this resulted to the delay in the implementation of both the political track and normalization aspect of the peace process;

WHEREAS, with little time left before the 2022 National Elections, the BTA Parliament has yet to enact the Bangsamoro Electoral Code, and organize the Parliamentary Districts for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao;

WHEREAS, to ensure stability and facilitate the transition to a new regional government, various sectors pushed for the resetting of the first regular elections of the region from 2022 to 2025, and advocated for the extension of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority;

WHEREAS, responding to the clamor, both the Senate and House of Representatives filed their respective iteration of a bill amending Section 13, Article XVI of the Bangsamoro Organic Law and resetting the first regular elections for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Mindanao to 2025;

WHEREAS, on September 6, 2021, Senate approved on third and final reading Senate Bill No. 2214, the Senate’s version of the bill resetting the first regional elections in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao in 2025; with 15 senators voting in favor, 3 senators against it, and 1 senator who abstained from voting;

WHEREAS, on September 15, 2021, the House of Representatives, approved on third and final reading House Bill No. 10121, its version of the proposed measure, with a slight deviation from the Senate’s version, specifically on the appointment of new members of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority;

WHEREAS, to reconcile the different versions of the proposed measure, a Bicameral Conference Committee must be convened at the soonest possible time to enact a law resetting the first regional elections in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to 2025:

NOW, THEREFORE, be it

RESOLVED, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to request the Senate and the House of Representatives to immediately convene a Bicameral Conference Committee and reconcile Senate Bill No. 2214 and House Bill No. 10121 to expedite the enactment of a law resetting the first regional elections in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to 2025.
