**FIRST REGULAR SESSION**

**RESOLUTION NO. 44**

**RESOLUTION CALLING FOR THE BANGSAMORO TRANSITION AUTHORITY’S SESSIONS TO FINISH OR GO INTO RECESS A REASONABLE TIME BEFORE JUMMAH PRAYERS ON FRIDAYS**

**WHEREAS,** it has been observed that during Friday sessions of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, the sessions do not end or go into recess with enough time for Members of the Parliament to go in the Mosque to perform Jummah Prayers;

**WHEREAS,** the Members of the Parliament cannot perform their Jummah prayers without leaving the session hall while session is still going on since they do not want to disrupt the discussions on the floor and the order of business;

**WHEREAS,** majority of the Members of the Parliament are Muslims and are obliged to follow the injunction of the Almighty Allah in the Ayah of the Qur’an, Surah 62 (Al-Jumua 9 – 10):

**يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِذَا نُودِيَ لِلصَّلَاةِ مِن يَوْمِ الْجُمُعَةِ فَاسْعَوْا إِلَىٰ ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ وَذَرُوا الْبَيْعَ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ - 62:9**

**فَإِذَا قُضِيَتِ الصَّلَاةُ فَانتَشِرُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ وَابْتَغُوا مِن فَضْلِ اللَّهِ وَاذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ كَثِيرًا لَّعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ - 62:10**

(O you who believe! When the call is proclaimed to prayer on Friday (the Day of Assembly, yawm al-jumu’ah, hasten earnestly to the Remembrance of Allah and leave off business (and traffic): That is best for you if you but knew! And when the Prayer is finished, then you may disperse through the land, and seek of the Bounty of Allah: and celebrate the Praises of Allah often (and without stint): that you may prosper.

**NOW THEREFORE,** be it

**RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved, that the Bangsamoro Transition Authority shall either end its sessions or go into recess within a reasonable time for its member to be able to go and perform their Jummah Prayers on Fridays.

**Adopted,** October 18, 2019.
