**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Government enacted Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 17, or the Bangsamoro Civil Service Code of 2021, to govern the conduct of civil servants, prescribe qualifications for non-elective positions, adopt an independent and credible merit and fitness system, and protect civil service eligibles in various government positions in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, as well as to provide rules on disciplinary authority over the Bangsamoro Government’s officials and employees;

**WHEREAS**, Section 33, Chapter 5, Book V of Executive Order No. 292, provides:

*“There shall be established a performance evaluation system, which shall be administered in accordance with rules, regulations and standards promulgated by the Civil Service Commission for all officers and employees in the career service. Such performance evaluation system shall be administered in such manner as to continually foster the improvement of individual employee efficiency and organizational effectiveness.”*

**WHEREAS**, the Congress of the Philippines in 2008 issued Joint Resolution No. 4 providing the governing principles of the modified compensation and position classification system and base pay schedule of the government, part of which is the establishment of a performance-based incentive scheme that integrates personnel and organizational performance to reward exemplary civil servants and well-performing institutions;

**WHEREAS**, the Strategic Performance Management System was officially established and implemented in 2012 by the Civil Service Commission as its government-wide performance evaluation and appraisal system through Memorandum Circular No. 6, Series of 2012;

**WHEREAS**, the Strategic Performance Management System is being used in appraising and linking individual performance to organizational vision, mission and goals as an integral part of the Performance-Based Incentive System currently in place that rewards employees based on their contribution to the accomplishment of their organizational targets and commitments;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Civil Service Code states that the Bangsamoro Government may adopt the provision of Performance-Based Bonus in the BARMM, and the Ministry of Finance, and Budget and Management to formulate its own guidelines subject to the approval of the Chief Minister;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Civil Service Code mandates the use of the Strategic Performance recognition of an official or employee’s meritorious performance as basis of increase in salary in case of change or human resource movement;

**WHEREAS**, to date, only four (4) agencies of the Bangsamoro Government have approved Strategic Performance Management System while all the rest are either still establishing or awaiting the approval of the Civil Service Commission;

**WHEREAS**, the Civil Service Commission has been liberal in acting upon the appointments issued by the agencies of the Bangsamoro Government despite the lack of their respective performance management system;

**WHEREAS**, the adoption and implementation of the Strategic Performance Management System is crucial in the full implementation of the Bangsamoro Civil Service Code and the policy of the Bangsamoro Government to provide within the public service a progressive system of human resource administration and adopt measures to promote morale and the highest degree of responsibility, morality, integrity, loyalty, efficiency, and professionalism in the civil service:

**RESOLVED, FURTHERMORE**, to urge the Office of the Chief Minister to set a deadline for the establishment and implementation of the Strategic Performance Management System in all agencies of the Bangsamoro Government.
