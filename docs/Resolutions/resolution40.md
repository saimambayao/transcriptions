**FIRST REGULAR SESSION**

**RESOLUTION NO. 40**

**RESOLUTION CALLING FOR THE URGENT ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF AN OFFICIAL WEBSITE FOR THE BANGSAMORO TRANSITION AUTHORITY TO BE MAINTAINED BY ITS OWN INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY UNIT AS AN INSTRUMENT TO INFORM THE PUBLIC OF THE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PARLIAMENT AND TO PROVIDE AN OFFICIAL ONLINE SOURCE OF INFORMATION, CONSISTENT WITH THE FULL DISCLOSURE POLICY OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT, TRANSPARENCY, AND GOOD GOVERNANCE**

**WHEREAS,** *Sections 27 and 28 Article II of the Philippine Constitution categorically pronounced as State Policies the following provisions:*

*SECTION 27. The State shall maintain honesty and integrity in the public service and take positive and effective measures against graft and corruption.*

*SECTION 28. Subject to reasonable conditions prescribed by law, the State adopts and implements a policy of full public disclosure of all its transactions involving public interest.*

**WHEREAS,** as of 18 September 2019, there are fifteen (15) proposed Bills, 101 Resolutions, six (6) Committee Reports, and fifteen (15) Journals that have been submitted, recorded, and acted upon by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) from the time of its establishment;

**WHEREAS,** there are also calendar of activities, procurement activities, and various legislative measures adopted by the BTA which, albeit available, are not readily and easily accessible by the public in general;

**WHEREAS,** Section 3, Article XVI of Republic Act No. 11054 otherwise known as the *Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao* (OLBARMM) declares that during the transition period, executive authority shall be exercised by the Interim Chief Minister while legislative authority shall be exercised by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority;

**WHEREAS,** while there is an official website for the BARMM, the same is maintained exclusively by the Information and Communication Technology Office under the Office of the Chief Minister;

**WHEREAS,** the aforementioned official website of the BARMM provides the public with pertinent information relating mainly to the executive issuances and activities of the various ministries and offices operating under the Office of the Chief Minister thereby understandably leaving out the equally important official legislative processes and measures of the BTA;

**WHEREAS,** the BTA has its own legislative issuances and public transactions that should be indispensably disclosed to the public in general if only to promote accountability and good governance;

**WHEREAS,** even the BTA Members rely only on the documents and data provided by the Office of the Secretary General, on a request basis, to be used for public consultations and information dissemination in their respective constituencies;

**WHEREAS,** in the absence of such supposed public documents and data that could only be accessed upon request with the Office of the Secretary General, the BTA Members and the public have nowhere else to look into for genuine, unadulterated public information;

**WHEREAS,** the generation and sharing of fake news these days pose a difficult challenge as well as to the efficient delivery of public service thus compelling for the formation of a new tool that would provide the public with such genuine, unadulterated public information;

**WHEREAS,** the establishment of an official website for the Bangsamoro Transition Authority would ease, if not totally eliminate, the doubt on the authenticity of the legislative documents, measures, and acts;

**WHEREAS,** the establishment of an official website for the Bangsamoro Transition Authority would likewise update the public with the recent developments in the legislative branch of the BARMM as a working component of the government that they have entrusted their hopes with;

**NOW, THEREFORE,** be it

**RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved, to call for the urgent establishment and maintenance of an official website for the Bangsamoro Transition Authority to be maintained by its own Information and Communication Technology Unit as an instrument to inform the public of the recent developments in the Parliament and to provide an official online source of information, consistent with the full disclosure policy of the National Government, transparency, and good governance.

**Adopted,** September 25, 2019.
