SECOND REGULAR SESSION

**RESOLUTION NO. 375**

RESOLUTION URGING THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON MUSLIM FILIPINOS (NCMF) AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH – BUREAU OF QUARANTINE (BOQ) TO ADOPT AND INSTITUTE MECHANISMS THAT WILL MINIMIZE THE BURDEN ON PILGRIMS FROM THE ISLAND PROVINCES IN COMPLYING WITH THE HAJJ VACCINATION REQUIREMENT

WHEREAS, Section 22, Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law, states that the Bangsamoro Government shall adopt a policy on health that provides for a comprehensive and integrated health service delivery for its constituents;

WHEREAS, Muslim Pilgrims from the Philippines have to be inoculated with the flu and meningococcal vaccine as required by the Saudi Arabian embassy before the pilgrim’s visa for Hajj would be approved;

WHEREAS, the Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) of the Department of Health (DOH) has the mandate of inoculating Filipino pilgrims for the yearly Hajj and of issuing vaccine passports which serve as proof of the vaccination;

WHEREAS, it is the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF) Central Office that handles the procurement of vaccines and delivers the vaccines to the different BOQ stations across the country for the administration of the vaccines;

WHEREAS, aside from the actual payment for the purchase of the vaccines, pilgrims from the Island Provinces of the Bangsamoro, namely Basilan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi, would also need to pay for fare and lodging to travel to Zamboanga City since the venue for vaccinations in Western Mindanao is conducted only in the Zamboanga City Station of the BOQ;

WHEREAS, the BOQ specified only a specific day for such vaccination, making it even more difficult for pilgrims and adding to the cost burden to the pilgrims;

WHEREAS, the strict schedule for the inoculation of pilgrims adds further inconvenience to the pilgrims as they would need to be at the BOQ station on a specified day or miss the opportunity to be vaccinated, therefore costing them their opportunity to participate in the year’s Hajj;

WHEREAS, these numerous steps in a program as simple as the Hajj-required vaccination opens its implementation to the possibility of delays and red tape affecting the pilgrims who have already paid for their vaccination in order to be allowed pilgrimage to Mecca;

WHEREAS, aside from having to travel to Zamboanga City just to be vaccinated for the Hajj, the Bangsamoro pilgrims are also affected by bureaucratic problems between the NCMF and BOQ involving the procurement of vaccines;

WHEREAS, in an incident that happened last May 09, 2023, the scheduled first day of vaccinations, pilgrims who were mostly residents of Basilan and Tawi-Tawi, lined up as early as 7:30 in the morning but were only administered with their purchased vaccines at 3 pm that day;

WHEREAS, according to BOQ staff members, the NCMF supplier delivered the meningococcal vaccines using unsealed boxes without ice packs, compromising their integrity, and the BOQ decided to wait for a new batch of vaccines to be delivered;

WHEREAS, while waiting for the implementing offices to sort out the problem with the delivery of vaccines, the pilgrims had to wait in line outside the BOQ Station under the scorching heat of the sun;

WHEREAS, this apparent lack of mechanisms to ensure the efficient, effective and timely conduct of the Hajj vaccinations causes inconvenience and health hazards to Bangsamoro constituents needing to avail of the vaccination;

WHEREAS, the preparations leading to this annual vaccination program need to improve through the employment of better mechanisms for the timely procurement and delivery of vaccines safe for human administration for the conduct of vaccinations right in the Island provinces for the benefit and convenience of the Bangsamoro Pilgrims;

WHEREAS, proper coordination among the NCMF, DOH and the Local Government Units (LGUs) of the island provinces shall be timely made every year to ensure the convenience, comfort and health of the prospective pilgrims;

WHEREAS, vaccination may be conducted and administered by trained health personnel of the Ministry of Health (MOH) in the Rural Health Units (RHUs) at least one week before their expected date of departure, under the supervision of the Integrated Provincial Health Office (IPHO) of the respective province:

NOW, THEREFORE, be it

RESOLVED, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, To urge the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF) and the Department of Health – Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) to adopt and institute mechanisms that will minimize the burden on pilgrims from the Island Provinces in complying with the Hajj vaccination requirement.

RESOLVED, FURTHER, That a copy of this Resolution be furnished to the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF) and the Department of Health – Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ), for information.

ADOPTED, Muharram 07, 1445/July 25, 2023.
