**RESOLUTION NO. 232**

**RESOLUTION CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY TO ADOPT A WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT APPROACH IN CRAFTING COMPREHENSIVE POLICIES, PLANS, PROGRAMS, AND PROJECTS FOR THE BANGSAMORO DOMESTIC WORKERS, ESPECIALLY WOMEN**

**WHEREAS,** Philippines is one of the world’s top countries to deploy migrant domestic workers, averaging 86,000 Filipinos every year between 1992 and 2015. In the recent official data released by Philippine Statistics Authority, out of the 2.3 million Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) who worked abroad during the period April to September 2018, 437,000 OFWs hail from the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). Elementary occupations (37.1%) and service and sales workers (18.8%), to which domestic workers belong, was the biggest group of OFWs. Most importantly, majority are female OFWs comprising 55.8% of the total number of OFWs;

**WHEREAS,** the Bangsamoro Government has the power to “develop programs and laws for women” (*Sec. 1 [r], Art. V, RA 11054*) and mandated to “uphold and protect the fundamental rights of women, including the right to engage in lawful employment, and to be protected from exploitation, abuse, or discrimination, as embodied in the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women” (*Sec. 12, Art 9, RA 11054*);

**WHEREAS,** it is also further stated that the Bangsamoro Government shall provide for Comprehensive Framework for Sustainable Development which includes, among others, “the reduction of the vulnerability of women” (*Sec. 3, Art XIII, RA 11054*);

**WHEREAS,** most women OFWs employed for domestic work have the least social protection from labor laws in many countries. Accordingly, the hidden nature of domestic work within the private sphere of the employers’ household and the informal employment arrangements, make domestic workers particularly vulnerable to difficult or abusive work situations. In fact, reports show that women OFWs suffer from exploitation, forced labor, trafficking, discrimination, and other forms of violence;

**WHEREAS,** poverty, lack of economic opportunities and unfortunate social conditions, among others, force women to take the risks associated with illegal recruitment and/or migration, and accept abusive working conditions;

**WHEREAS,** in order to alleviate the pressures on domestic helpers to accept situations of abuse and exploitation, there is a need to broaden the understanding of the underlying issues which play critical roles in the decision-making of women OFWs:

**NOW, THEREFORE,** be it

**RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to call on the Government of the Day to adopt a whole of government approach in crafting comprehensive policies, plans, programs, and projects for the Bangsamoro domestic workers, especially women.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER,** to request the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) and the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) to furnish the BARMM Ministry of Labor and Employment (MOLE) reports and relevant data on the status and condition of Bangsamoro domestic workers and other related documents for comprehensive legislative research for the benefit of the aforementioned group.

**RESOLVED, FINALLY,** to forward the foregoing Resolution to the concerned ministries and offices, for information and appropriate action.

**ADOPTED,** Sha’baan 13, 1443/March 17, 2022.
