**RESOLUTION NO. 258**

**RESOLUTION CONGRATULATING AND COMMENDING THE SEVEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FORTY-FIVE (7,145) MORO ISLAMIC LIBERATION FRONT AND MORO NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT MEMBERS WHO PASSED THE NATIONAL POLICE COMMISSION SPECIAL QUALIFYING ELIGIBILITY EXAM**

**WHEREAS**, Paragraph 3, Section 2, Article XI of Republic Act No. 11054 or Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao provides that to facilitate entry into the Philippine National Police (PNP) of Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) members from the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, the age, height, and educational attainment requirements may be waived by the National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM), subject to existing rules and regulations: *Provided, That such shall be availed of within a period of five (5) years from the ratification of this Organic Law: Provided, further, That the requirement of educational attainment shall be complied within fifteen (15) years from their entry: Provided, finally, That their ranks and grades shall be subject to existing laws, rules, and regulations governing the PNP;*

**WHEREAS**, in compliance with the said provision of the law, the NAPOLCOM issued Resolution No. 2022-0081, entitled, "*Prescribing NAPOLCOM Special Qualifying Eligibility (NSQE) as Appropriate Eligibility for Temporary Appointment to the Rank of Patrolman/Patrolwoman in the Philippine National Police (PNP) for members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF)*" which was approved on February 8, 2022;

**WHEREAS**, the NAPOLCOM conducted the NAPOLCOM Special Qualifying Eligibility Examination (NSQEE) in Cotabato City, Maguindanao, and Lamitan City, Basilan on May 29, 2022, wherein eleven thousand thirty-three (11,033) members of the MILF and MNLF took the examination;

**WHEREAS**, the exam result was released on Monday, July 12, 2022;

**WHEREAS**, a total of seven thousand one hundred forty-five (7,145) examinees or 64.77% of eleven thousand thirty-three (11,033) members of the MILF and MNLF have passed the NSQEE;

**WHEREAS**, passing the NSQEE does not automatically guarantee recruitment to the PNP. The exam passers are expected to undergo training and the PNP recruitment process, such as Body Mass Index (BMI), Physical Agility Test (PAT), neurological exam, medical and dental exams, drug test, complete background check, as well as a final board interview. However, when the MILF and MNLF members who are NSQEE exam passers do become full-fledged members of the PNP one day, they will not only return to mainstream society as peaceful and productive civilians, but also be part of the country's law enforcement officers and help ensure peace and security, not only in their communities but also in the entire country as well;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority extends its felicitations and warmest greetings to the passers of the NSQEE;

**NOW, THEREFORE**, be it

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the BTA Parliament, To congratulate and commend the seven thousand one hundred forty-five (7,145) Moro Islamic Liberation Front and Moro National Liberation Front members who passed the National Police Commission special qualifying eligibility exam.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, That a copy of this foregoing Resolution be furnished to the MILF and MNLF, for information.

**ADOPTED**, Dhu Al-Hijjah 20, 1443/July 19, 2022.
