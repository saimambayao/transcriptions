**RESOLUTION NO. 112**

**RESOLUTION EXPRESSING THE DEEPEST CONDOLENCES AND PROFOUND SYMPATHY OF THE BANGSAMORO PARLIAMENT OF THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO TO THE BEREAVED FAMILY ON THE PASSING AWAY OF FORMER LANAO DEL SUR PROVINCIAL GOVERNOR PRINCESS TARHATA ALANGADI ALONTO LUCMAN**

**WHEREAS**, on February 26, 2021 in Marawi City, at the age of 95 years old, former Governor Princess Tarhata Alangadi Alonto Lucman peacefully returned to her creator after suffering from cardiac arrest;

**WHEREAS**, Princess Tarhata Alangadi Alonto Lucman was the fourth child last surviving daughter of Bai Bariga Alangadi, a direct descendant of Sultan Muhammad Dipatuan Kudarat, and the Sultan of Ramain, Senator Alauya Alonto, who served as a delegate of Lanao in the Philippine Constitutional Convention of 1934 which eventually caused his election as the first Maranao Senator under the Philippine Commonwealth in 1935;

**WHEREAS**, Princess Tarhata is the sister of Senator Domocao Alangadi Alonto, Hajja Naima Alangadi Alonto, Ambassador Abdul Ghaffur Alangadi Alonto, Datu Masiding Alangadi Alonto, Datu Madrigal Alangadi Alonto and Hajja Zubaidah Alonto, and she is the wife of the Sultan of Bayang, Congressman Haroun Al-Rashid Lucman, a World War II guerrilla hero known as one of the pioneering Moro statesmen that advocated for Moro independence;

**WHEREAS**, Princess Tarhata was elected as the first lady provincial governor of Lanao del Sur in 1971 where during her stint she prioritized the strengthening of ties between the Muslims and Christians in her area and spearheaded the peaceful settlements of ridos (clan feuds) while promoting esteemed collaborations among stakeholders in pushing for reforms in government;

**WHEREAS**, during the Martial Law, she was one of the Moro leaders who bravely defied the dictatorship of President Ferdinand Marcos, and was unceremoniously removed from her office, and exiled to Saudi Arabia with her family in 1975;

**WHEREAS**, after the EDSA People Power Revolution in 1986, she returned to the Philippines to continue her advocacies for peace, part of which was the safe release of Fr. Michael de Gigord, Brian Lawrence as well as ten Filipino nuns abducted in Marawi City during said year;

**WHEREAS**, Princess Tarhata Alangadi Alonto Lucman is an embodiment of Bangsamoro women empowerment breaking cultural barriers in promoting women participation in governance, making her an icon of good governance and inspiring generations of Bangsamoro leaders;

**WHEREAS**, a true civil servant to the mandate of the law, she was an advocate of transparency and honest governance, supporter of peace, order and safety for her constituents;

**WHEREAS**, this expression of condolence and sympathy may not be enough to demonstrate her achievements in good governance and public service but this is, however, a genuine and indisputable tribute to a public figure whose memory and legacy cannot be expressed by mere words alone, hence, this Bangsamoro Parliament shares the grief and loss of the bereaved family;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved, to express the deepest condolences and profound sympathy of the Bangsamoro Parliament of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to the bereaved family of former Lanao del Sur Provincial Governor Princess Tarhata Alangadi Alonto Lucman on her untimely demise.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, to forward this Resolution to the bereaved family members of Princess Tarhata, for information.

**ADOPTED**, March 17, 2021.
