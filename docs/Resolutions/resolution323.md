**RESOLUTION NO. 323**

**RESOLUTION REQUESTING THE OFFICE OF THE HONORABLE CHIEF MINISTER TO GRANT INFLATION RELIEF ASSISTANCE NOT EXCEEDING FIFTEEN THOUSAND PESOS (P15,000.00) TO ALL OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS GOVERNMENT OF WHATEVER STATUS INCLUDING PERSONS ENGAGED UNDER CONTRACTS OF SERVICE AND JOB ORDERS, EXCLUDING THE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT, MINISTERS, DEPUTY MINISTERS, DIRECTOR-GENERALS AND HEADS OF OFFICES, TO BE RELEASED DURING THE MONTH OF RAMADHAN 1444, SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS**

**WHEREAS**, the inhabitants of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region have been plagued by sustained rise in prices since August last year where the inflation rate rose from 1.9% in January 2022 to 7.8% in January 2023, with 7.5% in February 2023 from 1.6% in February 2022;

**WHEREAS**, the Regional Statistical Office of the Philippine Statistical Authority for Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) reported a sustained surge in the rate of inflation in the Bangsamoro since April 2022 where the rate rose to 2.1% then 2.4% in May, 3.1% in June, 3.6% in July, 4.9% in August, then 6% in September, 6.5% in October, 6% in November and 6.3% in December before it jumped to 7.8% in January 2023;

**WHEREAS**, the trend in the rise in prices will be further aggravated by the usual surge in the cost of basic commodities during the month of Ramadhan, which this year will commence no later than March 24, 2023;

**WHEREAS**, the surge in prices will not only affect the Muslims who will be fasting during the month of Ramadhan but all inhabitants of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS**, inflation will not only be felt by government employees but also by private sector entrepreneurs who will suffer lower sales due to the reduced buying capability of the public;

**WHEREAS**, the impact of the rise in the cost of commodities during the Christmas season is minimized by the 14$^{th}$ Month pay to the government and private sector employees;

**WHEREAS**, Ramadhan is an equally significant occasion celebrated globally similar to that of Christmas day where all government and private employees are given the 13$^{th}$ month pay equivalent to one (1) month basic salary pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 851 as modified in Memorandum Order No. 28, Series of 1986;

**WHEREAS**, providing additional allowance during the month of Ramadhan to all personnel and employees of the BARMM is one way of motivating them to work harder and be more productive even in the difficult time of the month-long fasting and dusk-to-dawn prayers;

**WHEREAS**, there is a need for financial assistance to alleviate the burden of our regional government employees during this upward trend in regional inflation as well as the aggravating rise in prices during the month of Ramadhan;

**WHEREAS**, the grant of said assistance to the regional government employees will also redound to the benefit of business entrepreneurs as it will contend the reduction in the purchasing capabilities of most of the consumers;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Government had previously granted similar relief allowance in the past years:

**NOW, THEREFORE**, be it

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, To request the Office of the Honorable Chief Minister to grant inflation relief assistance not exceeding Fifteen Thousand Pesos (P15,000.00) to all officials and employees of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Government of whatever status including persons engaged under contracts of service and job orders, excluding the Members of Parliament, Ministers, Deputy Ministers, Director-Generals and heads of offices, to be released during the month of Ramadhan 1444, subject to the availability of funds.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, To forward this Resolution to the Honorable Chief Minister Ahod Balawag Ebrahim, for his information and appropriate action.

**ADOPTED**, *Sha’ban* 29, 1444/March 21, 2023.
