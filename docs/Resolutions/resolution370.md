**WHEREAS**, based on recent Philippine Statistics Authority’s (PSA) Fisheries Situation Report from April to June 2022, the total volume of fisheries production in the country reached 1,213.31 metric tons (MT), Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) ranked first among the country’s top five (5) fish- producing regions during the second quarter of 2022, with total fisheries production of 346.42 MT or 28.6%, making it the biggest contributor for fisheries production in the Philippines;

**WHEREAS**, most of the fisheries productions in BARMM, which are mainly aquaculture, were produced in the island provinces of Tawi-Tawi, Sulu, and Basilan situated in the Sulu Sea, within the territorial jurisdiction of the Regional Government;

**WHEREAS**, based on the same Fisheries Situation Report, Zamboanga Peninsula (Region IX) ranked second with 153.38 MT (12.6%) and SOCCSKSARGEN (Region XII) ranked fifth with 89.41 MT (7.4%), these regions are contiguous to the Regional Government and therefore their production may have come from the Sulu Sea;

**WHEREAS**, pursuant to the legislative mandate under aforesaid Sec. 18, Article XIII of the Organic Act, Joint Body for the Zones of Joint Cooperation, which is the government agency responsible for providing public with mapmaking services and acting as its central mapping agency, has made the preliminary delineation of the municipal and regional waters and the Zones of Joint Cooperation but the same has not been finalized owing to some issues and concerns such as boundary disputes between the BARMM and non-BARMM local government units, among others;

**WHEREAS**, there is a necessity to finalize the coordinates and therefore delineate and demarcate the municipal and regional waters and Zones of Joint Cooperation in the Sulu Sea and Moro Gulf, if only to provide legal bases for the regional government and/or its local government units within these bodies of water to exercise their revenue making powers, among others;
