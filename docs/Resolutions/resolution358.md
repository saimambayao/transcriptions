**RESOLUTION NO. 358**

RESOLUTION CONDEMNING, IN THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE TERMS, THE ACT OF SOME VENDORS OF THE GENERAL SANTOS CITY PUBLIC MARKET OF COATING TUNA WITH PIG’S BLOOD TO DECEPTIVELY MAKE IT LOOK FRESH

WHEREAS, Section 11, Article II of the 1987 Constitution provides that the State values the dignity of every human person and guarantees full respect for human rights;

WHEREAS, Section 5, Article III of the 1987 Constitution states that the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever be allowed;

WHEREAS, Article 2, Title I of Republic Act No. 7394 or the Consumer Act of the Philippines declares that it is the policy of the State to protect the interest of the consumer, promote general welfare, and establish standards of conduct for business and industry. Towards this end, the State shall implement measures to achieve the following objectives: a) protection against hazards to health and safety; b) protection against deceptive, unfair and unconscionable sales acts and practices; c) provision of information and education to facilitate sound choice and proper exercise of rights by the consumer; d) provision of adequate rights and means of redress; and e) involvement of consumer representatives in the formulation of social and economic policies;

WHEREAS, Section 3, Article V of Republic Act No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants;

WHEREAS, General Santos City is known as the Philippines’ Tuna Capital, wherein tons of fresh tuna are delivered by several fishermen;

WHEREAS, on May 15, 2023, the General Santos City Market Vendor’s Association (GSCMVA) uncovered a deceitful practice in which several market vendors were found coating tuna fish slices with pig’s blood to make the goods appear fresh;

WHEREAS, the market inspection team caught several vendors in the act of selling said fish slices with a thin coating of pig’s blood at General Santos City’s Public Market. Plastic packs of pig’s blood were seized from the vendors involved;

WHEREAS, the Local Government Unit (LGU) of General Santos City ordered the four vending stalls in the market that were found smearing pig’s blood on the fish to stop operating and to close their stalls, pending the outcome of the disciplinary proceedings against them;

WHEREAS, Muslims are prohibited by their religion from consuming pork or any food containing any derivates of pork since it is haram or forbidden. The consumption of those which are halal, or food or products that are permissible according to Islamic law, is of utmost importance to Muslims;

WHEREAS, the practice of mixing pig’s blood with tuna is not only a deceptive practice, but also contaminates the fish meat, rendering such unfit for consumption by Muslims;

WHEREAS, in a predominantly Christian country like the Philippines, products containing pork are abundant in the market. This is the main reason why Muslims in the Philippines are very particular with the food they consume;

WHEREAS, the importance of respecting one’s religion, which includes the consumption of halal products for Muslims, must be recognized. The unscrupulous business practice of using pig’s blood on the tuna to make it look fresh is a blatant offense and a form of disrespect to the Muslim community;

WHEREAS, Muslims were affected by this practice from inside and outside of General Santos City, including those from the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao:

NOW, THEREFORE, be it

RESOLVED, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, To condemn in the strongest possible terms, the act of some vendors of the General Santos City Public Market of coating tuna with pig’s blood to deceptively make it look fresh.

RESOLVED, FURTHER, That this Resolution be forwarded to the local government of General Santos City, for information and appropriate action.

ADOPTED, Dhul Hijjah 08, 1444/June 26, 2023.
