**THIRD REGULAR SESSION**

**RESOLUTION NO. 128**

**RESOLUTION ENCOURAGING ALL NEWLY APPOINTED EMPLOYEES TO TAKE THEIR RESPECTIVE OATH OF MORAL GOVERNANCE BEFORE THE OFFICE OF THE WALI**

**WHEREAS,** Moral Governance is the cornerstone of the Bangsamoro Government and remains the highest commitment by the Interim Chief Minister since the establishment of Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), reiterating governing in accordance with moral virtues of mankind;

**WHEREAS,** Section 1 of Article VIII of the Bangsamoro Organic Law states that there shall be a *Wali* who shall serve as the ceremonial head of the Bangsamoro Government. In the same vein, the *Wali* is empowered to administer the Oath of Office for the Bangsamoro government, including the Chief Minister and all the members of the Parliament upon their election;

**WHEREAS,** the Oath of Moral Governance is enshrined in the newly-approved Bangsamoro Administrative Code (Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 13), mandating all employees, among others, to take the Oath of Moral Governance:

**Sec. 24. Oaths of Office for Public Officers and Employees.** - All public officers and employees of the government before entering upon the discharge of their duties, shall take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution and the Bangsamoro Organic Law; that s/he will bear true faith and allegiance to it; obey the laws, legal orders and decrees promulgated by the duly constituted authorities; will faithfully discharge to the best of his/her ability the duties of the office or position upon which s/he is about to enter; and that s/he voluntarily assumes the obligation imposed by his/her oath of office, without mental reservation or purpose of evasion. Copies of the oath shall be deposited with the Civil Service Commission regional office and the human resource department of the concerned agency.

It is also mandatory to take the Oath of Moral Governance:

*“I swear to the Almighty Allah (God), the Most Supreme, the Beneficent, the Merciful, the All Knowing,*

*I shall perform my duties and responsibilities entrusted to me as part of the Bangsamoro Government with utmost dedication, devotion, honesty, justice, integrity, completely devoid of all the evils of governance especially graft and corruption.*

*I shall protect the legitimate rights and interest of all people in the area, strongly fight the proliferation and use of illegal drugs and other evils of society and endeavor to promote and sustain peace and security at all times in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region territory and in the entire country, so help me Allah (God)”.*

**WHEREAS,** since the launching of the Bangsamoro Job Portal, thousands of aspiring applicants have been screened, and as part of the Bangsamoro government’s mandate to uphold moral governance, it is important that all newly appointed employees should be guided by the moral virtues of mankind to ensure that they will perform their duties devoid of all evils of governance;

**WHEREAS,** this measure seeks to strengthen the call towards attainment of moral governance and likewise empower the Office of *Wali* in administering the prescribed oath of moral governance before the newly-appointed public officials and employees in the BARMM.

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to encourage all newly appointed employees to take their respective oath of moral governance before the office of the *Wali*.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER,** to forward this Resolution to the office of the Bangsamoro *Wali* and all Ministries in BARMM for information and appropriate consideration.
