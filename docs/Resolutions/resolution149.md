WHEREAS, the Mindanao State University (MSU) formerly known as University of Mindanao in Dansalan City (Marawi City) was founded on September 1, 1961 by virtue of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 1387, as amended by R.A. No. 3791;

WHEREAS, in addressing the so-called “Mindanao Problem”, MSU was established as an institution of higher learning through the initiative of late Sen. Ahmad Domocao "Domie" Alauya Alonto;

WHEREAS, being the second state university in the country and the first for Southern Philippines, the MSU, aside from discharging its regular functions of instruction, research and community extension services, was entrusted by Congress with two major objectives: to accelerate the integration of the Muslim population into the national body politic; and to provide the technical manpower needed for the economic and social development of the islands of Mindanao, Sulu and Palawan (MINSUPALA);

WHEREAS, from the mere 282 students for the collegiate level and 12 faculty members for the main campus, MSU has grown to a multi-campus supra-regional university system, serving over 69,000 students in all levels with nearly 3,100 faculty members and has expanded from one campus university in Marawi City to eight (8) autonomous campuses: MSU-Main in Marawi City, MSU-IIT in Iligan City, MSU-TCTO in Tawi-Tawi, MSU-Naawan in Misamis Oriental, MSU-Maguindanao, MSU-General Santos, MSU-Sulu in Jolo, and MSU Buug in Zamboanga Sibugay;

WHEREAS, because of increasing demands, there are now 16 major colleges offering 248 courses with MSU committed to set the standards of academic excellence being the only university directly charged by the government of integrating the cultural communities especially the Muslims into the mainstream of the nation’s socio-cultural and political life;

WHEREAS, since its inception, MSU’s operation promotes a laudable policy of inclusivity integrating the National Minorities through education and it is of common knowledge that the number of scholars enrolling is rapidly increasing indicating therein that more youths are drawn in the said State University for better quality education;

WHEREAS, on the occasion of its 60th Founding Anniversary, it is but proper to commemorate and commend its invaluable contributions towards the agro-industrial, ecological, socio-economic growth and political development of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region and the rest of Southern Philippines;

WHEREAS, Section 16, Article IX of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (R.A. No. 11054) provides that:
*Any school, college or university existing in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region as of the effectivity of this Organic Law, and such other schools and institutions that may be established hereinafter shall be deemed integral components of the educational system of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, and shall be governed by their respective charters. The National Government shall continue to support, enhance, and strengthen the Mindanao State University System.*

NOW, THEREFORE, be it
