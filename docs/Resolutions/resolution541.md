**WHEREAS**, Section 30, Article XIII of Republic Act No. 11054 or the *“Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao”*, states in part that the Bangsamoro Government shall promote awareness through the development and implementation of a *halal* campaign program, while the Parliament shall enact laws to further strengthen its policy programs on *halal* development;

**WHEREAS**, the freedom to act on one’s beliefs is the right and privilege of an individual to manifest his beliefs through external acts or omissions, provided such actions do not interfere with public safety, health, peace, or other compelling interest of society;

**WHEREAS**, many religions provide restrictions on the consumption of pork, such as Islam, some Christian denominations like the Seventh-day Adventist, and even Judaism;

**WHEREAS**, for Muslims, the Holy Qur’an has expressly prohibited the consumption of pork;

**WHEREAS**, there have been many instances of Muslims eating pork accidentally or mistakenly that had resulted in unfortunate incidents and squabbles;

**WHEREAS**, these incidents may be avoided if there is proper labeling or notice of *“With Pork”* or *“No Pork”* in food establishments;

**WHEREAS**, according to the 2020 census conducted by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), approximately six percent (6%) of the country’s population is Muslim;

**WHEREAS**, based on the 2015 Census of the population (2015 POPCEN), Mindanao had a total population of more than 24 million as of August 1, 2015, about 23.39% of which were reported to be followers of Islam. This indicated that in 2015, two in every ten (10) persons in Mindanao were Muslims;

**WHEREAS**, the Muslim population in Mindanao was concentrated in BARMM. About 91.28% of the total population of the region were Muslims;

**WHEREAS**, given the Muslim population in BARMM, it is only proper for all food establishments in the Bangsamoro Region to make a disclosure to their customers or patrons by means of signage on their menu and food display counters whether their food contains or does not contain pork;

**WHEREAS**, one of the effective ways to make such disclosure is by displaying a *“No Pork”* or *“With Pork”* signage on their menu and food display counters within their business establishments:
