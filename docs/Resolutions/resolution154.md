**THIRD REGULAR SESSION**

**RESOLUTION NO. 154**

**RESOLUTION COMMENDING THE SENATE OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES FOR APPROVING SENATE BILL NO. 2214 ON THIRD READING**

WHEREAS, Section 12 of Republic Act No. 11054 otherwise known as the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) states that immediately upon the election and qualification of the Chief Minister under the first Parliament, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority shall be deemed dissolved;

WHEREAS, Section 13 of the aforementioned law further provides that the first regular election for the Bangsamoro Government shall be held and synchronized with the 2022 national elections;

WHEREAS, members of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) assumed office in February 2019 and proceeded to conduct its affairs as the interim government of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, exercising its mandates, as provided in Republic Act No. 11054;

WHEREAS, while the Bangsamoro Transition Authority has taken significant strides in its service as the interim government in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, the effects of a lingering pandemic and lockdowns, the sheer weight of its mandate, coupled with shortfalls in resources and placed in the context of continued security threats, the three-year transition period is simply not enough to accomplish its targets;

WHEREAS, Senators Aquilino Martin "Koko" Pimentel III and Richard J. Gordon filed Senate Bill 2019 and Senate Bill 2025 on January 26, 2021 and January 27, 2021 respectively, to address the aforementioned concern, which bills were referred to the Senate Committee on Local Government chaired by Senator Francis "Tol" N. Tolentino;

WHEREAS, on May 20, 2021, the Senate Committee on Local Government consolidated the above-mentioned bills into Senate Bill No. 2214, providing to reset the First Regular Election of the Parliament in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to 2025;

WHEREAS, on September 6, 2021, Senate Bill No.2214 was approved on Third Reading by the Senate;

WHEREAS, the extension of the transition period will grant the Bangsamoro Transition Authority more time to fulfill its mandate and establish the system, institutions, policies, and bureaucracy that will serve as the foundation for the next regular government that will be responsive to the needs of the Bangsamoro people and that would do justice to the Bangsamoro struggle and the Peace Process:

NOW, THEREFORE, be it

RESOLVED, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to commend the Senate of the Republic of the Philippines under the able leadership of Senate President Vicente "Tito" C. Sotto for approving Senate Bill No. 2214 on Third Reading, the Committee on Local Government chaired by Senator Francis "Tol" Tolentino, and the Senate Majority Floor Leader Senator Juan Miguel "Migz" F. Zubiri, and all those in the Senate involved in the legislative process of its enactment.

RESOLVED FURTHER, to forward this Resolution to the office of the Senate President Vicente "Tito" C. Sotto for information.
