**RESOLUTION EXPRESSING FULL SUPPORT AND PROFOUND GRATITUDE TO PRESIDENT RODRIGO R. DUTERTE FOR HIS APPROVAL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SECURITY, JUSTICE AND PEACE CABINET CLUSTER TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE BANGSAMORO TRANSITION AUTHORITY**

**WHEREAS,** the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) is ordained with the solemn duty of acting as the steward of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) during its transition period, and is vested with legislative and executive powers to enact priority legislations, determine the parliamentary districts for the region’s first regular elections, organize and strengthen the bureaucracy of the Bangsamoro Government during the transition, facilitate the full transfer of powers, properties, and personnel of the previous Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to the Bangsamoro Government, and lead the smooth transition towards a new era of lasting peace in the region;

**WHEREAS,** under the Organic Law, the transition period was fixed to last until the dissolution of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, upon the first regular election for the Bangsamoro Government, originally set to be held and synchronized with the 2022 national elections;

**WHEREAS,** pursuant to R.A. No. 11593, the Organic Law was amended such that the first regular election for the Bangsamoro Government shall be held and synchronized with the 2025 national elections, and during this extended transition period, the BTA continues to be the interim government in the BARMM;

**WHEREAS,** pursuant to R.A. No. 11593, President Rodrigo R. Duterte was granted by Congress the power to appoint eighty (80) new interim members of the BTA who shall serve up to June 30, 2025 or until their successors shall have been elected and qualified;

**WHEREAS,** through Resolution No. 173 dated October 12, 2021, the BTA respectfully appealed to President Duterte to allow its incumbent Members to continue in service until 2025 by giving primary consideration to their diverse and ethnic-balanced composition, representing various peoples and sectors such as the religious sector, settlers, non-Moro IPs, traditional leaders, the academe, women, youth, peace advocates, former National Government officials, members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), former ARMM Government officials, technocrats, Career Executive Service eligible, and former BTC members who drafted the Organic Law and serve as repositories of its intent and spirit;

**WHEREAS,** through Resolution No. 209 dated February 15, 2022, the BTA respectfully reiterated its appeal to President Duterte to allow the incumbent Members to continue their service, highlighting the significant advantage in giving primary consideration to them for reappointment on account of their experience, training, skills, knowledge, and wisdom, in addition to the legislations, policies, programs, and advocacies they pursued and accomplished in accordance with the transition plan and peace process;

**WHEREAS,** through the cited Resolutions, the BTA emphasized that by allowing its Members to continue in their service, their preserved momentum will have a positive effect on the accomplishment of pending legislations, projects, and programs vital to the transition period, and prevent the disruption of public service;

**WHEREAS,** the Members of the BTA, acting as a collegial body, have tirelessly worked to fulfil not only the objectives of the Organic Law, but also to deliver on their mandate to the Bangsamoro people;

**WHEREAS,** since their appointment to the BTA, the incumbent Members have dutifully carried out their authority by enacting laws and implementing programs which are responsive to the needs of the Bangsamoro people, and by innovating progressive, forward-looking policies geared towards improving the overall quality of life in the region, anchored on the concept of moral governance;

**WHEREAS,** in the exercise of the President’s sole power to appoint the Members of the BTA, President Duterte approved on February 21, 2022 the recommendation of the Security, Justice and Peace Cabinet Cluster to maintain the *status quo* on the current composition of the BTA:
