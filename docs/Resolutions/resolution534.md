**RESOLUTION URGING THE MINISTRY OF BASIC, HIGHER, AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION TO REQUIRE THE MANDATORY POSTING OF NOTICES FOR GOVERNMENT-FUNDED EDUCATION SCHOLARSHIPS IN DESIGNATED PROMINENT AREAS IN ALL ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS WITHIN THE REGION**

**WHEREAS**, Section 1, Article XIV of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides that the State shall protect and promote the right of all citizens to quality education at all levels, and shall take appropriate steps to make such education accessible to all;

**WHEREAS**, in symmetry therewith, Section 8 of the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 18, otherwise known as the *“Bangsamoro Education Code of 2021”*, declares that the Bangsamoro Government shall promote and protect the constitutional right of all to quality and accessible education at all levels and to establish, maintain, and support a complete, adequate, and integrated system of education relevant and responsive to the needs, ideals, and aspirations of the Bangsamoro people;

**WHEREAS**, among the principles observed by the Bangsamoro Education Code, as provided under Section 9 thereof, are inclusivity and equity, emphasizing that everyone shall have access to quality education regardless of beliefs, cultures, ethnicities, genders, needs, abilities, or socio-economic backgrounds and that those who have less in life shall receive more in educational services and opportunities;

**WHEREAS**, government-funded education scholarships support and enhance the educational opportunities of eligible students by mitigating financial barriers;

**WHEREAS**, it has been observed that information about government-funded education scholarships is not always effectively disseminated to all potential beneficiaries, leaving some students unaware of available funding opportunities;

**WHEREAS**, most of the time, information relevant to government-funded education is disseminated through social media platforms, depriving many potential beneficiaries, especially those living in remote areas with limited or no internet access, of this information;

**WHEREAS**, effective dissemination of information regarding these scholarships is crucial to ensuring that all potential beneficiaries are aware of and can access these opportunities;

**WHEREAS**, it is the mandate of the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education (MBHTE) to formulate, plan, implement, and coordinate education policies, plans, programs, and projects in the areas of formal and non-formal education at all levels; to supervise all educational institutions, both public and private; and to provide for the establishment, maintenance, and support of a complete, adequate, and integrated system of education that is relevant and responsive to the needs, ideals, and aspirations of the Bangsamoro people;

**WHEREAS**, vested under Section 14 of the Bangsamoro Education Code of 2021 is the power of the Minister of the MBHTE to promulgate rules and regulations, which are necessary to carry out the Ministry’s objectives, policies, functions, plans, programs, and projects;

**WHEREAS**, there is a need to establish a formalized process to ensure that information about government-funded education scholarships is consistently and clearly communicated to students within post-secondary educational institutions;

**WHEREAS**, it is well within the MBHTE’s objectives and its tagline, *“Bangsamoro United: Education Without Exception”*, to ensure that scholarships are awarded to their intended beneficiaries by making sure they are informed of the scholarship programs being implemented:

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, To urge the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education to require the mandatory posting of notices for government-funded education scholarships in designated prominent areas of all academic institutions within the region.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, To forward the foregoing Resolution to the Ministry of Basic Higher and Technical Education for their information and appropriate action.
