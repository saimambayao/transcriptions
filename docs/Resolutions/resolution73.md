**WHEREAS**, on 8 March 2020, President Rodrigo R. Duterte issued Proclamation No. 922, declaring a state of public health emergency throughout the Philippines due to the outbreak of the Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) and enjoining all government agencies and local government units to “render full assistance and cooperation, and mobilize the necessary resources to undertake critical, urgent, and appropriate response and measures in a timely manner to curtail and eliminate the COVID-19 threat;”

**WHEREAS**, on 11 May 2020, the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases convened to analyze current scientific data and apply the parameters to determine the appropriate community quarantine or social distancing measures that should be implemented in different provinces, highly-urbanized cities (HUCs), and independent component cities (ICCs) in the country;

**WHEREAS**, pursuant to Resolution No. 41, s. 2020 issued by the IATF, beginning 01 June 2020, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) which consists of the Provinces of Basilan, Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, and Cotabato City shall be placed under Modified General Community Quarantine (MGCQ);

**WHEREAS**, based on the Omnibus Guidelines on the Implementation of Community Quarantine in the Philippines, work in all public offices in areas placed under MGCQ may be allowed to resume physical reporting to work at full operating capacity, with alternative work arrangements for persons who are sixty (60) years old and above, those with immunodeficiency, co-morbidity, or other health risks, and pregnant women;

**WHEREAS**, mass gatherings in areas placed under MGCQ shall be allowed provided that participants shall be limited to fifty percent (50%) of the venue or seating capacity;

**WHEREAS**, despite government interventions, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 continues to rise, with the latest count of confirmed cases at fifteen thousand five hundred eighty eight (15,588) as of 28 May 2020, and this is expected to continuously increase following the broadening of the country’s capacity to test more patients nationwide;

**WHEREAS**, the imposition of MGCQ in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region and its attendant limitations should not prevent the Bangsamoro Parliament from exercising its legal mandate to enact laws and authorize appropriations, especially those necessary for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Government to respond to this pandemic while ensuring the safety and well-being of the Bangsamoro throughout the country;

**WHEREAS**, Section 25, Article VII of the Bangsamoro Organic Law allows the Parliament to adopt its own rules for the conduct of its business;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Parliament, to amend Section 5, Rule VI; Section 2, Rule VIII; and Section 4, Rule XIII of Parliament Resolution No. 6, to read as follows:

“For the same reasons and the same procedure provided under Section 5, Rule VI, the committee may conduct meetings or hearings through teleconference, video conference, or other reliable forms of remote or electronic means, using appropriate information and communications technology systems due to force majeure or occurrence of an emergency which may prevent members from physically attending the committee meetings or hearings.
