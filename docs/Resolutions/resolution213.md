**WHEREAS**, under Section 5, Article II of the 1987 Constitution, it is declared that the maintenance of peace and order, the protection of life, liberty, and property, and the promotion of the general welfare are essential for the enjoyment by all the people of the blessings of democracy;

**WHEREAS**, under Section 2(s) Article V, of R.A. 11054, otherwise known as the “Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL)”, the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise its authority over matters involving disaster risk reduction and management, without prejudice to the general supervision by the President of the Republic of the Philippines;

**WHEREAS**, it is also provided under Section 3, Article V of the BOL that “the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants”;

**WHEREAS**, Section 5(a), Article VII, of the BOL provides that the Parliament shall have the power to “enact laws to promote, protect, and ensure the general welfare of the Bangsamoro people and other inhabitants in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region”;

**WHEREAS**, Section 7, Article XIII, of the BOL declares that the Bangsamoro Government “recognizes the importance of disaster risk reduction and management and climate change adaptation”;

**WHEREAS**, the same provision mandates the formulation of the Bangsamoro Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan, which shall complement that of the National Government;

**WHEREAS**, disaster resilience is defined as the ability of individuals, communities, organizations and states to adapt to and recover from hazards, shocks or stresses without compromising long-term prospects for development;

**WHEREAS**, according to the Hyogo Framework for Action, disaster resilience is determined by the degree to which individuals, communities and public and private organizations are capable of organizing themselves to learn from past disasters and reduce their risks to future ones, at international, regional, national and local levels;

**WHEREAS**, the Ready to Rebuild: Disaster Rehabilitation and Recovery Program is a joint program of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC)-Office of Civil Defense (OCD) and the World Bank to help national and local governments prepare for recovery even before disaster happens;

**WHEREAS**, disaster risk reduction is integral to our development, and the importance of a risk-informed and risk-resilient environment is recognized by the following three global policy frameworks and international agreements:

(a) the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030;

(b) the United Nations (UN) Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals; and

(c) the Paris Agreement within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Moreover, at the regional level, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) community has ratified the Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response (AADMER) in support of the global policy frameworks.

**WHEREAS**, the Philippines is a signatory or party to these global policy frameworks and agreements, and it is committed to minimizing the loss of lives and resources due to disasters. Thus, R.A. 10121 or the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010 was passed, and the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (NDRRM) Framework and Plan was prepared as among the concrete steps towards safer, adaptive, and disaster-resilient Filipino communities;

**WHEREAS**, under Section 2 of R.A. 10121, it is the declared policy of the State to:

(d) Adopt a disaster risk reduction and management approach that is holistic, comprehensive, integrated, and proactive in lessening the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of disasters including climate change, and promote the involvement and participation of all sectors and stakeholders concerned, at all levels, especially the local community;

(g) Mainstream disaster risk reduction and climate change in development processes such as policy formulation, socioeconomic development planning, budgeting, and governance, particularly in the areas of environment, agriculture, water, energy, health, education, poverty reduction, land-use and urban planning, and public infrastructure and housing, among others.

**WHEREAS**, the national government’s Department of the Interior and Local Government recognizes the enactment of R.A. 10121 as having laid down the basis for a paradigm shift from just disaster preparedness and response to disaster risk reduction and management;

**WHEREAS**, disaster risk management is one of the ways to secure the general welfare and future of the Bangsamoro. Thus, proactive measures on such, especially on recovery and rehabilitation, should be a priority for line agencies and LGUs.;

**WHEREAS**, one of the proactive measures that can be done is annual participation in the Ready to Rebuild Program for people in such line agencies and LGUs. Such program covers pre- and post-disaster activities from gathering disaster data, formulating rehabilitation and recovery plan and its subsequent financing and implementation, facilitating emergency procurement, crafting a communications strategy, and instituting monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. It will simulate the disaster rehabilitation and recovery planning process even before a disaster happens. The conduct of its activities will contribute to expediting the recovery planning and implementation processes;

**WHEREAS**, with such participation in such program, the appropriate agencies and LGUs will have the technical know-how and be able to effectively prepare a Recovery and Rehabilitation Plan using the standard guidelines;

**WHEREAS**, GeoRisk Philippines (GeoRiskPH) is a multi-agency initiative led by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS), funded by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), and monitored by the Philippine Council for Industry, Energy, and Emerging Technology Research and Development (PCIEERD) from 2018 to 2020. It has been institutionalized in DOST-PHIVOLCS since 2021;

**WHEREAS**, given the above, another proactive measure is engagement with the national government’s Department of Science and Technology (DOST) for continuous geo-risk data-sharing, training and its application. Trainings and workshops on the use of GeoriskPH platforms may be attended to by agencies and LGUs in order to build and manage the agencies’ or local governments’ geospatial data for climate and disaster resilience, DRRM planning, and land use planning:

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to urge the Government of the Day, through the MILG, BPDA, and MOST, to encourage the line agencies and LGUs to undertake proactive measures on Disaster Risk Reduction and Management especially on recovery and rehabilitation.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, to forward the foregoing Resolution to the OCD and the World Bank for consideration and participation of the Bangsamoro line agencies and local government units in the Ready to Rebuild Program, and to the DOST Central Office for possible partnership with MOST-BARMM for the implementation and utilization of GeoRiskPH in the Bangsamoro Region.
