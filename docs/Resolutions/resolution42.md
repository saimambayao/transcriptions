**RESOLUTION NO. 42**

**RESOLUTION URGING THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH TO PRIORITIZE AND INTENSIFY PROGRAMS ON POLIO PREVENTION FOLLOWING THE OUTBREAK IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM)**

**WHEREAS**, poliomyelitis or polio is a fatal and highly infectious disease caused by polio virus. Polio can be contracted when there is poor environmental sanitation. The poliovirus attacks the nervous system and in worst cases leads to irreversible paralysis. Children under five years of age are most vulnerable to the disease;

**WHEREAS**, polio is endemic in regions where public health and immunization services remain poor and unprovided;

**WHEREAS**, the Philippines had been declared polio-free since October 2000 with the last case of polio virus reported in 1993;

**WHEREAS**, on September 19, 2019, the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the reemergence of polio and announced an outbreak of polio in the country after a poliovirus was confirmed in an unvaccinated 3-year-old girl from Lanao del Sur;

**WHEREAS**, the DOH confirmed another polio case a day after in a 5-year-old boy from Laguna province. In addition, environmental samples from the populace of Manila and Davao also tested positive for poliovirus. This prompted DOH officials in Davao City to warn its residents by advising them to refrain from swimming in the river;

**WHEREAS**, the polio outbreak calls for an urgent action from the government to protect the children from being infected. Complete vaccination is the best measure against polio. It requires that children under one (1) year old should complete their three (3) doses of Oral Polio Virus Vaccine (OPV) and one (1) dose of the Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV);

**WHEREAS**, the World Health Organization (WHO) declares that OPV is proven safe and effective, saving millions of lives from the polio virus. Since its introduction in 1988, the number of polio cases has declined by over 99 percent;

**WHEREAS**, there are a number of Muslim parents who refuse or are reluctant to have their children vaccinated, but who must be informed of its importance;

**WHEREAS**, it is a declared policy of the Bangsamoro Government to protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them;

**WHEREAS**, the Ministry of Health is the agency mandated to promote, protect, preserve or restore the health of the people through the provision and delivery of health services, and the regulation and encouragement of providers of health goods and services attuned to and in pursuance of Islamic faith and teachings;

**WHEREAS**, consistent with its mandate, the Ministry of Health should ensure that synchronized polio vaccination programs are planned and implemented effectively, developed and disseminated with the appropriate risk communication messages, casted investigation and tracing activities with enhanced surveillance and procurement of required vaccine supplies for campaigns in the region;

**WHEREAS**, in the performance of its mandate, the Ministry of Health is not precluded from using *fatwa* or Islamic Ruling, on immunization to address the concerns of Muslim parents over the legitimacy of vaccination;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Parliament, the Ministry of Health is urged to conduct an intensive education and immunization campaign in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to eradicate and contain the polio outbreak.

**Adopted**, October 17, 2019.
