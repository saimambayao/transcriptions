**RESOLUTION RESPECTFULLY URGING THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS BODY TO RELEASE INFORMATION, CONDUCT STUDIES, AND INVITE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE COURSE OF RESOLVING THE BUDGETARY TRANSITION FOR THE PROVINCE OF SULU**

**WHEREAS**, Section 7, Article III of the 1987 Philippine Constitution declares that the right of the people to information on matters of public concern shall be recognized. Access to official records, documents, and papers pertaining to official acts, transactions, or decisions, as well as to government research data used as basis for policy development, shall be afforded the citizen, subject to such limitations as may be provided by law;

**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Article VI of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the *“Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao,”* provides for the creation of an Intergovernmental Relations Body (IGRB) to coordinate and resolve issues between the National Government and the Bangsamoro Government through regular consultation and continuing negotiation in a non-adversarial manner;

**WHEREAS**, the Province of Sulu, by virtue of the Supreme Court Decision dated September 09, 2024, and Resolution dated November 26, 2024, is currently undergoing a unique transition concerning the governance, financial allocation, and administrative framework of the province;

**WHEREAS**, the impending transition of Sulu out of the jurisdiction of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) has raised structural concerns regarding the continuity of public services, the protection of employment for Tausug and other Sulu-based government workers, and the funding of programs, activities, and projects previously administered by the Bangsamoro Government;

**WHEREAS**, in light of this transition, several Tausug public servants and residents have expressed apprehension over the absence of clear guidance or concrete plans from the IGRB or the National Government, particularly with regard to the continuity of salaries, delivery of essential services, and implementation of regional programs;

**WHEREAS**, various provincial offices and agencies operating in Sulu, have reportedly not been consulted or included in any formal budget planning activities for Fiscal Year 2026, thereby risking their exclusion from the budgetary processes of both the National Government and the Bangsamoro Government;

**WHEREAS**, it is in the interest of moral governance, public accountability, and respect for the principles of autonomy and consensus-building that the Tausug people be consulted and informed on the details of the ongoing transition;

**WHEREAS**, the chairman of the IGRB is requested to provide the membership of the Technical Working Group (TWG) on Sulu:

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved, by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, in session duly assembled, to respectfully urge the Intergovernmental Relations Body (IGRB) to:

1. Release timely and accurate information regarding the current status and direction of the transition plans for the Province of Sulu;
2. Conduct comprehensive technical and policy studies on the fiscal, administrative, and employment implications of Sulu’s transition;
3. Invite relevant stakeholders, including especially affected Tausug employees and community representatives, to actively participate in discussions, consultations, and planning activities; and
4. Ensure that the concerns of the Tausug people are duly considered and reflected in all transition-related decisions and policies, particularly those affecting public employment, fiscal allocations, and service delivery.

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, To furnish a copy of this resolution to the Intergovernmental Relations Body (IGRB), the Office of the President, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), and all other relevant ministries, agencies and offices, for their appropriate information and action.
