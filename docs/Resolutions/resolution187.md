WHEREAS, the current manual method of payroll system, considering the foregoing huge amount of personnel services, is cumbersome to both the Bangsamoro civil servants and the assigned disbursement officers because this manual system is outdated and inefficient, risky and prone to danger, and impractical and inconvenient to civil servants;

WHEREAS, the practice of picking up a sizeable amount of cash of salaries and related benefits from the Cashier’s Office and transporting the same to the external offices to physically deliver them one-by-one personally to the concerned staff poses high risk to the life and security of the designated representatives;

WHEREAS, the manual payroll system also presents a huge burden on the part of the BTA Cashier’s Office in manually counting tens to hundreds of millions of cash every month wherefore exponentially increasing the margin of error on their part;

WHEREAS, there was an instance when due, to inadvertence, the BTA Cashier’s Office, which manifested its support to this resolution, had Twelve Thousand Pesos (P12,000) salary deficit on July 2021 payroll payout which they personally covered;

WHEREAS, an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) of government depositary as a payroll system is convenient to all concerned, both the disbursement officers and the civil servant recipients; this will eliminate risk of loss and it will attain and ensure greater efficiency, economy, transparency, and accountability in the handling of public fund and human resource processes, reduce redundancy and paperwork and cut red tape in the processing of government payroll, optimize government cash flow, and enable employees to receive their salaries real time, anywhere and anytime especially for those working in remote areas such as Lanao Del Sur and the Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi;

WHEREAS, the upgrading from manual to automated payroll system will certainly resolve the stated issues and will do more good than bad to the Members of the Parliament;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Civil Service Code refers to moral governance as a set of rules, practices, and processes completely devoid of all evils of graft and corruption, and explicitly driven by the moral principles of utmost dedication, devotion, honesty, justice, integrity, and excellence (ihsaan):
