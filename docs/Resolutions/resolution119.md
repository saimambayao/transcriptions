**SECOND REGULAR SESSION**

**RESOLUTION NO. 119**

**RESOLUTION URGING THE PROFESSIONAL REGULATION COMMISSION (PRC) TO CREATE A REGIONAL OFFICE WITHIN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM)**

**WHEREAS,** Section 2 of Republic Act No. 8981, known as the “PRC Modernization Act of 2000” provides that “the State recognizes the important role of professionals in nation-building and, towards this end, promotes the sustained development of a reservoir of professionals whose competence has been determined by honest and credible licensure examination and whose standards of professional service and practice are internationally recognized and considered world-class brought about by the regulatory measures, programs and activities that foster professional growth and advancement”;

**WHEREAS,** The Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) is a government entity mandated to administer, implement and enforce the regulatory laws and policies of the country with respect to the regulation and licensing of the various professions and occupations under its jurisdiction, including the enhancement and maintenance of professional and occupational standards and ethics and the enforcement of the rules and regulations relative thereto;

**WHEREAS,** as published in their official website, the PRC serves millions of professionals from more than 40 various regulated professions and the hundreds of thousands of aspiring professionals who take the licensure examinations every year, including those coming from BARMM areas. Thus, PRC stakeholders include the professionals, would-be professionals, accredited professional organizations, foreign professionals seeking temporary permit to practice their professions in the country, schools and academe, and other government agencies;

**WHEREAS,** due to the indispensability of PRC services and the congestion of clients in its existing offices, creation of PRC sub-offices, such as regional offices and satellite offices, are projected to be established;

**WHEREAS,** the authority to create and operationalize PRC regional offices is vested in the commission by virtue of Section 8 of Republic Act No. 8981, the “PRC Modernization Act of 2000,” which provides that the “PRC is authorized to create regional offices as may be necessary to carry out their functions as mandated”;

**WHEREAS,** to better carry out its mandate and in order to implement the provisions of “PRC Modernization Act of 2000” as abovementioned, PRC has been expressing its commitment to ensure accessibility and timely delivery of services to its clients, primarily through the establishment of regional offices across the country;

**WHEREAS,** up to this date, however, there has been no PRC regional office or even a satellite office set-up within BARMM region. PRC stakeholders or clients coming from BARMM have to go to neighboring regions where PRC offices exist, to carry-out their transactions with the commission;

**WHEREAS,** creating a PRC Regional Office within BARMM will enable PRC to efficiently and effectively carry out its mandate and commitment to ensure timely delivery of its services, particularly to its stakeholders residing within BARMM;

**WHEREAS,** it is enshrined in the Bangsamoro Organic Law that the Bangsamoro Government is mandated to exercise powers that are necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. It commits, among other things, to encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities and to preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants;

**WHEREAS,** the Bangsamoro Government must endeavor to realize the establishment of PRC Regional Office within BARMM as this will save PRC stakeholders residing within the region their hard-earned money, time, and effort, especially that many of them, such as the medical practitioners, have to go to PRC every year or two to renew their licenses or do other related transactions with the commission;

**WHEREAS,** recognizing the indispensability of PRC services and in light of the demand for its operation and existence within the region, the establishment of PRC Regional Office within BARMM must be given precedence;

**WHEREAS,** the establishment of the Professional Regulation Commission Regional Office will help the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in the enhancement and maintenance of professional and occupational standard and ethics of the Bangsamoro professionals;

**WHEREAS,** the Ministry of Labor and Employment of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao is currently meeting its counterpart, the Department of Labor and Employment and its attached agencies on the establishment of the PRC BARMM;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to urge the Professional Regulation Commission to create and operationalize a PRC Regional Office within BARMM, this being within the commission’s authority as mandated by the PRC Modernization Act of 2000 or Republic Act No. 8981.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER,** to forward this Resolution to the main office of the Professional Regulation Commission, the Office of the President, the Department of Labor and Employment, the Inter-Governmental Relations (IGR) and the Bangsamoro Ministry of Labor and Employment for information and appropriate consideration.

**ADOPTED,** March 25, 2021.
