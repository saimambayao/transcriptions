**3 Mindsets to Ten X Your Odds of Startup Success**

**Introduction: The Reality of Startup Failure**

**00:00**
Launching a startup has become a lot cheaper and easier than before, but most startups still face dismal odds of success. In this video, I’m going to outline three mindsets I’ve learned over the years as a founder that could help you 10x your odds of success.

**00:14**
Hi there, if you’re new to this channel, my name is Ash Maurya. I’m an entrepreneur and author and the creator of the one-page business modeling tool, Lean Canvas. On this channel, I share systematic strategies and techniques for starting and growing a business.

**Defining and Measuring Success**

**00:27**
Now, since this video is about increasing startup odds of success, let's start by defining how we are going to measure startup success. An idea typically takes seven to ten years on average to reach its full potential, but I’m not going to use that as the success milestone for a couple of reasons.

**00:43**
First, because different founders have different definitions of success. Some people value freedom and want to build a small company that gives them autonomy, while others value power and may want to build a thousand-person company or a unicorn.

**00:57**
Now, while I think it’s critical to get clear on what type of founder you are before getting too deep into the startup game—I’ve linked another video here where I take on that topic in case you’re interested—but irrespective of how you define your idea’s full potential, all ideas go through a pivotal inflection point which also serves as a reliable leading indicator of success.

**01:17**
And that is Product/Market Fit. Now, Product/Market Fit is another one of those overloaded terms with many varying definitions out there. So to keep things simple, I’m going to define it as the inflection point in the hockey stick when a business model starts to work repeatedly and is ready to transition into scale.

**The Probability of Failure**

**01:35**
According to data from some of the top accelerators and investors, and from my own experience building products and coaching teams, it takes roughly two years to achieve Product/Market Fit, and 80% of products never get there.

**01:47**
Now, this two-year Product/Market Fit rule isn’t absolute, but it is a good rule of thumb that you can witness in both solopreneur-type businesses as well as VC-backed unicorns. And an 80% failure rate means that only 20%, or one in five startups, will get to Product/Market Fit.

**Mindset 1: Separate Your Success From Your Idea**

**02:08**
So how do we improve these odds? This brings us to the first mindset. The first mindset is separating your success as a founder from that of your idea. Too many founders over-index on their initial idea, but it has been shown statistically that most initial ideas don't work.

**02:20**
More than two-thirds of all successful startups report drastically changing their initial idea along the way. And so what that means is that what separates successful founders then isn't necessarily starting with a perfect idea or a Plan A, but finding a better Plan B or C or Z before running out of resources.

**02:40**
And because good ideas are rare, you have to be prepared to go through lots of ideas and realize that most of them are going to be bad versus good ones. The challenge, of course, is that all ideas sound equally amazing and crazy at the beginning, and so it’s not easy to tell good ideas from bad ones.

**02:59**
And that is your true job as a founder. Your job isn’t to make your original idea work, but rather find an idea that can turn into a repeatable and scalable business model. You increase your odds of success when you can vet good ideas from bad ideas quickly, which brings us to the second mindset.

**Mindset 2: Shorten Your Idea Cycle Time**

**03:14**
Shorten your idea cycle time. Idea cycle time is the time window or runway you give each idea before you kill it off and move on to another one, or pivot the same idea to something better. Waiting too long to pivot away from a bad idea is another one of those top contributors to startup failure.

**03:32**
Now, while I agree that Product/Market Fit is a significant milestone for a startup, I don’t recommend using it for your idea cycle time because two years is still too long.

**03:42**
If you gave each of your ideas two years of runway to achieve Product/Market Fit, with a 20% success rate, you would think it would take up to five idea cycles or 10 years on average to find one successful idea that hits Product/Market Fit.

**The Math of Increasing Your Odds**

**03:55**
It’s actually a lot worse than that. As Benny Haus reminded me after my first take on this video, this is not how probabilities work. You can look up the math yourself on this page, and here’s how the numbers actually play out:

1. In 10 years, your success rate doesn't go up to 100%, but just 67%.
2. For an 80% success rate, you would need 14 years.
3. To hit a 90% success rate, you would need 21 years.
4. And in order to hit a 95% success rate, you would need 27 years.

**04:27**
In professional sports betting, 55% is considered a great success rate. VCs use a 10% success rate across their portfolios. But in both of these cases, betting is done with a leveraged asset: money. As a founder, you bet with your time, which you can never get back.

**04:44**
Plus, there is opportunity cost. While you’re working on your startup, you aren’t working on other things. For these reasons, I recommend being much more conservative and stricter about your odds and basing your calculations on the 90% success rate scenario.

**04:59**
One way to increase your overall success rate is to shorten your idea cycle time. This would allow you to fit more idea iterations into the same window, and you take more shots on goal.

**The 90-Day Cycle and Problem/Solution Fit**

**05:10**
How short could you make the idea cycle time? How about 90 days, or three months? It's obvious that 90 days is a lot shorter than two years, but it's still long enough to test some of the riskiest assumptions in any idea. This is where a different milestone comes in: Problem/Solution Fit.

**05:27**
Compared to Product/Market Fit, which takes two years to achieve, you can achieve Problem/Solution Fit with any type of idea in just 90 days. This means that instead of testing one idea in a two-year period, you could potentially test up to eight ideas in that same timeframe.

**05:43**
If we assume that the success rate of each idea iteration stays the same at 20%, shrinking your idea cycle time by 8x increases your odds of success also by 8x.

**Mindset 3: Invalidate Bad Ideas Quickly**

**06:03**
Now, granted, Problem/Solution Fit does not address all the same risks as Product/Market Fit, and an idea can still fail post-Problem/Solution Fit. I still argue that your overall success rate goes up by an order of magnitude, and here’s why.

**06:09**
From earlier, Product/Market Fit is a measure of a working business model ready for scaling. To achieve Product/Market Fit, you need to have a product with demonstrable traction that addresses a big enough monetizable problem in a big enough market.

**06:23**
Problem/Solution Fit, on the other hand, is a measure of a business model ready for a new product. In other words, it helps you sidestep one of the top contributors to startup failure: building a product that doesn’t address a big enough problem, or a product that no one or not enough people want.

**06:39**
And this brings us to the final mindset, mindset number three: Invalidate bad ideas quickly. The tangible deliverable from Problem/Solution Fit is getting you to an evidence-based go/no-go decision on a new idea in 90 days.

**The Modern Challenge: "Should We Build It?"**

**06:53**
You do this by recognizing that the risk profile of startups has changed. Going back a decade, building products used to be hard and difficult and expensive. This isn't the case today. Given enough time, money, and effort, we can build almost anything these days.

**07:08**
The challenge for most startups today isn't "Can we build it?" but rather "Should we build it?" The counterintuitive insight here is that you don't need a working product or an MVP to answer this question.

**07:15**
And when you do answer this question favorably, you go from hoping people will buy your product to knowing that they will. Customer and market risks are far more critical for most startups today to address upfront than technical or product risks.

**The Power of the Demo-Sell-Build Process**

**07:39**
Think of Problem/Solution Fit as validating demand for a product before wasting needless time, money, and effort building something nobody wants and burning through your idea cycle time.

**07:49**
When you don’t achieve Problem/Solution Fit with an idea, you don’t simply give up and kill off that idea. You always end up with evidence on why the idea didn’t work, which helps you either pivot to a better idea or avoid going down a dead-end path that would never work.

**08:07**
Now, when you do achieve Problem/Solution Fit, success or achieving Product/Market Fit isn’t guaranteed because you could still fumble on the execution of your product. But while you’ll still have real product risks, these risks are a lot lower than the customer and market risks you should have mitigated.

**Developing the Traction-First Skillset**

**08:25**
In the last calculation, I kept the idea iteration success rate the same at 20%, but in practice, that number is a lot higher. This is because you aren't building a working product during Problem/Solution Fit, but using a "demo-sell-build" process. It's much faster to iterate on a demo than a working product.

**08:44**
That said, I would still allocate up to two 90-day cycles for the Problem/Solution Fit stage. This comes from data we have collected from thousands of teams who have gone through our flagship Bootstart program, which covers that journey from idea through Problem/Solution Fit.

**09:17**
Mindsets and skillsets needed to achieve Problem/Solution Fit are very different from how people have traditionally been taught to build products. For instance, you don't start with a "build-first" approach but a "traction-first" approach.

**09:31**
You don't build a product and then try to sell it; you learn to sell before you build. And most importantly, you have to start with a business model that has a fighting chance of hitting your definition of success, or there is no point in pursuing the idea in the first place.

**Closing and Next Steps**

**09:45**
Mindset change, like habit change, doesn't happen overnight. Like a good tea, some steeping time is required. This is why some students take a few days, but others need a few weeks to internalize this new way of working.

**09:58**
Now, even when students learn how to vet good ideas quickly, the most common result we see is that they end up killing their first bad idea—because, remember, good ideas are rare and hard to find.

**10:10**
This is still a success in my book because not only do they avoid going down a dead-end path sooner, but more importantly, they learn how to search for a better idea next, which always goes a lot faster the second time around.

**10:21**
If we assume it can take up to two 90-day cycles to get to Problem/Solution Fit, that gets us to the six-month point. At this point, you have validated demand for your product, and your primary risks shift to product execution. If you manage these cycles well, you should be able to hit Product/Market Fit within the two-year mark.


### **Organized Notes**

**1. Redefining Startup Success**
*   **[00:27] The Timeline:** A startup typically takes 7–10 years to reach full potential.
*   **[01:17] Product/Market Fit (PMF):** The point where a business model works repeatedly and is ready to scale.
*   **[01:47] The 80% Rule:** Roughly 80% of startups fail to reach PMF, with the average attempt taking 2 years.

**2. Mindset 1: Separate Your Success From Your Idea**
*   **[02:08] Idea Agnosticism:** Your identity as a successful founder is independent of your initial "Plan A." 
*   **[02:20] The Statistical Pivot:** 2/3 of successful startups drastically change their initial idea. Success is about finding Plan B or C before resources run out.

**3. Mindset 2: Shorten Your Idea Cycle Time**
*   **[03:14] Definition:** Idea cycle time is the runway given to an idea before deciding to kill or pivot.
*   **[03:55] Probability Realities:** 
    *   One 2-year cycle offers only a 20% success rate. 
    *   To reach a 90% confidence level of success using 2-year cycles, you would need **21 years**.
*   **[05:10] The 90-Day Target:** Shortening the cycle to 3 months allows for 8 iterations in 2 years, theoretically 10X-ing your success odds.

**4. Mindset 3: Invalidate Bad Ideas Quickly**
*   **[05:27] Problem/Solution Fit (PSF):** A 90-day milestone that validates a business model *before* building a product.
*   **[07:08] The Modern Question:** Shifting from *"Can we build it?"* (technical risk) to *"Should we build it?"* (market risk).
*   **[07:39] Validate Before Building:** PSF ensures there is actual demand, sidestepping the #1 cause of failure: building something nobody wants.

**5. Tactical Shifts for Founders**
*   **[09:27] Traction-First:** Prioritize demonstrating traction over building features.
*   **[09:31] Sell Before You Build:** Use the "demo-sell-build" process to iterate on customer feedback without the cost of a full MVP.
*   **[09:37] Business Model Priority:** Ensure the model itself can hit your goals before committing years to the execution.
