**The Innovator’s Gift: Uncovering Your True Competition**

**Introduction: The Innovator’s Gift Mental Model**

**00:00**
So a few weeks ago I shared a video on what startup founders get wrong about competition where I introduced my Innovator’s Gift mental model. In that video I made three assertions:

**00:11**
1. Every successful product, no matter how disruptive or innovative, always has competition when it enters the market.

**00:19**
2. Innovation is fundamentally about causing a switch from the competition to your product.

**00:25**
3. The best way to cause this switch is by positioning differently against this competition.

**00:31**
At the end of that video I issued a challenge. I asked viewers to challenge these assertions, especially the first one, by trying to find a product at any time in history that was so disruptive or innovative that it had no competition. Here are the top responses I got: the automobile, the wheel, space travel, vaccines, and fire.

**00:48**
In this video I'm going to show you how to apply the Innovator's Gift model to these products and share some additional techniques for uncovering your true competition. So let’s dive in.

**00:58**
But first, if you're new to this channel, my name is Ash Maurya. I'm an entrepreneur and author and the creator of the one-page business modeling tool Lean Canvas. On this channel I share systematic strategies and techniques for starting and growing a business.

**Defining Innovation vs. Invention**

**01:12**
The first thing you'll notice in this list is that they all represent the introduction of a new invention. Inventions are new methods or technologies that live in the solution context.

**01:23**
The premise behind the Innovator's Gift is that innovation is all about applying new inventions to solve existing problems created by existing alternatives. And in order to uncover these existing alternatives you have to transcend the solution context and move to a much bigger context.

**01:42**
You do this by first asking, “What's it for?” or “What's the use case or job that customers are trying to do?” Then you look for the most popular existing solution that people are currently using to get the job done. And that’s where you'll find the true competition.

**Case Study 1: The Automobile**

**02:02**
Next let’s apply the three steps to this list. What was the use case for automobiles when they were first introduced? Sure, it was for transportation.

**02:10**
And before automobiles, how did people do this before? They either walked or used horse-drawn carriages when they wanted to go further or faster.

**02:18**
Even though this is an often misattributed Henry Ford quote, it captures the essence of the positioning that automobiles had when they anchored against the horse-drawn carriage, which is the true competition in this story: "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses."

**02:31**
The first automobiles were faster and I would argue a cleaner means of transportation than a horse-drawn carriage and the first early adopters of automobiles weren't people moving from walking to automobiles but most likely from horse-drawn carriages to automobiles. It's also no coincidence that we still use the term horsepower as a measure of performance for cars to this day.

**Case Study 2: The Wheel**

**02:54**
Now the wheel is an interesting one. You might think that the use case here is also transportation related but the wheel was used for hundreds of years for a completely different job, which wasn't for transportation. Can you guess what that was?

**03:08**
Yes, the wheel was used to make pots with a pottery wheel. Before the pottery wheel, people made pots by hand, which was laborious and time-consuming. The true competition here was the manual pot-making process and the pottery wheel represented a significant breakthrough.

**03:24**
Then hundreds of years later, someone had the insight to also use the wheel for moving heavy objects and a new use case or job was born. This is a good illustration of how the same technology can have multiple jobs or use cases, and insights that often seem so obvious in hindsight aren't all that obvious because we live our lives looking forward.

**Case Study 3: Space Travel**

**03:47**
Okay so let’s keep moving down this list. What about space travel? The use case here is exploration. As a civilization we have always been explorers. That is how we migrated from the cradle of life in Africa to populate the planet, inventing all kinds of technologies along the way to navigate both land and sea.

**04:06**
Space is no different. We have been looking up at the stars for centuries and have invented things like telescopes, rockets, satellites, and rovers to explore space and the planets from a distance.

**04:18**
The furthest though we have been able to go physically is the moon but now some private companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic are building new technologies that promise to take us even further. It's again no coincidence that we still use terms like ships, which came from navigation, to describe these vessels as spaceships.

**Case Study 4: Vaccines**

**04:39**
The next one here is vaccines. And the use case here is fighting or preventing a disease or infection. Before vaccines when people got sick we would socially distance them and let their immune system try to fight off the infection.

**04:53**
This by the way was the same solution we fell back on before the COVID vaccine was invented during the pandemic.

**04:59**
And prior to the invention of vaccines people had devised all kinds of remedies over the centuries ranging from herbal medicines to bloodletting. Some of these remedies actually did more harm than good and were subsequently replaced with better solutions.

**Case Study 5: Fire and Business Model Design**

**05:15**
So the last one here on the list is fire. And I'm going to slow down on this one and use it to illustrate how we might actually brainstorm and design a business model from scratch. Let’s pretend to go back in time and assume that we have just invented a way to control fire and now want to build a startup around this idea.

**05:35**
What Lean Canvas should we carve on our cave wall? First you have to recognize that fire too is a technology and not enough by itself to answer this question. We need more context, starting with the use case.

**05:49**
So let’s start with what could people use fire to do? Well for one, fire can be used as a heating source to keep us warm. So instead of being cramped up in our cave with layers of fur coats trying to stay warm, we could be sitting around a campfire with other tribe members exchanging stories. That's one Lean Canvas around the core job of staying warm.

**06:10**
Next, animals are also afraid of fire and so we could light up our camp with torches which would keep them out. Fire is also destructive and we could light up arrows and cannonballs similarly and propel them at our enemies to wage wars, which unfortunately we still do to this day with modern weaponry. Both these represent another Lean Canvas around the core job of protection.

**06:33**
And finally, there's the use case that changed our place in the food chain. Before fire we didn't have cooking technology and could only eat raw foods that we could naturally digest. We were gatherers and became hunters once we learned how to cook grains and meat which opened up many more food sources. This is yet another Lean Canvas around the core job of nutrition.

**Crafting Unique Value Propositions**

**06:56**
Notice that each of these business models reveals very different existing alternatives depending on the context or use case. Once you identify the use case and the existing alternative or true competition, crafting a promise of a better or unique value proposition becomes a whole lot easier.

**07:15**
A compelling unique value proposition anchors against the shortcomings of a familiar existing alternative and demonstrates a different and better way of getting the same job done.

**07:26**
For our fire startup, the final step here would be pitting these business models against each other and starting with the most promising unique value proposition that would cause a switch.

**07:37**
If for instance we lived in a warm climate, the "keep yourself warm" value proposition would probably land flat. If we weren't being threatened by predators or waging wars at others, the protection value proposition would also land flat.

**07:51**
I'd argue that everyone at that time was probably searching for more food, so maybe opening up more food sources would be the winner here.

**Addressing the Fallacy of No Competition**

**08:00**
I say maybe because whenever we introduce a new way of doing something, it will be met with some resistance. And as compelling as the story might sound to us, it still needs to be tested with customers and the market.

**08:13**
Another common thread you'll see here in all these examples is that the true competition looks nothing like the new solution. It doesn't even belong in the same category. This is often why startup founders think or believe they have no competition.

**08:27**
They think that they are operating in a brand new market or category and use terms like direct and indirect competition. Hopefully I've convinced you that thinking you have no competition is a fallacy.

**08:39**
Labeling your competition as direct or indirect or labeling your solution as category defining is also irrelevant because at the end of the day you still have to cause a switch from whatever your customers are currently using to start using your product.

**The Paradox of Innovative Solutions**

**08:55**
It's tempting to think that a more unique and category defining innovative solution would make the switch easier but ironically the opposite is true. Most first movers of innovative solutions have historically failed to convince enough customers to switch before they have run out of resources.

**09:13**
Take a look at this list of companies: Microsoft, Ford, Google, Facebook, Apple, Toyota. None of these companies were first movers to market with the products that made them household names. They were all fast followers.

**09:23**
I'd go even so far to say that being truly first to market with a highly innovative product can be an unfair disadvantage versus an unfair advantage. This is because people are creatures of habit and their first instinct is to resist change.

**09:37**
This is the principle of inertia from physics which applies equally to people just as it does to physical objects. This gets even more challenging because entrepreneurs typically live in the future and often over-index on their solutions, which causes them to enter markets too early.

**Conclusion: The Importance of Timing**

**09:54**
First movers have to simultaneously build a new and innovative better solution and also convince early adopters to overcome their inertia and switch, which can be quite hard to do. This is why the timing of an idea has been attributed as one of the top contributors to a startup’s success.

**10:12**
The same idea can fail one year and be successful two or three years later. But timing an idea feels a lot like luck. How do you deliberately time or test the timing of an idea? I cover that in this video which you should check out next. Thanks for watching and until next time, take care.

**Notes organized with timestamps**

**Key Theory: Invention vs. Innovation**
*   **01:12** - Invention represents new technologies in the solution context.
*   **01:23** - Innovation is the application of these inventions to solve existing problems currently addressed by alternatives.
*   **01:42** - To find true competition, ask what the job is and what popular solution is currently used to do it.

**The Five Historical Examples**
*   **02:02** - **Automobile:** The job was transportation; the competition was walking or horse-drawn carriages.
*   **02:54** - **The Wheel:** Initially used for pottery (competition was hand-making); transportation use came much later.
*   **03:47** - **Space Travel:** The job is exploration; competition includes terrestrial navigation and telescopic observation.
*   **04:39** - **Vaccines:** The job is preventing disease; competition was social distancing and herbal remedies.
*   **05:15** - **Fire:** Can be viewed through different contexts (heating, protection, nutrition). Each context yields different competition.

**Strategies for Success**
*   **07:09** - A Unique Value Proposition (UVP) is easier to craft once the specific use case and true competition are known.
*   **08:13** - True competition often belongs to a completely different category than the new solution.
*   **08:35** - Believing you have "no competition" is a fallacy; you must always overcome customer inertia.
*   **08:55** - The first mover disadvantage: Highly innovative solutions face more resistance; being first can be a disadvantage.
*   **09:20** - Most industry giants (Google, Facebook, etc.) were "fast followers" rather than first movers.
*   **10:05** - Timing is the #1 contributor to startup success. Same ideas can fail or succeed based solely on the year of entry.
