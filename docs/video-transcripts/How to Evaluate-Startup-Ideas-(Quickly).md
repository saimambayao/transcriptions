**How to Evaluate a Startup Idea in Under 5 Minutes**

**Introduction: The Cost of Startup Ideas**

**00:00**
Startup ideas can easily consume years of your life. This is time you’re never going to get back, which is why you need to ensure that your idea is worth pursuing before investing lots of time, money, or effort into it. In this video, I’m going to show you how to use a simple five-minute test you can use to check the viability of any idea.

**00:18**
Hi there, if you’re new to this channel, my name is Ash Maurya. I’m an entrepreneur and author and the creator of the one-page business modeling tool, Lean Canvas. On this channel, I share systematic strategies for starting and growing a business.

**00:30**
Let me start by sharing what we are not going to do. We are not going to build a fictional hockey-stick forecast using an Excel-magic spreadsheet. The problem with using these spreadsheets is that they are built on too many unknowable numbers that quietly mask your riskiest assumptions in layers of innocent lies that compound on each other.

**00:50**
We’re also not going to rely on a top-down sizing model. This is where you try and justify an idea simply by attaching it to a large enough market. The logic goes that if you can capture just 1% of this market, you’ll be all set. After all, 1% of a billion-dollar market is still a lot of zeros.

**01:08**
The problem with this approach is that it doesn’t address how you’re going to get to that 1% market share with your given product. What we are going to do instead is build a bottom-up model using a simple back-of-the-envelope estimation technique devised by physicist Enrico Fermi.

**Enrico Fermi and the Power of Order-of-Magnitude Estimation**

**01:24**
Enrico Fermi was an Italian physicist famous for making rapid order-of-magnitude estimations with seemingly little data. He worked on the Manhattan Project developing the atomic bomb, and if you’ve seen the Oscar-winning movie *Oppenheimer*, he’s featured in it.

**01:39**
He’s the one taking bets from his fellow physicists when the bomb is tested at the Trinity site to see whose estimate of the blast power comes closest. Yes, of course he wins, but he does this by dropping a few pieces of paper during the blast and measuring the distance they traveled as they fell to the ground.

**01:56**
Now even if you’ve never heard of Fermi estimation, if you’ve ever played this game of guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar, this is a Fermi problem. As emptying the jar is not an option, a better approach would be to estimate the jar’s height and radius and then doing some volume calculations in your head to arrive at a number.

**Applying Fermi Estimation to Your Business Model**

**02:14**
To make this video more practical, let’s pretend I have a $100 product targeted at SaaS companies. I already have 30 customers ready to pay now and dozens more in the pipeline. I think I can get hundreds of customers over the next six months and then raise a seed round. Is this business model worth pursuing?

**02:31**
This might look like a promising idea with early traction, but let’s work through the numbers using Fermi estimation:
1. Goal Sizing
2. Customer Sizing
3. Market Sizing

**Step 1: Goal Sizing and the Minimum Success Criteria**

**02:39**
The first step to stress-testing viability is estimating your idea’s ballpark goal. This quote sums up why: "If you don't know where you are going, any road will get you there." In other words, you need to draw a line in the sand with a goal before you can test the viability of your idea.

**02:55**
Now the mistake a lot of people make with goal setting is trying to estimate their idea’s maximum upside potential. Getting to an exit or an IPO often takes at least five to seven years, making it a hard, if not impossible, milestone to estimate because it is too far out in the future.

**03:12**
All startup ideas are enveloped in a thick fog of uncertainty in the early stages. This is precisely why instead of estimating your idea’s maximum upside potential, I recommend estimating your idea’s Minimum Success Criteria.

**03:26**
The Minimum Success Criteria is the smallest outcome that would deem your project a success three years from now. Why three years?
1. First, because three years is a lot easier to visualize than five years.
2. Second, three years is roughly how long it takes an average product to get past the "Valley of Death" and hit product-market fit.

**03:48**
And finally, three years still represents a significant enough time investment, and so if you were going to invest three years of your life on any idea, what would be the smallest outcome that would make it worthwhile?

**Defining Revenue Tiers**

**03:59**
Now you don’t need to overthink this step. It helps to measure outcomes as annual revenue and limit the choices to Fermi-style order-of-magnitude values. When we do that, the possible choices shrink to only four possible outcomes:
*   Level 1: $100k ARR (quit your day job)
*   Level 2: $1M ARR (small company)
*   Level 3: $10M ARR (VC backable business)
*   Level 4: $100M ARR (Unicorn)

**04:20**
There is no right or wrong answer here, but you should have an answer because as you’ll see shortly, this is one of the critical inputs that's going to shape your idea. For our example idea, since we intend on raising seed funding, this puts us at a Level 3 Minimum Success Criteria.

**Step 2: Customer Sizing (ARPA)**

**04:36**
The next step is customer sizing. Here we estimate ARPA, or how much revenue you expect to make per customer in a given year. To do that, yes you need some ballpark pricing for your product, and while you may not have sorted out exact pricing, you should still be able to come up with a Fermi estimate.

**04:54**
Do you expect your customers to pay you 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, or 100,000 dollars per year? In my example, I already had a pricing model of $100 a month. That’s equivalent to $1,200 over the year, which is still closer to $1,000 than $10,000, so that’s what we’ll use at this step.

**Step 3: Market Sizing and the 1% Rule**

**05:13**
The final step is market sizing. This is where we test whether your target market is big enough to support your goal. For my idea, as you can see from this visual, in order to build a $10 million ARR business at $100 a month, I would need 10,000 customers.

**05:28**
But we need leads to create customers, and no funnel converts at 100%, and so the last input we need to estimate is the conversion rate from leads to customers. If we stick with Fermi values, the only realistic option is 1%.

**05:42**
While this number may seem low to you, a 1% conversion rate is fairly accurate for a $100 SaaS product. In fact, according to data from Salesforce, a 1% conversion rate is also fairly accurate to use for a B2B, B2C, or e-commerce product at scale.

**The Reality Check**

**05:58**
This means that in order to get one customer, I will need 100 leads. So in order to get 10,000 customers, I will need 1,000,000 leads. Is this realistic? A quick Google search reveals that there are only 30,000 active SaaS companies in the world today.

**06:12**
We’re off by two orders of magnitude here, and so even if you were wondering whether using a 3, 5, or 10% conversion rate would have made a difference, it wouldn’t have. This idea is a non-starter given my goal.

**How to Fix the Model**

**06:24**
It would be quite depressing to end the video here, so let’s see what we can do to fix the model. Because a Fermi estimate uses order-of-magnitude estimations, when a model breaks like it just did, the way you fix it is by searching for one or more 10x levers.

**06:41**
Here are some possible ways to do that:
1. **Raise pricing.** This is one of the most underutilized growth levers. Could we 10x pricing and charge $1,000 instead of $100 a month? What would we need to do to the product to justify this 10x pricing?
2. **Target a bigger problem.** If step one doesn't get us there, could we target a bigger problem that is worth $1,000 or $10,000 to a SaaS company?

**07:00**
3. **Find a higher value customer segment.** While there were only 30,000 active SaaS companies, there are millions of e-commerce and SMB companies out there.
4. **Combine levers.** If you can’t find a single 10x growth lever to pull, you can often find a combination of two 3x levers to get you there.

**Conclusion: Moving Forward with Traction Roadmaps**

**07:18**
Even though Fermi estimates are rough estimates, they're highly effective at quickly invalidating non-starter ideas as we just saw. And because they're built on just a handful of inputs, when a model doesn't work, you often know why and also how to fix it.

**07:32**
Now once you have a business model that passes the viability test, the next step is turning it into a traction roadmap, which charts your three-year Minimum Success Criteria on a timeline that you can use to start validating your idea. I'll link some resources for that down in the description below.

### **Organized Notes: Evaluating Startup Ideas**

**I. The Core Problem (00:00 - 00:30)**
*   **Time is the Scarcest Resource:** Acting on ideas is expensive because it consumes years of life that cannot be recovered.
*   **The Goal:** Test viability in under 5 minutes before investing significant money or effort.

**II. What Not to Do (00:30 - 01:24)**
*   **Avoid "Excel-Magic":** Spreadsheets with 5-year forecasts are often "layers of innocent lies" that hide risks.
*   **Avoid Top-Down Sizing:** Claiming "1% of a billion-dollar market" is meaningless without a plan to actually capture those customers.
*   **The Alternative:** Bottom-up modeling using Fermi Estimation.

**III. Understanding Fermi Estimation (01:24 - 02:14)**
*   **Concept:** Named after Enrico Fermi, it focuses on order-of-magnitude (powers of 10) calculations with limited data.
*   **Historical Context:** Fermi used pieces of paper to estimate the blast power of the atomic bomb during the Manhattan Project.
*   **Analogy:** It is like estimating jelly beans in a jar using volume math rather than counting them one by one.

**IV. Step 1: Goal Sizing (Minimum Success Criteria) (02:39 - 04:36)**
*   **MSC Definition:** The smallest outcome that makes the project a success 3 years from now.
*   **Why 3 Years?** 
    *   Easier to visualize than 5+ years.
    *   Timeline for hitting product-market fit.
*   **Revenue Levels (ARR):**
    *   **Level 1 ($100k):** Lifestyle business/self-employment.
    *   **Level 2 ($1M):** Small company.
    *   **Level 3 ($10M):** Venture-backable business.
    *   **Level 4 ($100M+):** Unicorn status.

**V. Step 2: Customer Sizing (ARPA) (04:36 - 05:13)**
*   **ARPA:** Annual Revenue Per Average customer.
*   **Pricing Estimates:** Use Fermi values ($10, $100, $1k, $10k, $100k) to determine what customers would realistically pay.

**VI. Step 3: Market Sizing & The 1% Rule (05:13 - 06:24)**
*   **The Math:** Determine how many customers are needed to hit the Level 3/Level 4 goal based on ARPA.
*   **Conversion Reality:** Funnels rarely convert at high rates. A 1% lead-to-paid conversion rate is a standard, realistic benchmark for SaaS and e-commerce.
*   **The Gap Analysis:** Calculate the total leads needed vs. the actual available market size. If you need 1,000,000 leads but only 30,000 potential customers exist, the model is unviable.

**VII. Fixing a Broken Model (06:24 - 07:18)**
*   **Search for 10x Levers:**
    *   **Raise Price:** Increase ARPA to reduce the number of customers needed.
    *   **Solve a Bigger Problem:** Move upmarket where companies pay significantly more.
    *   **Pivot Segments:** Switch from a niche market (30k companies) to a broader market (millions of SMBs).
    *   **Compound Levers:** Combine two 3x improvements to achieve a 10x effect.

**VIII. Next Steps (07:18 - 07:58)**
*   **Traction Roadmap:** Once an idea passes the Fermi test, create 90-day milestones to track progress toward the 3-year MSC.
