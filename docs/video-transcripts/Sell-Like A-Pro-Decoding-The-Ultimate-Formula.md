**The Physics of Doing Business: The 4 Customer Forces**

**00:00**
What if I told you there's physics involved in doing business? Just like gravity has laws, business has laws too. There are four invisible forces that govern customer psychology and can 10x your sales.

**00:12**
These forces are like the physics of customer behavior. Once you understand them, you can predict what customers will buy before they even know it themselves.

**00:21**
Meet Steve, a founder of a virtual reality platform that helps architects turn their 2D sketches into rich immersive walkthroughs for their clients. He used this framework and his sales accuracy jumped from 10% to 89%.

**00:35**
In this video, I'll show you exactly how to use these forces to design offers customers cannot refuse.

**The Pitfall of One-Dimensional Selling**

**00:42**
And so a few years ago, I'm pitching my product to a potential customer. They say they love our product, say it's exactly what they need, and we're both excited. Three weeks later, I get an email from them: "Thanks, but we've decided to stick with our current process."

**00:57**
This happened to me 17 times before I realized I was missing something fundamental. I was focused on wielding just one force—Pull—during my demos, but I learned that there are three other forces that I wasn't using and leveraging.

**01:11**
Our virtual reality founder friend, Steve, from past videos, also had the same blindness. His VR demos were incredible, everyone was wowed by them, but no one was buying.

**01:23**
Like me, he usually got the polite "no" treatment—something along the lines of "We need to think about it" or "The timing isn't just right." It's easy to throw up our arms in the air when this happens and dismiss this as just the way it is, but then that's when it hit me.

**The Physics of Customer Decisions**

**01:38**
Customer decisions aren't rational or irrational. They are driven by basic laws of physics. Just like Newton's laws of motion, customers too are subject to forces.

**01:49**
And until the forces pushing them away from their current solution exceed the forces pulling them back, they won't move, no matter how good you think your product is.

**Force #1: Push**

**01:59**
Here's exactly how the customer forces work. The first force that kicks everything else off is Push. This force is triggered by an external event often caused by:
* Frustration with the status quo
* A pain that is getting worse
* Problems that start costing time and money
* Some external pressure to change like regulatory changes for instance.

**02:24**
Most founders never take the time to really understand this force of Push, which is the underlying motivation for change.

**Force #2: Pull**

**02:31**
They instead focus only on the number two force—Pull—where they try to:
* Attract the prospect towards their new capabilities
* Promise them better outcomes through emotional appeal and rational benefits.

**02:44**
But unless the prospect is already primed for change, they will often downplay or completely ignore these benefits in their mind because the other two forces—Inertia and Friction—play an even bigger role.

**Force #3: Inertia**

**02:56**
Force number three is Inertia, and this represents our resistance to change. Newton's first law of motion: all objects at rest prefer to stay at rest.

**03:07**
These are the stories playing out in the prospect's mind:
* We've always done it this way
* Our current solution isn't all that bad
* Change is hard
* Good enough is good enough.

**Force #4: Friction**

**03:19**
And the other detracting force that keeps them from buying is force number four: Friction. This is the fear or anxiety of trying something new.

**03:28**
Things like:
* What if it doesn't work?
* What if we waste time and money?
* What if it's harder than promised?
* What if we look stupid at the end?

**03:36**
These are the stories that keep people from using a new solution and keep them stuck on their, in their mind, safer current solution.

**The Buying Formula and Loss Aversion**

**03:46**
A purchase decision then comes down to basic physics. A prospect will buy if: (Push + Pull) > (Inertia + Friction).

**03:53**
Now unfortunately, it's a little bit worse than this because of the principle of loss aversion. Humans don't typically behave like rational objects.

**04:03**
The principle of loss aversion is the behavioral economics principle pioneered by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, where they found that people tend to feel losses (or negative forces) more intensely, sometimes 2-3 times more intensely, than equivalent gains (or positive forces).

**04:19**
What this means for us is that prospects will tend to exaggerate their Inertia and Friction, or fear of trying something new, and downplay your claims when making a decision.

**04:30**
This is precisely why just focusing on the Pull or benefits of your product isn't enough; your pitch needs to work on all four forces.

**Case Study: Steve’s 89% Close Rate**

**04:38**
So let's go back to Steve. Once he understood these forces, he completely redesigned his entire sales pitch. Before, he was solely focused on Pull selling. He led with an amazing demo, emphasized cool technology, focused on features and benefits, and had a 10% close rate.

**04:56**
After, he reworked his pitch to tackle all four forces. And he started with Push to trigger the motivation to change. In his case, he teased the promised land by showcasing how other architects were already using a new way—Virtual Reality—in their client discovery calls to close more deals faster. This created instant FOMO in the minds of his prospects.

**05:19**
He then amplified their pain to mitigate their Inertia or resistance to change by describing how their current solution was incapable of competing with this new approach. I call this step "breaking the old way in the mind of the prospect."

**05:35**
This setup created the opening he needed to then contextualize the Pull of his product with an impressive but focused demo that delivered exactly on this promise.

**05:46**
And the final and most fun step was reducing Friction by offering, in his case, a Mafia offer with a risk-free pilot period where he would actually help close their next deal with his solution. Who would say no to that?

**05:59**
Once he started using this new approach, his close rate went from 10% to 89% and most architects bought on the spot. That's what happens when you wield not just one but all four forces in your pitch.

**How to Map Your Customer Forces**

**06:13**
In the next section, I'll walk you through a step-by-step process for mapping your customer forces.

**Step 1: Customer Forces Interviews**

**06:19**
Step number one is the Customer Forces Interview. Now sure, it's possible to take a guess at these forces, but the nature of new products is that at the outset, we often don't know what we don't know.

**06:31**
Unless you're a mind reader, the best and easiest way I find to uncover these forces is through carefully scripted customer forces interviews. You don't need to interview hundreds of prospects to figure this out; somewhere between 10 and 20 is all the information you need to unpack these forces.

**Step 2: Mapping the Forces**

**06:49**
And that gets you to step number two: Mapping the Customer Forces. This is where you segment your customers to identify real and ideal early adopters primed for change and rank the most influential forces to emphasize in your pitch and in your MVP.

**Step 3: Assembling a Mafia Offer**

**07:06**
Then you move into step number three: Assembling a Mafia Offer. You use what you learned, not guessed, to craft a carefully scripted product pitch that hits on all four cylinders or all four forces:
1. It pushes them to act
2. Pulls them towards your solution
3. Overcomes their Inertia
4. And finally closes the deal by eliminating all Friction.

**Step 4: Delivering and Optimizing**

**07:29**
Then the fun begins. Step number four is where you deliver and optimize your Mafia offer. When you switch from a demo-focused pitch to a story-driven pitch, you lead your prospect down a more predictable path where you can measure their reactions along the way.

**07:43**
Set them up to buy or tell you why they're not buying—both of which will help you continually improve and optimize your offer. And like Steve, move from hoping they will buy to knowing that they will.

**Resources and Next Steps**

**07:56**
Now if you want to map your customer forces, you can download the Customer Forces Canvas we use in my Demand Validation course.

**08:03**
I'm also working on a new AI-powered tool that helps automate and greatly speed up many of the steps above. Downloading the canvas will put you on our launch list and you'll be notified when that's ready.

**08:14**

### **Organized Notes**

#### **1. The 4 Customer Forces Concept [00:00 - 00:35]**
*   **Business Physics:** Customer psychology is governed by specific forces similar to the laws of gravity or motion.
*   **Goal:** Use these forces to predict behavior and 10x sales accuracy.
*   **Case Study (Steve):** An architect-focused VR platform increased its sales close rate from 10% to 89% by applying this framework.

#### **2. Personal Insight: Personal Failure [00:42 - 01:11]**
*   **Personal Experience:** Pitched LeanStack to potential customers who initially claimed to "love it" but later stuck with their old processes (failed 17 times).
*   **The Error:** Over-relying on **Pull** (features/benefits) while ignoring the other three forces.

#### **3. The Customer Physics Equation [01:38 - 01:58]**
*   **Newton's Analogy:** Prospects remain in their current state unless external forces overcome their resistance.
*   **The Equation [03:46]:** `(Push + Pull) > (Inertia + Friction)`
*   **Loss Aversion [03:53]:** Negative forces (Inertia/Friction) are felt 2–3 times more intensely than gains. Prospects naturally downplay the product's benefits.

#### **4. Deep Dive into the Forces**
*   **Force #1: Push [01:59 - 02:30]**
    *   **Definition:** The underlying motivation/trigger for change.
    *   **Triggers:** Frustration with status quo, increasing pain, financial/time losses, regulatory changes.
*   **Force #2: Pull [02:31 - 02:55]**
    *   **Definition:** Attractive qualities of the new solution.
    *   **Methods:** New capabilities, emotional appeal, rational benefits.
*   **Force #3: Inertia [02:56 - 03:20]**
    *   **Definition:** Resistance to change/comfort with the status quo.
    *   **Mindset:** "We've always done it this way," "It's good enough."
*   **Force #4: Friction [03:21 - 03:45]**
    *   **Definition:** Fear and anxiety regarding the new solution.
    *   **Anxieties:** "What if it fails?", "What if it's too hard?", "Will I look stupid?".

#### **5. Steve’s Redesigned Pitch Strategy [04:38 - 05:58]**
*   **Initial Approach:** 100% Pull (Tech/Features). Result: 10% close rate.
*   **New Approach:**
    *   **Push:** Showed FOMO (other architects closing deals using VR).
    *   **Inertia:** "Broke the old way" by showing its inability to compete.
    *   **Pull:** Focused demo delivering on the initial promise.
    *   **Friction:** Offered a "Mafia Offer" (risk-free pilot).
*   **Result:** 89% close rate.

#### **6. Implementation Steps [06:13 - 07:55]**
*   **Step 1: Customer Forces Interviews:** 10–20 interviews to uncover the unknown "whys".
*   **Step 2: Mapping:** Segment customers to find early adopters primed for change.
*   **Step 3: Assembling a Mafia Offer:** Script a pitch that addresses all four forces.
*   **Step 4: Delivering and Optimizing:** Measure reactions and improve the story-driven pitch.

#### **7. Available Resources [07:56 - End]**
*   **Customer Forces Canvas:** Available for download via the speaker’s website.
*   **AI Tool:** A forthcoming tool to automate force mapping.
*   **Educational Video:** A recommended follow-up on the skill of customer interviewing.
