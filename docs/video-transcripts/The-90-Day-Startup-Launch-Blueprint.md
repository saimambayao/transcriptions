**Redefining the MVP Strategy**

**00:00**
Most founders think MVP means launching a product with bare minimum features, but that's exactly why 73% of startups fail after launch. What if I told you that the secret to nailing your MVP isn't building the minimum or the maximum, but rather launching with the right cocktail mix of features that causes customers to want to switch to your product?

**00:21**
Today I'll show you the exact framework I use and have taught thousands of founders for building what customers want with the least amount of effort and waste. Let me start by talking about why people grossly misunderstand MVPs.

**00:33**
The first hang-up I find is on the word "minimum." Too many people equate this with a bare "minimum" product. The problem, of course, with bare minimum is that it gets a lukewarm response. Nobody cares that you can do what your competitors already do; they want to know what you can do that's different and new.

**00:51**
The second challenge is that you can't completely ignore what your competitors are already doing, especially if they offer basic features that your customers already expect, like brakes in a car. No one would ever buy a car that doesn't have brakes, or headlights, or wipers, or a dozen other basic features. 

**01:07**
People don't buy a car because of these features, but expect them to be there anyway. Now, for a founder building a new car, these basic features explode the scope of their MVP because you have to build all these things and create something new and different at the same time.

**01:23**
The second hang-up I encounter often is on the word "viable." What does that really mean? Most people view this, of course, as a product customers will pay for, but where they again go astray is thinking that customers will only pay for a complete product that has all the basic features first, and then they try to sprinkle or layer their differentiation on top.

**01:45**
This lands you back in the world of not building an MVP, but rather an MUP: a maximally undifferentiated product. 

**01:51**
This is why I stopped viewing MVPs just from the lens of viability and instead refined the V in MVP to mean "valuable" and not just "viable." A minimum valuable product doesn't just address viability, but also customer desirability and technical feasibility. In other words, you are asking, "Will they want this?" and "Can you build this quickly enough?"

**02:14**
Desirability is all about the unique value proposition or promise of your product that is different and better than the other products that you're competing against. And feasibility is all about your speed of execution. 

**02:26**
Given enough time, money, and effort, we can build almost anything these days, but customers and, more importantly, competitors don't just wait around forever.

**The Kano Model and Feature Archetypes**

**02:35**
So how do you determine the right feature cocktail mix for building minimum valuable products? This is where the Kano model comes in. 

**02:41**
The Kano model was developed in the 1980s by Noriaki Kano, where he plotted features showing how they delivered on customer satisfaction versus how sophisticated or built out they were. 

**02:55**
What he discovered, not surprisingly, is that not all features are created equal. They don't all deliver on the same level of customer satisfaction, and he came up with five different archetypes of features.

**03:07**
Type one are "must-have" or basic features. These are table stakes—expected basic features like brakes on a car that need to be in a product.

**03:16**
Here's how you read this graph:
* Customers don't get super excited or delighted when basic features are present, and you can see how satisfaction flatlines after a certain point.
* But when these features are absent, customers get very dissatisfied.

**03:32**
The next feature type is type two: performance features. Here, more is better. These have a linear relationship with customer satisfaction. Sticking with the car example, a good example here of a performance feature is the horsepower or power of the engine, where most customers equate more with better.

**03:51**
Type three features are delighters. Think of these as unexpected features that create disproportionate customer happiness. Examples of this in the car might be features like GPS, park assist, and self-driving features.

**04:04**
Technically, we don't need any of these to drive a car, but each of them adds a wow factor when they were introduced. 

**04:11**
Now, it's worth noting that true delighters aren't just gimmicks that attempt to put lipstick on a pig, but rather they solve a real, existing problem in a new and different way. 

**04:27**
Over time, these delighters—if they are the right kind of delighters—eventually transition from being delighters that are only available in early products to becoming must-haves that become mainstream. 

**04:34**
You can see this also play out in cars with things like rearview cameras for park assist. They were delighters when they first came out, but became mandatory here in the US for vehicles weighing under 10,000 pounds after 2018.

**04:48**
Okay, so moving on. Type four is the zone of indifference. These are lukewarm features that just don't move the needle either way. You obviously want to avoid these features at all costs because you end up building features or something that nobody really wants.

**05:02**
And finally, type five are reverse features, which are essentially the inverse of the performance features that we talked about early on. Here, more is actually worse on customer satisfaction. In the car world, think of car emissions. More car emissions is actually worse than being better, and so that's what makes that a reverse feature.

**The 4-Step MVP Cocktail Framework**

**05:21**
So looking at this list, it should hopefully be readily obvious that a good minimum valuable product needs to avoid the zone of indifference, because nobody cares about them, and reverse features. 

**05:32**
And instead strive to prioritize their feature cocktail in this order: delighters first, then performance, and finally must-haves. 

**05:40**
The problem, of course, is that true delighters require innovation, which isn't easy, so you can't invest in too many of these. And the must-have features, as we saw earlier, can drain your resources because you need them, but they by themselves aren't enough to cause a switch. 

**05:55**
So how do you balance the right mix of features? This is where the four-step MVP cocktail comes in. I'll show you exactly how Tesla nailed their MVP using this framework.

**06:07**
Step one: build your unique value proposition around just one delighter feature to start. The bad news, of course, with delighters is that they are hard to build, but the good news is that you only need one primary delighter that you can highlight in your promise or unique value proposition.

**06:23**
For Tesla, when building electric cars back in 2006, this delighter came from sustainability. All cars at the time had some level of emissions, which, as we saw earlier, is a reverse feature. 

**06:35**
Tesla didn't just promise lower emissions; they wanted to eliminate emissions by promising zero emissions. This positioning wasn't just about being better than other cars; it was about being categorically different. 

**06:47**
Everyone else was trying to claim that their car has the best gas mileage, while Tesla was claiming our car has zero emissions. That's a delighter: a completely new benefit category that customers still care about.

**07:01**
Step number two: don't forget about meeting minimum performance metrics. Now, technically, Tesla did not invent electric cars or build the first electric car. What they did do is make electric cars mainstream by ensuring their 100% electric cars could meet certain minimum performance standards. 

**07:19**
In their case, this was the range of the car. 

**07:22**
While there were many concept electric cars that came and went before them, most of them were just souped-up golf carts. The reason they never got serious attention is that they could only go a short distance, like 30 miles or 50 kilometers, on a single charge. 

**07:35**
In order for it to be taken seriously to cause a switch from a combustion-powered vehicle, Tesla determined that they needed to have their cars go at least 200 miles, and that was the minimum performance metric they had to deliver on to be taken seriously. 

**07:51**
So their internal mandate in the company became delivering an all-electric zero-emissions car that could go at least 200 miles on a single charge. Hopefully you can see how delivering on this creates a value proposition that is unique, different, and usable by customers at the same time.

**08:08**
Now stopping here can be enough for most products, but Tesla went a step further. 

**08:13**
Step three: layering in an additional axis of better. You've probably seen the classic 2x2 differentiation matrix where we try to show how our product is in the top right corner in a category of its own making compared to existing alternatives. 

**08:27**
That is what step three is all about. Being good on just one dimension of good is good, but two is even better. 

**08:35**
Once Tesla nailed the delighter and minimum performance steps, they added a second delighter feature: acceleration, which for them was a nice side effect of going all-electric. 

**08:45**
Because their cars didn't have a multi-gear transmission, they could deliver instant maximum torque, making them go from 0 to 60 very, very quickly. 

**08:54**
Now they didn't just bury this fact in a feature list, but rather made it their second axis of better by building an electric sports car and claiming that they were building the fastest and greenest car money can buy. To make sure people got the message, they even arranged many publicity stunts where they raced the Tesla Roadster against other popular supercars.

**09:15**
So this is how they prioritized their MVP to deliver on a compelling and different UVP, but we still have a problem. A car isn't just a battery and an electric motor; it has a hundred other basic features that people expect, all of which take time, money, and effort to build. 

**09:31**
A typical car takes 10 years to go from concept to road-ready, but Tesla managed to do this in just two and a half years. How do they pull that off? This is where some out-of-the-box thinking from step four comes in.

**09:44**
Step number four: innovate around basic features. Tesla's genius move wasn't trying to build their first car from scratch, but instead licensing a pre-built Lotus Motors chassis and plugging their battery into it. 

**09:58**
They essentially cobbled together their car by using an existing car which was already road-ready, using what we now call the Wizard of Oz MVP design pattern. 

**10:08**
This allowed them to focus 100% of their innovation resources on one thing: battery technology. 

**The VR Platform Case Study**

**10:14**
Now let me show you exactly how Steve, our virtual reality founder, applied this. 

**10:19**
His delighter feature came from turning a 2D architectural sketch into a 3D immersive virtual reality experience in minutes, not days, just by taking a few pictures on a mobile phone. You can imagine the look on his architect prospects' faces when he turned one of their architectural sketches into a VR walkthrough right in the pitch meeting itself.

**10:40**
Now every other VR platform required tons of training, and this is where Steve made it work in just 30 seconds. That's not just better; that's very, very different. 

**10:50**
His minimum performance metric was realizing that his models didn't need to be perfect down to the nearest inch. Just like he used his delighter to close architects, his promise to them was for them to close their homeowner clients on their first meetings, too. This was the killer unique value proposition that got his product adopted.

**11:10**
Unlike Tesla, now he couldn't immediately think of a second axis of better, but stumbled into one just a few weeks of doing demos when one of the architects asked him if he could create a walkthrough with specific furniture and appliances they had already built into their plan. 

**11:27**
This led him to build a reusable catalog of components that not only led to even more personalized experiences for clients, but turned into his moat or unfair advantage over time against competitors.

**11:39**
Before taking this MVP cocktail approach, Steve was drowning in a list of must-have features he thought he needed to build in order to close the deal. 

**11:47**
But after repositioning his product as a sales tool versus 3D modeling, he was able to reduce his scope and gained instant differentiation. To make his product a no-brainer, he also implemented step four where he innovated around basic features. 

**12:01**
While his architect customers loved the idea of using his solution to win clients, they still needed to, at the end of the meeting, turn their concepts into 3D models and needed more advanced CAD or modeling features to do that. 

**12:15**
Instead of Steve building these features himself, he turned to these existing off-the-shelf products that architects were already using and built export and plug-in features that allowed them to quickly bring in their client-approved VR models into their software platform and then refine further from there. 

**12:31**
This not only allowed him to move fast on the one thing he needed to move fast on, but also turned several direct competitors into channel partners.

**Demand Validation and the 90-Day System**

**12:00** (Segment Reset)
In just 90 days, I can help you validate your startup idea without having to first build or finish a working product. I have helped over a thousand founders do exactly that using a simple, proven framework. And today I'm revealing the complete 90-day validation system that makes it possible.

**12:17**
Now here's the truth: most founders waste 6, 12, even 18 months building something nobody wants. But it doesn't have to be this way. You can prove demand before you build and start turning ideas into paying customers really fast. 

**12:31**
A typical founder in one of our coaching programs uses this framework to secure $5,000 to $10,000 of monthly recurring revenue before building anything. 

**12:41**
Tesla got $50,000 deposits before building their first Roadster. Dropbox used a demo video to attract over a hundred thousand users before launching their product. And even a company like Apple, who is no longer a startup anymore by any measure, still uses pre-orders from demos to validate demand before investing millions in manufacturing.

**12:53**
What I'm going to show you today is the exact 90-day validation framework that turns any startup idea into a demand-validated product before you over-invest. I'll walk you through the complete framework, and at the end, I'll show you how to get the guided implementation through our Business Model Design Challenge where I personally walk founders through this process.

**13:12**
Now let me start by telling you about Steve's near disaster that this 90-day framework prevented. Steve had a grand virtual reality platform idea. He spent weeks writing a business plan which didn't get funded. He had mapped out 18 months of product development and set out to building it out on his own. 

**13:31**
That's when Mary introduced him to the systematic validation framework, and instead of building for 18 months and hoping, she had him prove demand in just 90 days using the exact framework we're about to get into.

**13:56**
Using this framework, Steve got 12 out of 15 architects committed to paying $5,000 a month before he wrote a single line of code. That's an 80% conversion rate. This framework helped him sidestep the traditional validation trap. 

**The Failure of Traditional "Build-First" Models**

**14:00**
Here's why traditional "build-first" validation fails:

**14:13**
Problem number one: you're validating the wrong thing. You build features and ask your customers "Do you like this?", but most customers don't yet know what they want, or more specifically what they need to solve their problems. And it's easy to mistake their response for validation.

**14:36**
Problem number two: building biases your validation. Once you've invested months building something, you're psychologically committed. You'll interpret weak signals as strong validation because you can't afford to be wrong.

**14:50**
Problem number three: time kills startups. When the time for an idea comes, there are often a dozen other founders in different parts of the world working on the exact same idea. The longer you take to validate:
* The more runway you burn.
* The more pressure builds.
* And the less objective you become about real market signals.

**Phases of the 90-Day Framework**

**15:13**
The 90-day validation framework flips this completely. You validate demand for your product before building anything, making decisions based on customer behavior, not just your assumptions. Here is exactly how the 90-day framework works. I've broken it down into three phases, four weeks each.

**15:21**
Phase 1 is all about problem discovery. That's your first four weeks. 

**15:36**
In week 1, you're researching customer forces. What I mean by that is you're studying what your customers are actually using today, not what they say they want, but their actual current behavior. This is crucial because behavior reveals truth; opinions do not.

**15:52**
In week 2, you run systematic customer interviews, aiming for 10 to 15 of them. And here's the key: in these interviews, you use behavioral questions. Instead of asking "What's your biggest problem?", you ask "Walk me through your last experience with your current solution." You want them describing actions, not giving opinions.

**16:13**
By week 3, you're mapping these insights into customer problem forces. You're looking at what pushes customers away from existing solutions and what would potentially pull them towards new alternatives like yours. Where are those moments of highest frustration? That's where you're going to find the opportunity to go after.

**16:33**
Week 4 is where you validate that this problem is indeed real. You need to at least get 30% of your interviewees showing high problem intensity—people who are actively frustrated and looking for solutions or living with inefficient workarounds. This is how you systematically identify your primary early adopter segment. If you don't hit that threshold, the problem just isn't painful enough at this point to necessarily build a business around.

**17:02**
In Phase 2, we shift towards solution design. Those are weeks 5 through 8. 

**17:07**
In week 5, you develop your solution framework. And this is where most people go astray: you're not designing features; you're designing outcomes. You're in other words looking for the transformation you want to create in your customers with your solution.

**17:22**
In week 6, you test your value proposition with the same people that you interviewed earlier. Does your proposed outcome actually resonate with the problem they experienced? This is where you find out if you really understood their pain points.

**17:36**
Week 7 is about demo creation. Build the minimum demo needed to communicate your solution. This could be mock-ups, wireframes, a video demo—whatever shows the outcome most clearly and succinctly without overbuilding. Remember that you're not building the product at this stage, just demonstrating the concept. If you can't get people to be interested by the concept, you're not going to have any different outcome much later once the product is actually built.

**18:04**
Week 8 is where you validate the solution with fresh prospects. You show your demo and measure their engagement. Remember, we are measuring actions, not just words.
* Are they asking excited questions?
* Are they leaning in when you show them your demo?
* Are they asking you about pricing and release dates? 
Remember, you need at least 30% of the population at this point showing strong interest to validate for problem-solution fit.

**18:30**
In Phase 3, offer delivery. This is your final four weeks. 

**18:34**
In week 9, you design your complete offer. This isn't just your solution; it's how you package it with clear pricing and a delivery timeline. When done well, you end up creating what I call a Mafia Offer, which is an irresistible offer your customers cannot refuse because you nail their problem exactly.

**18:54**
Week 10 is where you test this offer with qualified early adopters. And this is where the rubber actually hits the road. This is where you ask for meaningful commitment—not hypothetical interest, but actual money, time commitment, or other resources that are proxy for money.

**19:12**
Week 11 is optimizing your offer. You're starting to now get real commitments from real customers. Not "I would buy this," but rather "Take my money now." There's a huge difference, of course, between those two statements. This is now where you further lean into your early adopter segmentation and continually optimize your offer for maximum conversion.

**19:33**
Finally in week 12, you analyze your demand validation. By the end of this whole process, it is not atypical to end up with an 80% or higher commitment rate from your qualified early adopters.

**The Benefits of Pre-Build Validation**

**19:46**
At this point, you've proven demand and it's time to start planning and building out your MVP. The beauty of this process is that you know exactly what to build. Your customers bought your demo and that's your product design spec. Each phase builds on each other and validates the next one:
* Problem discovery validates into solution design.
* Solution design validates into offer delivery.
* Offer delivery into demand validation.

**Steve's Final Result**

**20:00**
Let's now go back to Steve. Here's exactly how his 90-day validation worked using this framework. 

**20:07**
In Phase 1, Steve interviewed 15 architects around their current 3D rendering process. He discovered the real problem wasn't rendering quality; it was revision speed and time delays during client decision-making. The key insight here was that these slow revision cycles were killing project profitability.

**20:28**
So in Phase 2, he designed a solution to this problem. Instead of positioning his product as a better 3D render tool, Steve decided to position his product around instant revisions even an architect could do during client meetings. He created mock-ups showing how architects could make real-time changes and win clients. 

**20:47**
He then reached out to a few friendly architects and demoed his concept. When they started asking him about pricing and release dates, he knew he was onto something. 

**20:57**
In Phase 3, then Steve offered his virtual reality platform with instant revisions at $5,000 a month with a 3-month pilot commitment. He presented it to 15 qualified prospects from earlier who had shown strong problem intensity. 

**21:14**
He got 12 of them to commit to start a paid pilot, which translates to an 80% validation rate. Now, before this process, Steve was trying to sell his platform to software developers at $50 a month, but simply by refocusing the same technology to a completely different market, Steve went from targeting $50 a month software developers to $5,000 a month architects. 

**21:40**
And the best part, of course, is that Steve had paying customers lined up before finishing his product. Now if you do the math, he managed to secure $180,000 in customer revenues for a 90-day pilot. He was crystal clear at this point and exactly what to build next, and used this revenue to bring on additional help to speed through his MVP build and start those paid pilots over the next six weeks.

**Applying the Methodology**

**21:58**
So that's the 90-day validation framework and here's why it's so powerful:
1. It's based on behavior, not opinions.
2. It validates incrementally.
3. It uses real market signals.
4. It prevents expensive mistakes.

**22:15**
All of this isn't just theory. It's the exact methodology I've used with over a thousand startups and documented after years of testing and refinement. It's prevented millions in wasted startup resources. 

**22:23**
There's a critical difference between understanding a framework and successfully implementing it. That's why I've created a systematic journey that takes you from idea to paying customers. It starts with a Business Model Design Challenge, which is a foundational program where you first master the seven stress tests that bulletproof any business model. 

**22:42**
Think of it this way: you wouldn't start building a skyscraper without architectural blueprints, and the BMD challenge creates those blueprints for your specific idea and business model.

**22:55**
Then with roadmap in hand, you're ready for the Demand Validation Playbook. Phase 1 includes problem discovery with proven interview scripts; Phase 2 is solution design with demo frameworks; and Phase 3 is offer delivery with Mafia Offer conversion templates.

**23:14**
The Business Model Design Challenge is where we start every founder, and new cohorts begin every Monday. We limit each cohort to ensure everyone gets proper implementation support. Click the description below to secure your spot in the next BMD Challenge. Until next time, take care.

### **Notes**

**I. The Core Philosophy of MVP (Minimally Valuable Product)**
*   **[00:00] Avoid the "Bare Minimum" Trap:** Most founders launch with a "bare minimum" product that lacks differentiation. 73% fail because they build what is *possible* rather than what makes a customer *switch*.
*   **[01:51] Refined Definition:** The "V" in MVP should stand for **Valuable**, not just Viable.
    *   **Viability:** Can we get paid?
    *   **Desirability:** Do they want it?
    *   **Feasibility:** Can we build it fast enough?

**II. The Kano Model: Categorizing Features**
*   **[03:07] Type 1: Must-Haves (Table Stakes):** Expected features (e.g., brakes on a car). Absence causes extreme dissatisfaction, but presence doesn't increase delight.
*   **[03:32] Type 2: Performance Features:** "More is better" (e.g., engine horsepower). Linear relationship with satisfaction.
*   **[03:51] Type 3: Delighters:** Unexpected "wow" factors (e.g., Tesla’s zero emissions). Create disproportionate happiness.
*   **[04:48] Type 4: Indifference:** Lukewarm features that don't impact satisfaction.
*   **[05:02] Type 5: Reverse Features:** "More is worse" (e.g., high car emissions).
*   **[05:32] Priority Order:** Focus on **Delighters** first to create a unique value proposition (UVP), then Performance, then Must-Haves.

**III. The 90-Day Validation Framework (3 Phases)**
*   **Phase 1: Problem Discovery (Weeks 1-4)**
    *   **Week 1:** Research customer behavior (not opinions).
    *   **Week 2:** Conduct behavioral interviews ("Walk me through your last experience...").
    *   **Week 3:** Map problem forces (frustrations with current solutions).
    *   **Week 4:** Validate problem intensity (Need 30%+ showing high intensity).
*   **Phase 2: Solution Design (Weeks 5-8)**
    *   **Week 5:** Design **outcomes**, not just features.
    *   **Week 6:** Test the value proposition with initial interviewees.
    *   **Week 7:** Create a minimal demo (Wizard of Oz pattern—cobble together existing parts).
    *   **Week 8:** Validate demo engagement with fresh prospects.
*   **Phase 3: Offer Delivery (Weeks 9-12)**
    *   **Week 9:** Create a "Mafia Offer" (irresistible terms).
    *   **Week 10:** Test with qualified adopters for **meaningful commitment** (money/time).
    *   **Week 11:** Optimize based on conversion data.
    *   **Week 12:** Analyze final validation rates.

**IV. Real-World Case Studies**
*   **Tesla [06:23]:** Focused on one delighter (Zero Emissions) and one minimum performance metric (200-mile range). They used an existing car chassis (Lotus) to innovate *only* on battery tech, cutting build time from 10 years to 2.5 years.
*   **Steve (VR Platform) [10:19]:** Switched from targeting developers ($50/mo) to architects ($5,000/mo) by solving a specific revision speed problem. He validated $180,000 in revenue before his MVP was finished.

**V. Actionable Next Steps**
*   **[22:23] Blueprints before Building:** Master business model stress tests before building.
*   **[23:14] Cohorts:** New cohorts for the Business Model Design Challenge start every Monday.
