**Lean Principles in Practice**

**00:00**
Lean principles can be a lot like common sense: easy to understand but hard to practice.

**The Origin Story: Lean Canvas and Running Lean**

**00:06**
In this video, I'm going to share how I cut my teeth with lean principles many years ago, which led me to accidentally write a best-selling book, create a popular business modeling tool, Lean Canvas, and start a new company that completely changed the trajectory of my entrepreneurial journey.

**00:21**
Hi there, if you're new to this channel, my name is Ash Maurya. I’m an entrepreneur and author, and the creator of the one-page business modeling tool, Lean Canvas. On this channel, I share systematic strategies and techniques for launching and growing a startup.

**00:34**
So our story is set in the summer of 2009. Writing a book back then was never part of my master plan because I was too busy running a software startup at the time.

**00:45**
I had recently launched my second product, BoxCloud, after a hard pivot from a failed first product. The actual product specifics don’t matter all that much, but in case you're curious, BoxCloud was a large general-purpose file-sharing product, like Dropbox, but started two years earlier.

**The Revenue Crisis**

**01:02**
I’d launched it as a freemium software-as-a-service or SaaS product. While I had managed to attract thousands of users, I only had a few dozen paying customers.

**01:13**
The startup had been bootstrapped until this point, but now I was running out of money with only a few months of runway left. That’s also when I considered raising a seed round of funding and I reached out to a few people for advice.

**User Feedback vs. Customer Feedback**

**01:25**
One of them was Nivi, who some of you might recognize as one of the co-founders of AngelList. He had recently taken a class with Steve Blank on customer development, someone who I'd never heard of until then, and instead of connecting me to investors, Nivi advised me to start speaking to my customers.

**01:42**
This was not the response I expected, and so I complained that I had been listening to user feedback all this time and was building features based on that feedback.

**01:52**
That’s when he taught me the difference between user feedback and customer feedback. He told me that:
1. Users use a product, but customers pay for that product. 
2. I should focus on what paying customers want and not what free users want.

**The Epiphany and the Pivot**

**02:05**
That little insight hit me like a ton of bricks back then, and so the next day I reached out to a few of my customers and got them on a phone call with me.

**02:15**
I still vividly remember this one conversation I had with an attorney who told me that he loved my product and shared how it helped him simplify his workflow on sharing large files.

**02:26**
What he couldn’t understand was why I kept complicating the product with more features, and he advised me to stop building more stuff and instead start charging more for what I already had.

**02:36**
He was worried that if I didn’t collect enough money from him, I would go out of business and he’d have to move back to the old solution.

**02:44**
My next few customer conversations sounded similar, which led to a mini epiphany for me. I had been talking to free users all this time who kept asking for more features, and even when I built them, they didn’t buy. On the other hand, I had paying customers asking me for less and wanting to pay me more.

**Repositioning and Growth**

**03:02**
So over the next few weeks, I transitioned my product away from freemium, repositioned my product for business use cases, and managed to charge 10 times more for the same exact product.

**03:14**
I had just experienced the power of good customer insights and decided to go all in and learn everything that I could. I bought Steve Blank’s book, *The Four Steps to the Epiphany*, and followed the trail to Eric Ries, who some of you might recognize as the author of *The Lean Startup*.

**03:29**
He hadn't written the book back then but was sharing a lot of his learning on his blog, *Startup Lessons Learned*, and in talks. I read and watched everything I could find, leaving me with many more questions than answers.

**The Transition to Content Creation**

**03:42**
That’s when I too decided that the best way to get some answers for myself was—no, not to write a book—but to start a blog instead, which would help me clarify my thinking and share my learning publicly.

**03:54**
So in October of 2009, I launched my blog and covered topics like how I was talking and learning from customers, how I was building my minimum viable product, and how I was measuring product-market fit.

**04:05**
Something about these posts struck a nerve with other people and readership started to grow. By March of that following year, some of my readers even started asking me if I would consider turning my knowledge into a book.

**Validating the Book as a Product**

**04:18**
Now, I initially laughed off the idea and did nothing because I was too busy running my own startup. Spending hours writing a blog was hard enough; I couldn't imagine taking a year or more to write a book. Isn't that something you do on a sabbatical in the mountains?

**04:33**
But these suggestions kept coming in, and after about a dozen or so such requests, I realized that this was the first time people were actually trying to pull a product out of me. All this time, I had been the one trying to push a product on them.

**04:48**
This felt very different from my other products and something worth exploring, and so I decided that I was going to invite some of these readers on a call and learn from them.

**05:00**
On the call, I asked them a bunch of questions and, most importantly, I wanted to know who they were, what kind of products they were building, and most importantly, why they wanted me to write this book.

**05:11**
I learned that many of them were early-stage founders like me who had started their startups around a big vision and then gotten stuck. They too had found the early works of Steve Blank and Eric Ries and were also trying to piece together a practical step-by-step way of putting these principles into practice.

**Finding the Unique Value Proposition**

**05:28**
Many of them used words like "simple," "practical," and "step-by-step how-tos" to describe my writing style, which helped me better understand the unique value proposition of my posts and gave me confidence to take the next step.

**05:42**
I quickly outlined a table of contents in a day that I shared with some of these readers and asked them, "If I wrote this book, would you buy?"

**05:51**
Now, they didn’t immediately say yes, but instead gave me more feedback, and after a few iterations, I landed on a book outline that all of them said they’d buy.

**06:01**
Now, while this was early validation, it still wasn’t enough. Getting a dozen readers to agree to buy a book for 20 to 30 dollars was not enough to justify me spending two to three years of my life writing and launching a book.

**Defining Minimum Success Criteria**

**06:14**
I’d done this one too many times before with my other startup products and I didn’t want to repeat the same mistake again. So this time around, I started asking myself, "How would I define success for this book?"

**06:26**
But instead of focusing on how many books I wish I could sell over time, I asked myself a different question. I focused on something I now call the **minimum success criteria**, which estimates the smallest—not largest—outcome that one would use to deem any project a success.

**06:43**
In this case, I asked myself what would be the smallest number of books I would need to sell in a two to three-year period to deem this book project worth doing.

**06:53**
A thousand copies seemed too little; a hundred thousand for a first-time writer seemed out of reach. And so I settled on ten thousand copies.

**07:01**
Assuming a 10% conversion rate, one would need an audience 10 times as big, so a hundred thousand people, and I extrapolated that number backwards and made it a goal to build up my audience for the book using a 10x roadmap.

**07:15**
My goal was to get:
1. 1,000 people on my list in Year 1.
2. 10,000 people in Year 2.
3. 100,000 by the end of Year 3.

**Workshops as the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**

**07:25**
Now, I knew audience building took time, and so I immediately started getting to work. I turned my table of contents into a teaser landing page and announced the book on my blog and also started promoting it in other places.

**07:37**
My goal was to collect at least 1,000 email addresses, which was my litmus test or tripwire for moving forward with the project. Now, it's important to emphasize that during this time, I wasn’t writing the book.

**07:50**
I only spent a few hours a week monitoring my landing page metrics and running promotional campaigns. It wasn't until June, a few months later that year, that I reached my 1,000 email tripwire.

**08:03**
That was my "oh crap" moment. Until now, the book was just an idea in my head, but now it was time to get real.

**08:10**
I started writing that first chapter of the book, but it was a lot harder than I expected. I initially thought the book would be mostly a repackaging of my blog content, but copying and pasting my posts didn't feel right because a lot of my thinking had already changed in just a few months.

**08:26**
I thought to myself, "What had I gotten myself into?" I knew I needed to build something smaller and faster than a book.

**08:34**
Writing a book is like putting together a massive jigsaw puzzle. I needed something like a minimum viable product that allowed me to start testing and iterating while delivering value to customers. "What could serve as an effective MVP for a book?" That was the question.

**08:50**
That’s when I had the idea to use live workshops as that MVP. The reason for this is that the job of a non-fiction book is to teach, and a live workshop does exactly that but in a real-time format.

**Iterative Content Delivery**

**09:03**
So I decided to go with that. I turned my table of contents into a half-day workshop landing page and announced that in Austin where I live.

**09:11**
My first workshop was free and I got 30 people interested. While I’m not a fan of offering free products for a long time, I ran the first one as a trial, did some price testing, and then started charging for subsequent workshops.

**09:24**
I ran these paid workshops throughout those summer months in different cities across the US and even got to travel to Canada.

**09:32**
I bundled a future copy of the book with every workshop ticket, and with every workshop, I was refining the content for the book, not through writing, but by tweaking a slide deck and working on my workshop delivery.

**09:44**
By the end of the summer, I had a 500-page slide deck and a pretty good understanding of what I wanted to write and how I wanted to say it.

**The Pre-Order and Feedback Loop**

**09:52**
But there was another problem. I’d promised my book would be ready by the end of summer, and by now, summer had come and gone. A few people started inquiring about the book, and so I came up with another type of offer for them: the pre-order offer.

**10:06**
I apologized for not finishing the book and told them what I'd been up to with the workshops. I gave them the option to pre-order my book and, in exchange, I promised to deliver them two chapters of the book every two weeks in a PDF format, along with weekly open office hours where I would answer questions about the book.

**10:24**
That way, they wouldn’t have to wait another six months for the book and could get to talk to me as I was writing the book.

**10:30**
Now, I thought most people would surely take me up on this offer, but less than half of my list bought the book. I thought I'd lost half my readers at that point.

**10:38**
I emailed those that didn’t buy and learned that they didn’t want to wait for the finished product. They didn’t want to read the book as a PDF but rather wanted to wait for a finished print version or a Kindle version instead.

**Focusing on True Early Adopters**

**10:49**
Now, my initial reaction as an entrepreneur was to solve this problem right away. I started thinking of ways to support the Kindle format first, which wasn’t hard but definitely a lot of work.

**11:00**
Then I stopped myself. I realized that a PDF was the fastest format for me to support and the fastest way for me to iterate on the book, and I already had enough readers to learn from, which was the original goal of my MVP.

**11:13**
The people who bought my PDF were my true early adopters because they were mostly interested in getting the content no matter the format and didn’t care as much as the others about the packaging.

**11:25**
This was another counter-intuitive learning lesson for me: When searching for early adopters, it's okay to have some sign-up friction because early adopters are usually as excited as you are about your product and willing to jump through a few hoops if needed.

**Continuous Learning and Final Traction**

**11:40**
Now, customer feedback during these two-week iteration cycles was incredibly helpful in accelerating and improving the book from here.

**11:48**
Since I was only releasing two chapters at a time, it was both a small enough batch for my readers to review but also easy for me to quickly incorporate their feedback since they were also testing this content on their own products.

**12:01**
I got a lot more questions and feedback with every update, which helped me write a much better book in just a few months.

**12:08**
Then, when I was about three-fourths of the way through, a surprising thing I never expected happened. I got an email from a major book publisher. They had read my PDF and were interested in publishing the book.

**12:21**
I quickly got them on the phone and the first thing I asked them was why they wanted to publish my book. I assumed that they didn’t know the book was being distributed as a PDF with many copies freely floating around, and that once they found out, they wouldn’t want to publish the book.

**12:37**
They instead told me that they wished more authors wrote their books this way. At first, I was a bit confused, but then it made perfect sense.

**12:44**
The fact that I was able to sell over a thousand copies of the book on my own demonstrated early traction for them, which de-risked the project.

**Conclusion: Traction as Leverage**

**12:53**
The publisher shared with me that the average published book sells only 700 copies at scale, and so I was already ahead of the game. Traction changes everything.

**13:03**
Had I approached the publisher when I was just thinking of the book, when it was just an idea in my head, I would have had to write a book proposal and probably not even get past the gatekeepers without an agent.

**13:15**
This is not unlike how investors view startup ideas today. The ideal time to attract major investors, partners, or publishers—in my case—is after you have demonstrated some traction to show.

**13:27**
This is also when you have the most leverage, which gives you options. Now, that’s exactly what I did. I was able to shop around and negotiate with traction as leverage on my side to pick the best publisher for the project.

**13:40**
I had already sold close to 2,000 copies of the book as pre-orders. The publisher helped me better package the book and we together sold 25,000 copies by the end of Year 2 which, by the way, was way over my initial minimum success criteria of selling 10,000 books in three years.

**13:58**
Now, no one faults you for revising your goals upwards, and so that’s what I did next. The book went on to sell hundreds of thousands of copies, got published in dozens of languages, and is currently in its third edition.

**Universal Principles**

**14:10**
Now, if you look back on this timeline, you might be wondering whether it’s just easier and faster to build a product and then start optimizing.

**14:18**
The problem with this approach is that entrepreneurs are a lot like artists, and like artists, we tend to be perfectionists and often wait too long to release our product into the world.

**14:28**
During this time, it's very easy to go astray and either build too much or build the wrong product entirely.

**14:35**
But when you immerse yourself, like I did, in the world of your customers, you build your product iteratively; not only do you end up building the right product, but more importantly, you get to demonstrate traction to your customers, other customers, and investors, partners along the way, which paves the way forward.

**14:53**
So this is how I turned my early fumbling with lean principles into a best-selling book. I used the same process to launch the Lean Canvas product by turning a blog post on my blog into a software product that is now used by millions of people around the world.

**15:08**
And since then, I’ve launched dozens of other products much the same way. Now, while the tactics can change when launching a book versus software or a service or a physical product, the principles are universal and stay the same.

**15:21**

### **Organized Notes: The Journey of *Running Lean***

**Introduction and Context (00:00 - 01:24)**
*   **Lean Paradox:** Principles are simple to grasp but difficult to execute properly.
*   **Summer 2009:** Ash Maurya was running a software startup (BoxCloud), which was a general-purpose file-sharing tool.
*   **The Problem:** Thousands of users but only a few dozen paying customers. Only a few months of runway remained.

**Key Learning: User vs. Customer Feedback (01:25 - 03:01)**
*   **Advisor Insight:** Nivi (AngelList) recommended talking to customers rather than seeking investors immediately.
*   **Definition:** 
    *   **Users:** People who use the product for free. They often request more features but rarely buy.
    *   **Customers:** People who pay for the product. They usually want simplicity and are willing to pay for reliability.
*   **The Pivot:** By focusing on paying customers (like attorneys), Ash repositioned BoxCloud for business use cases and increased pricing by 10x for the same product.

**Validating the Book Idea (03:02 - 06:13)**
*   **Blog Start (Oct 2009):** Started sharing lean learning publicly. Audience "pulled" the idea for a book.
*   **Customer Interviews:** Talked to readers to understand their specific struggles (getting stuck at the vision stage).
*   **Unique Value Proposition (UVP):** Simple, practical, step-by-step guidance.
*   **Table of Contents (TOC) Test:** Shared a draft TOC with readers to gauge purchase intent.

**Defining Success and Building the MVP (06:14 - 09:02)**
*   **Minimum Success Criteria:** Set the bar at 10,000 copies in 3 years (the minimum needed to make the effort worthwhile).
*   **10x Roadmap:** Broke down the goal into annual milestones for audience growth (1k, 10k, 100k).
*   **The "Oh Crap" Moment:** Hit the 1,000-subscriber milestone and had to start writing.
*   **MVP Strategy:** Writing a book is slow; Ash used **live workshops** as the MVP. 
*   **Teaching as Testing:** Workshops allowed him to refine content through a 500-page slide deck rather than long-form writing.

**Iteration and External Validation (09:03 - 13:02)**
*   **Pre-Order Model:** Offered a PDF subscription (2 chapters every 2 weeks) plus office hours.
*   **Early Adopters:** Those willing to pay for an unfinished PDF were the true early adopters; they prioritized content over format (Kindle/Print).
*   **Publisher Interest (Dec 2010):** A major publisher reached out after seeing the early traction (pre-sold copies).
*   **Traction as Leverage:** Having pre-sold copies gave Ash the ability to negotiate better terms and skip the traditional agent/proposal hurdle.

**Universal Takeaways (14:10 - end)**
*   **Iterative Immersion:** Immersing in the customer's world prevents building the "wrong" product or overbuilding features.
*   **Demonstrate Traction:** Traction is the primary currency for attracting partners, publishers, and investors.
*   **Principles are Universal:** The same "customer pull" and validation process applied to a book worked for the Lean Canvas software.
