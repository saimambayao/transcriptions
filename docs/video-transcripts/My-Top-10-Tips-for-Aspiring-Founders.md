**How to Create a Powerful Vision Statement for Your Startup**

**The Vision Strategy Pyramid**

**00:00**
When entrepreneurs get hit with an idea, too many founders make the mistake of rushing up this vision, strategy, and product pyramid only to prematurely fall in love with their product.

**00:10**
This is the classic build-first or product-first approach where the tendency is to lead with what you are building instead of taking the requisite time to first get your vision and strategy in order. 

**00:20**
Vision and strategy are foundational layers without which even a good product cannot withstand the weight of its market and can come crumbling down.

**00:29**
But how do you build a simple yet powerful vision statement that:
1. Defines your mission?
2. Aligns your team?
3. Shapes your strategy?

**00:39**
That's what I'm going to cover in this video. Hi there, if you're new to this channel, my name is Ash Maurya. I'm an entrepreneur and author and the creator of the popular one-page business modeling tool, Lean Canvas. On this channel, I share systematic strategies and techniques for starting and growing a business.

**The Golden Circle: Starting with "Why"**

**00:53**
So let me start by defining the job of a good vision statement. A good vision statement starts with communicating your "why." Maybe you've come across this talk from Simon Sinek on the golden circle. 

**01:06**
In this talk, he made a case for how great leaders communicate differently.
* They lead with their "why" or purpose.
* Then describe their "how" or unique value proposition.
* And finally describe what they do—their product.

**01:19**
He opens the talk by asking: "Why is Apple so innovative? Why are we perfectly okay buying an MP3 player from them, but not from Dell?" Both are computer companies with access to similar resources, talent, and media. 

**01:32**
This talk was delivered after Apple released their first outlier product, the iPod, which is where the MP3 player question comes from. It was so different from their other laptop and desktop products that it led them to drop the word "computer" from their name, opening the way for Apple to transcend category over the next few years. 

**01:52**
Today you can extend this same question to ask why are we perfectly okay with buying:
1. Smartphones
2. Tablets
3. Watches
4. And smart speakers from Apple in addition to computers?

**02:02**
The reason is that Apple communicates differently. They lead with why they do what they do versus just talking about what they do. Simply by reversing the order of how they present their golden circle, Apple is able to inspire action both inside and outside the company.

**Vision Strategy Pyramid and the Golden Circle**

**02:20**
Now even though the Simon Sinek talk was on how great leaders communicate, I find that the golden circle is just as applicable to how founders should think of their startups and it maps perfectly to the vision strategy product pyramid. 

**02:34**
* Vision maps to your "why."
* Strategy to your "how."
* And product to your "what."

**02:38**
So before rushing to what you're going to build, start with your "why."

**What a Vision Statement Should Be**

**02:43**
So what does a good vision statement look like? A quick online search will reveal a list like this:
1. Inspire people with a clear picture of the future.
2. Focus on a shared goal.
3. Reflect your core values.

**02:58**
The problem is that when you attempt to fit all this into one statement, you easily end up with a bland and generic 50 to 60 word MBA-like mission statement that sounds like this: 

**03:09**
"The mission of (insert any company here) is to deliver superior quality products and services for our customers and communities through leadership, innovation, and partnerships (blah blah)..." 

**03:21**
Guy Kawasaki makes a strong case for ditching this MBA mission statement and instead opting for a 3 to 5 word statement mission that serves like a mantra and creates meaning. 

**03:32**
Here are some iconic examples:
* "Organizing the world's information" - Google
* "Accelerating the transition to sustainable energy" - Tesla
* "Authentic athletic performance" - Nike

**03:45**
I know that when most people think of Nike, they probably think "Just Do It." That's their tagline, which is different but related to a vision statement. With Apple, "Think Different" might come to mind, which I'll get to a little bit later also.

**03:58**
But Apple's early mission statement was really around democratizing access to technology. Both Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were driven to use innovation to empower people through technology and make a positive impact on society.

**How to Craft a Vision Statement**

**04:12**
We'll clarify this or simplify this even further in the next section. Notice how none of these sound like they came from a corporate mission statement generator. They're clear, concise, and create meaning. More importantly, they all start with "why."

**04:27**
Now I'm guessing that you have probably seen these examples before and maybe even struggled to create something as memorable for your own startup. I know that I certainly have. 

**04:36**
And so in the next section, I'll show you how to break this down into three manageable steps and I'll use these three steps to show you how I created a vision statement for my company, LEANSTACK.

**Step 1: Identifying the "Who"**

**04:50**
Before you start with why, I find it super focusing to start with who. You have to get razor focused on who or, more specifically, who it's for. Because when you try to address everyone, you end up addressing no one. 

**05:03**
For Nike, their "who" is athletes. Everything they do is in the service of helping create better athletes. Your "who" is the hero in your startup story. 

**05:13**
In fact, Steve Jobs was so inspired by Nike's ads and positioning where they never compared themselves to other shoe companies like Reebok and instead always honored great athletes, that it led him to launch their own famous "Think Different" campaign where they made their "who" creatives who changed the world, or as he referred to them, "the crazy ones." 

**05:33**
A good prompt for finding your "who" is applying the following to your startup:
* Don't build a better (x); build a better user of (x).

**05:41**
For Nike, that's build better athletes. For Apple, that's build better creatives. I use this prompt to find the right "who" for my startup as well. 

**05:50**
Like many entrepreneurs, I too had rushed up the product pyramid and after a few false starts and pivots, I finally discovered my "who" as entrepreneurs and, more specifically, startup founders.

**Step 2: Value Creating Action**

**06:01**
The mission or reason for being shifted from just being around building cool and awesome products to building better startup founders. And that single mindset shift not only clarified my mission, but it completely changed my trajectory as a startup founder.

**06:21**
Now I'm sure you can probably appreciate the focusing power of identifying your "who," but it's just as important to identify who it's *not* for. 

**06:30**
For example, at LEANSTACK, we focus exclusively on putting founders-first—not investors, not service providers, and not even advertisers—only founders. 

**06:41**
So whenever we're confronted with a new feature or product idea, or even a sponsorship campaign for this channel, we always ask: "Will this help or distract us from making better founders?" If it doesn't help, we just don't do it.

**06:54**
Once you have your "who," the next step is identifying the value-creating action your "who" or hero takes in their journey of getting better. This becomes the verb in your mantra:
* "Athletes perform" (Nike)
* "Creatives make or create stuff" (Apple)

**07:11**
Think of this as further defining what "better" means for your customers. What makes a better athlete? In the case of Nike, that's performance. This is how Nike, for instance, arrived at "authentic athletic performance."

**Step 3: Goal Definition**

**07:24**
When crafting your own value-creating action, you can either choose to focus on helping your customers achieve their goal or removing obstacles standing in the way of their goal. "Authentic athletic performance" is an example of helping athletes achieve their goal. 

**07:39**
For LEANSTACK, I chose instead on removing obstacles for my customers. Founders start companies but they do so under dismal odds of success: 9 out of 10 startups fail. 

**07:51**
And so I chose our mission to be "helping startup founders succeed." A few years in my journey, I also realized that founders are no longer limited to just starting in Silicon Valley or some other startup hotspot—founders are everywhere. 

**08:05**
And so I evolved this statement to "helping startup founders everywhere succeed." And even more recently, I shortened this even further to "democratizing entrepreneurship." 

**08:16**
It's simple, meaningful, and I'll get to measurable in the next section. But more importantly, it serves as our foundation—every product decision, every strategy, every feature flows from this vision statement.

**08:29**
I share this story to highlight that your vision statement can and will change over time and that's perfectly okay. You don't need to worry about getting it perfect—start with a first draft and iterate from there. Even "create better startup founders" is a perfectly good first draft.

**Step 4: Tracking Success Metric**

**08:46**
The final step is identifying your north star metric or key traction metric that you're going to measure. This step helps you ballpark how you will know that you're creating enough better athletes or creatives or founders or whoever the hero is in your startup story. 

**09:01**
While a mantra creates meaning, it should also be measurable, or its meaning loses value over time. My recommendation here is picking not five ways, but just one way to measure it. 

**09:12**
This one traction metric serves as your singular north star compass guiding your journey. This is where I find most people go wrong. They either don't set any clear goals or try to set overly ambitious and fictional 10-year goals when they can barely see six months ahead. 

**09:29**
This is why I instead recommend starting with your minimum success criteria. The minimum success criteria is the smallest outcome that would deem your project a success just three years from now. 

**09:44**
The power of the minimum success criteria is that it helps you start small and adjust from there. Think of the minimum success criteria as the smallest, not largest, outcome that would create meaning for you, then 10x that number to create a worthwhile destination. 

**10:00**
This gives you both a realistic starting point and an ambitious stretch goal or target to strive for. For instance, when I was first considering writing my book "Running Lean" as a side project before there was even a company behind it, I set my minimum success criteria as being able to sell 100,000 books in the first three years, and then 10xed that number to reach my stretch or impact goal of 1 million founders. 

**10:25**
A few years ago we crossed the 1 million founders impact mark and so I 10xed that goal to 10 million founders. Remember that no one ever faults you for revising your goals upwards if and when it's warranted.

**Conclusion**

**10:37**
Having a clear goal makes the mission more concrete which in turn shapes your how and defines your what. In other words, it shapes your strategy and defines the products you build all in service of the mission.

**10:51**
This is what our complete vision strategy product pyramid looks like:
* **The mission** is to democratize entrepreneurship or help create more successful founders everywhere. 
* **We do this by** creating simple and practical startup playbooks that help turn the often chaotic startup journey into something more manageable and systematic. 
* **And this in turn** drives everything we build—tools, content, and coaching resources.

**11:16**
In all fairness, I didn't sketch this visual in one sitting. Most ideas start with a little spark—maybe we see a problem that needs to be solved or we get inspired with a solution idea. 

**11:26**
But before rushing up the pyramid and getting lost in the product world where weeks can quickly turn into months or years, I would highly recommend creating space to even roughly craft a starting vision statement. 

**11:39**
I recommend:
1. Starting with who's it for?
2. Then defining your unique value proposition
3. And figure out product details from there. 

**11:47**
A good exercise for distilling clarity around your big idea is sketching a one-page Lean Canvas. It takes less than 20 minutes to do and you can create one for free at leancanvas.com. Thanks for watching and until next time, take care.

### **Organized Notes**

**Foundational Concepts**
* **The Vision Strategy Product Pyramid [00:03]**: founders often rush to build the product first, but without vision and strategy, the product may fail in the market.
* **The Golden Circle [01:06]**: Derived from Simon Sinek, this framework suggests starting with **"Why"** (vision/purpose), then **"How"** (strategy/value proposition), and finally **"What"** (product).

**Crafting Your Vision (Mantra)**
* **Ditch the MBA Mission Statement [03:21]**: Generic corporate speak fails to inspire. Use a 3 to 5 word mantra (e.g., Google's "Organizing the world's information").
* **Focus on the Hero ("Who") [04:50]**: Identify exactly who the product is for.
    * **Prompt [05:38]**: Don't build a better product; build a better user of that product (e.g., Nike builds better athletes).
* **The Value-Creating Action [06:54]**: Define the "verb" of your mission—what is the hero actually doing?
    * Success could be helping them achieve a goal or removing an obstacle (e.g., "Helping startup founders succeed").

**Measuring the Vision**
* **The North Star Metric [08:46]**: Pick one singular metric to gauge progress. 
* **Minimum Success Criteria (MSC) [09:33]**: Define the smallest outcome that would make the project a success 3 years from now. 
    * **Rule of 10x**: Take your MSC and multiply by 10 to define your long-term stretch goal.

**Execution and Iteration**
* **Iterative Process [08:35]**: Your vision statement can change as the business evolves (e.g., from "democratizing access" to "democratizing entrepreneurship").
* **Lean Canvas [11:50]**: A tool for mapping out these assumptions quickly (under 20 minutes) to gain clarity before building.
