**How to Build a Powerful Vision Statement**

**Introduction: A Shift in Founder Identity**

**00:00** 
A few years ago I attended a session by Kathy Sierra at South by Southwest in Austin, which completely changed my identity as a startup founder. If you had asked me what I did before that session, I would have told you that I was a technical founder who built software products. Software was my world and my identity. 

**00:19** 
Today, I don't just build software products, but write books, deliver keynotes, run workshops and coaching programs, and have even built a few physical products. Breaking out of the solution context changed not only my identity as a startup founder but also the trajectory of my startup and business model. And it's something I recommend every startup founder consider doing.

**00:40** 
Hi there, if you're new to this channel, my name is Ash Maurya and I'm the author of Running Lean and the creator of the one-page business modeling tool, Lean Canvas. On this channel I share systematic strategies and techniques for starting and growing a business.

**The Solution Context vs. The Bigger Context**

**00:54** 
And so this session at South by Southwest couldn't have come at a better time. At the time I was busy running an early-stage software startup but at a crossroads. My blog, which I had created as a personal accountability system and a way to clarify my thoughts on products and entrepreneurship, was starting to take more and more of my time, and one post in particular had recently taken off. 

**01:17** 
In it, I share an early version of a one-page business modeling template, Lean Canvas, as a remix of the original Business Model Canvas by Alex Osterwalder. The outflow of feedback and interest in this template had been unexpected, and after a few readers created their own online versions of the Lean Canvas, I wondered if I should do the same and offer it up as a SaaS product. 

**01:40** 
Now my advisors didn't think that was a good idea. For one, it would take me away from my core startup product and possibly be a distraction. Two, there was no guarantee that people would find the canvas useful enough to pay for it. And, as one advisor put it, even if some people on my blog are using it now, the big question is, will they use it over time? In other words, will it scale? 

**02:03** 
Now while I agreed with their arguments, I couldn't shake off this feeling that there was something here, but I didn't know the best way to proceed. That's when I attended Kathy's session, and this one concept of focusing on the bigger context helped me find a path forward. 

**02:19** 
She talked about how every product in the world lives in two contexts: as a tool in the solution context, but also in a much bigger and more compelling context. 

**Focusing on Desired Outcomes**

**02:29** 
When a photographer is trying to impress someone, they don't talk about being the best tripod expert; they talk about and, better yet, show their photographs. In this example, tripods and cameras are tools that live in the solution context, and photography is the bigger and more compelling context. 

**02:47** 
Another way to think about this is that your product's features live in the solution context, and your customer's desired outcomes live in the bigger context. And desired outcomes, not product features, are what people really care and talk about. 

**The Vision Prompt: Better Users, Not Better Products**

**03:01** 
And then she shared the following prompt for uncovering a product's bigger context: "Don't build a better [x]. Build a better user of [x]." It's a perspective shift from making better products to making better users of your product. 

**03:15** 
And here's how you would apply it if you're a camera manufacturer: "Don't make a better camera, make a better photographer." Now sure, focusing on making better photographers might lead you back to building better features and making better cameras, but this shift in perspective can lead to more profound insights. 

**03:33** 
For instance, you could also make better photographers by teaching people how to take better pictures through a course or online class. Here your camera features don't change, but people's ability to use them to take better pictures does, and once they start seeing the world around them in higher resolution, they buy more cameras and lenses and tripods from you. 

**03:54** 
Or you could completely forgo the need for educating people in the first place on how to use cameras by making them dead simple to use. Now while the Canons and Sonys and Nikons of the world were building more powerful features into their camera, Apple came along and showed everyone how to become a better photographer by using something they already had in their pockets—a smartphone. 

**04:17** 
Instead of trying to make sense of all these features by reading a manual or attending a class to learn about F-stop and aperture, you could just pull out your phone and click a single button. They redefined what it means to be a better photographer, and you can see the impact smartphones had on the camera industry in this chart. 

**The Three Benefits of This Perspective Shift**

**04:36** 
Shifting perspective from better features to better users has three immediate benefits:
1. It forces you to define the hero in your product story. And no, this isn't you or your product, but your customer. 
2. Heroes don't start out as heroes, and that's where you come in. Your job is to build something that turns ordinary customers into superheroes. 
3. Finally, as you saw with this simple example, shifting focus from delivering better product features to better customer outcomes can help you transcend your product category and move from the solution context to the more compelling, bigger context.

**05:15** 
And this is why it's completely okay for a camera company to offer photography training and how a smartphone completely disrupted the camera industry. 

**Applying the Framework to Ash’s Business**

**05:24** 
My mini-epiphany happened when I tried applying this framing to my startup. At the time I was building software that simplified the transfer of large files. But as I completed this sentence: "Don't make a better file-sharing product, make a better [____]," I struggled to fill in the blank. 

**05:41** 
Not because I didn't know who my customers were; my biggest customer segment at the time were wedding photographers who needed to organize and move large files quickly after a wedding shoot. I struggled not because I didn't know who my customers were, but because I had founded my company around a technology vision and had already pivoted customer segments a few times. 

**06:03** 
Where the market led me was not where I thought I'd end up. While there is nothing inherently wrong about wedding photographers, I wasn't into photography myself or weddings for that matter and couldn't see myself getting fired up about their bigger context. I realized then that I had more passion for my solution—the technology side of things—than my customer. And that was a problem. 

**06:26** 
It explained my many hours on my blog posts and why I wanted to keep working on tools like the Lean Canvas. It became clear to me that I either needed to find a co-founder or team member who had the drive and passion for photography to grow my current startup or I needed to do something else entirely. 

**06:46** 
Now I eventually chose the latter, which wasn't a simple decision, and here is how I went about evaluating my options. I started by applying Kathy Sierra's prompt to my Lean Canvas product and wrote down: "Don't make a better [Business Model Canvas], make a better [Startup Founder]." 

**07:02** 
This begged the obvious next question: What do early-stage startup founders struggle with, and more importantly, what could I possibly do to help? To get some answers, I interviewed several of my blog readers. I wanted to understand their more compelling bigger context and more specifically how they saw the Lean Canvas fitting into that picture. 

**The Workshop Strategy and Concierge MVP**

**07:23** 
What immediately struck me was that no one cared about whether the Lean Canvas was online or not, or the long list of features I had already dreamt up of building—things like versioning of canvases and other collaboration features. Everyone I talked to was struggling to turn their big idea into a working business model and was looking for a prescriptive step-by-step framework they could follow. 

**07:46** 
That's when I realized that was their bigger context and I didn't need to build software to deliver that. And so instead I designed a one-day paid workshop where I showed people how I was using the Lean Canvas in my startup. Instead of an online tool, I used printouts of the Lean Canvas template, and that's also when I discovered another benefit of transcending category and breaking out of your solution context, and that was speed of learning. 

**08:13** 
These workshops gave me a front-row seat to my customers, helping me see how they used the Lean Canvas, where they got stuck, and how to improve it. In the lean startup world today, we now call this tactic a concierge MVP, where you first become the product and deliver value through a service, which is a much faster way to learn than building a fully baked product first. 

**08:35** 
And because I was using printouts in the workshop versus having to write and build software, these were essentially a paper prototype that I could quickly iterate on and make changes a whole lot faster as well. 

**08:47** 
For instance, one of my goals was to make the Lean Canvas as intuitive as possible. I didn't want people to have to read a manual or a book to create one. And so at the start of every workshop, I would hand out the canvas, set a timer for 20 minutes, and ask people to create their first snapshot without any instruction whatsoever. Then I'd watch where they got confused or stuck. That's how I learned what to simplify on the Lean Canvas, and I test these improvements over time in future workshops. 

**09:17** 
Once I had a version that worked repeatedly, that's when I turned my paper prototype into a software tool and started using that in my workshops instead of the printouts. Again, seeing where people got stuck allowed me to improve the usability of the product, and once the Lean Canvas tool was good enough for the workshop, I opened it to the public. 

**09:38** 
And even then I didn't just offer people the tool because remember that people don't care about tools, but their bigger context. I turned my workshop content into a book, Running Lean, which taught people how to use Lean Canvas to iterate their big idea from concept through product-market fit, and I built a bunch of simple courses to go along with it. 

**09:58** 
Writing a book can be an even bigger undertaking than building software, and so I used a very similar process for iteratively testing and selling my book before I wrote it. If you're interested in that story, you can check out this video over here. 

**The Evolution into LEANSTACK**

**10:13** 
Now I did all of this as a side project while running my core startup, and once I validated for myself that there was enough demand for these products and that I could see a business model materializing, that's when I decided to sell my original startup and go all in in finding more ways to make better startup founders under a new company called LEANSTACK. 

**10:34** 
Notice that I didn't call it Lean Canvas because that too would have been too solution-centric and too limiting. Now sure enough along the way, more tools got built, another book got written, and a series of step-by-step playbooks started taking shape. 

**10:48** 
And that's when I revisited this prompt again: "Don't make a better ____, make a better startup founder," and realized that the left half didn't really matter all that much. And so I simplified it even further to just: "Make better startup founders." 

**11:05** 
And this is how I now think of our true product at LEANSTACK. Writing books, building business modeling tools, and creating frameworks were never part of the original secret master plan. While they seemed random and disconnected at the start, it's easy to see in hindsight now how they were built and how they align with the overall mission. 

**Transcend Category through Innovation**

**11:25** 
Transcending the solution context and chasing the bigger context has been a fundamental mindset shift for me and a game-changer, and something I recommend that you also consider applying in your business. Product optimization lives in the solution context; this is where you search for better features. But product innovation lives in the bigger context; this is where you search for different and better outcomes, which is how you stand out as a startup founder.

### **Organized Notes**

**The Core Concept: Shifting Context [02:19]**
*   Every product exists in two spaces: 
    1.  **The Solution Context:** Focusing on the tool itself and its features (e.g., a tripod, a camera).
    2.  **The Bigger Context:** Focusing on what the customer is actually trying to achieve (e.g., photography).
*   **Customer Interest:** People don't care about the features of a tool; they care about their own **desired outcomes [02:47]**.

**The Vision Prompt: Kathy Sierra's Framework [03:01]**
*   **The Maxim:** "Don't build a better [x]. Build a better user of [x]."
*   **Goal:** Turn your customer into a "superhero" by enabling them to achieve better outcomes.
*   **Example (Cameras):** Don't make a better camera; make a better photographer. Apple disrupted the industry by making photography accessible via smartphones rather than just adding features to professional DSLRs.

**Three Primary Benefits of Shifting Focus [04:36]**
1.  **Defining the Hero:** It shifts the story from the product to the customer.
2.  **Creating Superheroes:** It identifies the roadmap to turn ordinary users into high achievers.
3.  **Transcending Categories:** It allows a business to move beyond just being a "tool" and into a more meaningful mission.

**Practical Application: Concierge MVPs and Learning [08:13]**
*   **Service First:** Instead of rushing to build software, Ash started with a paid workshop. This is a **Concierge MVP**, where you deliver value manually to learn exactly where customers struggle.
*   **Speed of Learning:** Manual workshops and paper prototypes allowed for faster iteration than software development.
*   **Iterative Design:** By observing where users got stuck on a physical printout of the Lean Canvas, Ash simplified the tool to make it intuitive.

**Case Study: The Evolution of LEANSTACK [10:13]**
*   **Initial Mistake:** Being "solution-centric" on file-sharing technology.
*   **Refining the Vision:** Shifting from "building a better business model tool" to "making better startup founders."
*   **Company Naming:** Avoiding a solution-centric name (like "Lean Canvas") allowed the company to expand into books, coaching, and various playbooks under **LEANSTACK**.

**Summary: Optimization vs. Innovation [11:37]**
*   **Product Optimization:** Focuses on better features (Solution Context).
*   **Product Innovation:** Focuses on different and better outcomes (Bigger Context). This is the key to standing out as a startup.
