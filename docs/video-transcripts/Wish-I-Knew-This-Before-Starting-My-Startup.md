**How to Avoid the $500,000 Innovator's Bias**

**Introduction: The Danger of Being First**

**00:00**
I thought being early and first-to-market was an advantage. Instead, it was the reason I failed. This mistake cost me five hundred thousand dollars and one of my first startup products. And the worst part: I see founders making it every single day. 

**00:14**
I call it the "Innovator's Bias": believing that if you build it, they will come. But that only works in the movies. Today, I'll show you the Evidence Ladder, the exact framework to make sure you're building something people actually want.

**Case Study: The Failure of 6degrees**

**00:28**
It's 2004 and I'm two years into building 6degrees. I invested five hundred thousand dollars of my own money from my last startup's exit, hired a team, and built every feature on our roadmap. Then launch day arrives, and we send it to our thousand-person waiting list. 

**00:46**
Day one, we get a few hundred sign-ups, but by day 30, we have just a handful of people left using the product and no one is paying. Two years of work, five hundred thousand dollars spent, and nobody wanted what we built. 

**00:59**
The worst part: early warning signs were everywhere. I just refused to see it. When we interviewed potential customers while we were building the product, they all said the same thing: "This sounds really interesting." Not "I need this now," not "how much it costs," just "interesting." 

**01:16**
I convinced myself that "interesting" meant they liked what they saw and that when we actually got to build out the product, they'd surely buy it and use it. I was wrong. And it wasn't until a few years down the road that I truly understood why. 

**The Innovator's Bias Explained**

**01:31**
What people say they'll do seldom matches up with what they actually do. That's also when I coined the term "The Innovator's Bias." Like other cognitive biases, biases cloud our thinking with false beliefs. 

**01:44**
A common false belief that many founders have is believing that our innovative idea is so revolutionary that normal rules don't apply to us. "Nobody's done this before," we proudly say. But here's the truth: if nobody's done it before, there's usually a good reason for that. 

**Three Common Pitfalls of the Innovator's Bias**

**02:04**
The Innovator's Bias shows up, I find, in three ways. Number one: Solution-First Thinking. We fall in love with our solution before understanding the problem. I was so excited about 6degrees' technology that I never searched for real underlying problems worth solving. 

**02:18**
The counter-intuitive insight here is that customers don't care about your solution, but their problems. 

**02:24**
Number two: Stealth Mode Delusion. We work in secret, afraid someone will steal our idea. I did that for two years. Meanwhile, nobody even knew we existed. 

**02:35**
The counter-intuitive insight here is that ideas are shaped and evolved through continuous sharing and feedback loops with customers, not by practicing stealth. 

**02:45**
Number three: The Killer Feature Fallacy. We think if we just add one more feature, customers will finally get it. But features don't create demand, problems do. And we're back to "love the problem, not your solution." 

**03:01**
The Innovator's Bias blinds us to the most important question: Is anyone desperately looking for what you're building? This is where the Evidence Ladder comes in. 

**The Evidence Ladder: Level 1**

**03:10**
After 6degrees failed, I developed the Evidence Ladder, which is made up of four levels of customer validation that reveal if you have real demand. 

**03:20**
Level 1: Stated Interest (Worthless). This is where you hear things like:
* "That sounds really cool."
* "I'd probably use that."
* "Interesting idea, come back in six months."

**03:32**
These are "what customers say" statements and they are quite worthless because they carry little evidence strength. Remember: what people say they'll do seldom predicts what they'll actually go on to do in the future. This is where I stopped with 6degrees, which was a big and costly mistake. 

**The Evidence Ladder: Levels 2 and 3**

**03:46**
Level 2: Actively Searching (Valuable). This is where you find people searching for solutions online, joining forums, asking for help, or complaining on social media. If nobody's actively looking for a solution, chances are you're solving a problem that they don't even know they have. 

**04:04**
Level 3: Paying for Existing Solutions (Gold). Many founders think that if their customers are already using a solution, that's a really bad thing. But the exact opposite is true. 

**04:16**
It's far easier to make someone switch from an existing solution than convince them to try something totally new for the first time—provided, of course, that your new solution is better enough to warrant that switch. 

**04:30**
The other reason that this is higher up on the Evidence Ladder is that when people are already paying for bad solutions, they'll happily transfer at least that much money to you for a better solution. 

**The Evidence Ladder: Level 4**

**04:41**
However, here too many founders conflate willingness to pay and promises to pay with actual payment, which is why there is a fourth rung to the Evidence Ladder. 

**04:51**
Level 4: Prepaying You to Build Your Solution (Jackpot). When you can pitch your idea and secure pre-orders, downpayments, or a letter of intent, that's where the rubber really hits the road. This is ideally where you want to be before writing a whole bunch of code or building out your product. 

**05:09**
The higher up the ladder you are, the stronger your evidence strength. And most founders never get past Level 1. 

**How to Climb the Evidence Ladder**

**05:17**
Here is how to climb this Evidence Ladder systematically using a validation playbook. Step 1 in the playbook: The Magic Question. Stop asking "would you use this?" and start asking "what are you currently doing to solve this problem?" 

**05:33**
If the answer is "nothing" or you see your customers confused, you don't have a problem worth solving yet. 

**05:39**
Step 2: Follow the Money. Find where the money is already being spent. What are people paying for, even bad solutions? That's your market for the taking. 

**05:49**
Step 3: Use the 20-10-7 Rule.
1. Talk to 20 potential prospects to understand their problems and map the opportunity space.
2. Pick your beachhead market segment or early adopters carefully.
3. Use the "Demo-Sell-Build" framework to then pitch your product to 10 of your ideal early adopters. 

**06:07**
Aim to secure at least 7 tangible commitments where they don't just verbally commit, but commit with tangible payments or other proxies for tangible commitment. 

**Problem-Solution Fit and WYSIWYG**

**06:17**
If you can't do this, in my book, you don't have Problem-Solution Fit; you have a hypothesis. Problem-Solution Fit is the minimum validation I now seek with any new idea before investing months or years of my time on that idea. 

**06:33**
And after Problem-Solution Fit, you are then ready for Step 4. Step 4: Build Only What You Sold. The magic of the Demo-Sell-Build process is that it follows WYSIWYG: What You See Is What You Get. 

**06:45**
You only get to build what you showed customers who pre-purchased your product, and nothing more. You don't have to guess or worry about scope creep. 

**06:53**
Your goal is simply to deliver on the exact promise you made, and if you get to do that, you get to keep those customers, which is the next major milestone to aim for: Solution-Customer Fit. 

**Conclusion: Innovation is About Being Right**

**07:05**
Think of Solution-Customer Fit as a small-scale version of Product-Market Fit. If you can't make your first 10 carefully handpicked early adopters happy, how are you going to make hundreds or thousands of other people happy? 

**07:18**
The Innovator's Bias cost me five hundred thousand dollars and two years of my first solo startup product, but it taught me something invaluable. Innovation isn't just about being first—it's about being right. 

**07:30**
Being right means:
* Right problem
* Right solution
* Right timing
* Right market

### **Organized Notes**

**Understanding the Innovator's Bias**
* **00:14** – Believing that building a product automatically guarantees a customer base ("If you build it, they will come").
* **01:31** – A cognitive bias where founders mistake verbal interest ("That's interesting") for actual demand.
* **01:44** – The false belief that an idea is so "revolutionary" that standard market rules and validation steps do not apply.

**The Three Pillars of Failure**
1. **02:04 - Solution-First Thinking:** Prioritizing the product over understanding the actual problem. Customers pay for solutions to their problems, not for technology.
2. **02:24 - Stealth Mode:** Hiding the idea to prevent "theft," which stops the necessary feedback loops required to evolve the product.
3. **02:45 - Killer Feature Fallacy:** The belief that one more feature will solve the lack of demand. Demand is driven by problems, not feature counts.

**The Evidence Ladder (Hierarchy of Validation)**
* **Level 1: Stated Interest [03:20]** – Worthless. Verbal praise or "interesting" comments.
* **Level 2: Actively Searching [03:46]** – Valuable. Finding customers already looking for help or complaining about existing issues.
* **Level 3: Paying for Existing Solutions [04:04]** – Gold. Proves there is a budget and a willingness to switch if your product is significantly better.
* **Level 4: Pre-payment [04:51]** – Jackpot. Tangible commitment through pre-orders or letters of intent before building.

**The Validation Strategy (Playbook)**
* **05:23 – The Magic Question:** Ask "What are you currently doing to solve this?" instead of "Would you use this?"
* **05:49 – The 20-10-7 Rule:** 
    * Talk to **20** prospects.
    * Pitch to **10** early adopters using a demo.
    * Secure **7** tangible commitments (payments/contracts).
* **06:33 – WYSIWYG Build:** Only build the exact features sold during the demo to avoid scope creep and ensure Problem-Solution Fit.
