**How to Build a Minimum Valuable Product (MVP)**

**Common Misconceptions of MVP**

**00:00**
Most founders think MVP means launching a product with bare minimum features, but that's exactly why 73% of startups fail after launch. What if I told you that the secret to nailing your MVP isn't building the minimum or the maximum, but rather launching with the right cocktail mix of features that causes customers to want to switch to your product?

**00:21**
Today I'll show you the exact framework I use and have taught to thousands of founders for building what customers want with the least amount of effort and waste. Let me start by talking about why people grossly misunderstand MVPs.

**00:34**
The first hang up I find is on the word minimum. Too many people equate this with a bare minimum product. The problem, of course, with bare minimum is that it gets a lukewarm response. Nobody cares that you can do what your competitors already do; they want to know what you can do that's different and new.

**00:51**
The second challenge is that you can't completely ignore what your competitors are already doing, especially if they offer basic features that your customers already expect—like, say, brakes in a car. No one would ever buy a car that doesn't have brakes, or headlights, or wipers, or a dozen other basic features. People don't buy a car because of these features, but they expect them to be there anyway.

**01:13**
Now for a founder building a new car, these basic features explode the scope of their MVP because you have to build all these things and create something new and different at the same time.

**01:23**
The second hang up I encounter often is on the word viable. What does that really mean? Most people view this, of course, as a product customers will pay for, but where they again go astray is thinking that customers will only pay for a complete product that has all the basic features first, and then they try to sprinkle or layer their differentiation on top.

**01:44**
This lands you back in the world of not building an MVP, but rather an MUP: a maximally undifferentiated product. This is why I stopped viewing MVPs just from the lens of viability and instead refined the V in MVP to mean valuable and not just viable.

**02:01**
A minimum valuable product doesn't just address viability, but also customer desirability and technical feasibility. In other words, you are asking: Will they want this? And can you build this quickly enough?

**02:14**
Desirability is all about the unique value proposition or promise of your product that is different and better than other products that you're competing against. And feasibility is all about your speed of execution. Given enough time, money, and effort, we can build almost anything these days, but customers and, more importantly, competitors don't just wait around forever.

**The Kano Model for Feature Selection**

**02:34**
So how do you determine the right feature cocktail mix for building minimum valuable products? This is where the Kano Model comes in. The Kano Model was developed in the 1980s by Noriaki Kano, where he plotted features showing how they delivered on customer satisfaction versus how sophisticated or built out they were.

**02:54**
What he discovered, not unsurprisingly, is that not all features are created equal. They don't all deliver on the same level of customer satisfaction. He came up with five different archetypes of features.

**03:07**
Type 1 are must-have or basic features. These are table stakes—expected basic features like brakes on a car—that need to be in a product.

**03:18**
Here’s how you read this graph: Customers don't get super excited or delighted when basic features are present, and you can see how satisfaction flatlines after a certain point. But when these features are absent, customers get very dissatisfied.

**03:32**
The next feature type is Type 2: performance features. Here, more is better. These have a linear relationship with customer satisfaction. Sticking with the car example, a good example here of a performance feature is the horsepower or power of the engine, where most customers equate more with better.

**03:51**
Type 3 features are delighters. Think of these as unexpected features that create disproportionate customer happiness. Examples of this in the car might be features like GPS, park assist, and self-driving features. Technically, we don't need any of these features to drive a car, but each of them adds a "wow" factor when they were introduced.

**04:11**
Now it's worth noting that true delighters aren't just gimmicks that attempt to put lipstick on a pig, but rather they solve a real existing problem in a new and different way. Over time, these delighters, if they are the right kind of delighters, eventually transition from being delighters that are only available in early products to becoming must-haves that become mainstream.

**04:34**
You can see this also play out in cars with things like rearview cameras for park assist. They were delighters when they first came out but became mandatory here in the US for vehicles weighing under 10,000 pounds after 2018.

**04:48**
Okay, so moving on. Type 4 is the zone of indifference. These are lukewarm features that just don't move the needle either way. You obviously want to avoid these features at all costs because you end up building features for something that nobody really wants.

**05:02**
And finally, Type 5 are reverse features, which are essentially the inverse of the performance features that we talked about early on. Here, more is actually worse on customer satisfaction. In the car world, think of car emissions. More car emissions is actually worse than being better, and so that's what makes that a reverse feature.

**05:21**
So looking at this list, it should hopefully be readily obvious that a good minimum valuable product needs to avoid the zone of indifference because nobody cares about them, and reverse features. Instead, strive to prioritize their feature cocktail in this order: Delighters first, then Performance, and finally Must-Haves.

**05:40**
The problem, of course, is that true delighters require innovation, which isn't easy, so you can't invest in too many of these. And the must-have features, as we saw earlier, can drain your resources because you need them, but they by themselves aren't enough to cause a switch.

**The 4-Step MVP Cocktail Framework**

**05:58**
So how do you balance the right mix of features? This is where the four-step MVP cocktail that I'm going to cover next comes in. I'll show you exactly how Tesla nailed their MVP using this framework.

**06:07**
Step 1: Build your Unique Value Proposition (UVP) around just one delighter feature to start. The bad news, of course, with delighters is that they are hard to build, but the good news is that you only need one primary delighter that you can highlight in your promise or unique value proposition.

**06:23**
For Tesla, when building electric cars back in 2006, this delighter came from sustainability. All cars of the time had some level of emissions, which as we saw earlier, is a reverse feature. Tesla didn't just promise lower emissions; they wanted to eliminate emissions by promising zero emissions.

**06:41**
This positioning wasn't just about being better than other cars; it was about being categorically different. Everyone else was trying to claim that their car has the best gas mileage, while Tesla was claiming our car has zero emissions. That's a delighter—a completely new benefit category that customers care about.

**07:00**
Step number 2: Don't forget about meeting minimum performance metrics. Now technically, Tesla did not invent electric cars or build the first electric car. What they did do is make electric cars mainstream by ensuring their 100% electric cars could meet certain minimum performance standards.

**07:19**
In their case, this was the range of the car. While there were many concept electric cars that came and went before them, most of them were just souped-up golf carts. The reason they never got serious attention is that they could only go a short distance, like 30 miles or 50 kilometers on a single charge.

**07:35**
In order for it to be taken seriously, to cause a switch from a combustion-powered vehicle, Tesla determined that they needed to have their cars go at least 200 miles, and that was the minimum performance metric they had to deliver on to be taken seriously.

**07:50**
So their internal mandate in the company became delivering an all-electric, zero-emissions car that could go at least 200 miles on a single charge. Hopefully, you can see how delivering on this creates a value proposition that is unique, different, and usable by customers at the same time. Now stopping here can be enough for most products, but Tesla went a step further.

**08:13**
Step 3: Layering in an additional axis of better. You've probably seen the classic 2x2 differentiation matrix where we try to show how our product is in the top right corner in a category of its own making compared to existing alternatives.

**08:27**
That is what step 3 is all about. Being good on just one dimension of good is good, but two is even better. Once Tesla nailed the delighter and minimum performance steps, they added a second delighter feature: acceleration, which for them was a nice side effect of going all-electric.

**08:45**
Because their cars didn't have a multi-gear transmission, they could deliver instant maximum torque, making them go from 0 to 60 very, very quickly.

**08:57**
Now they didn't just bury this fact in a feature list, but rather made it their second axis of better by building an electric sports car and claiming that they were building the fastest and greenest car money can buy. To make sure people got the message, they even arranged many publicity stunts where they raced the Tesla Roadster against other popular supercars.

**09:15**
So this is how they prioritized their MVP to deliver on a compelling and different UVP, but we still have a problem. A car isn't just a battery and an electric motor; it has a hundred other basic features that people expect, all of which take time, money, and effort to build.

**09:31**
A typical car takes 10 years to go from concept to road-ready, but Tesla managed to do this in just two and a half years. How did they pull that off? This is where some out-of-the-box thinking from step 4 comes in.

**09:44**
Step number 4: Innovate around basic features. Tesla's genius move wasn't trying to build their first car from scratch, but instead licensing a pre-built Lotus Motors chassis and plugging their battery into it. They essentially cobbled together their car by using an existing car which was already road-ready, using what we now call the "Wizard of Oz" MVP design pattern.

**10:08**
This allowed them to focus 100% of their innovation resources on one thing: battery technology. Now let me show you exactly how Steve, our virtual reality founder, applied this.

**Case Study: Steve's VR Startup**

**10:18**
His delighter feature came from turning a 2D architectural sketch into a 3D immersive virtual reality experience in minutes, not days, just by taking a few pictures on a mobile phone. You can imagine the look on his architect prospects' faces when he turned one of their architectural sketches into a VR walkthrough right in the pitch meeting itself.

**10:40**
Every other VR platform required tons of training, and this is where Steve made it work in just 30 seconds. That's not just better; that's very, very different.

**10:49**
His minimum performance metric (Step 2) was realizing that his models didn't need to be perfect down to the nearest inch. Just like he used his delighter to close architects, his promise to them was for them to close their homeowner clients on their first meetings too. This was the killer unique value proposition that got his product adopted.

**11:09**
Unlike Tesla, now he couldn't immediately think of a second axis of better, but stumbled into one just a few weeks of doing demos when one of the architects asked him if he could create a walkthrough with specific furniture and appliances already pre-built into the VR walkthrough.

**11:26**
This led him to build a reusable catalog of components that not only led to even more personalized experiences for clients, but turned into his moat or unfair advantage over time against competitors (Step 3).

**11:38**
Before taking this MVP cocktail approach, Steve was drowning in a list of must-have features he thought he needed to build in order to close the deal. But after repositioning his product as a sales tool versus 3D modeling, he was able to reduce his scope and gained instant differentiation.

**11:55**
To make his product a no-brainer, he also implemented Step 4, where he innovated around basic features. While his architect customers loved the idea of using his solution to win clients, they still needed at the end of the meeting to turn their concepts into 3D models and needed more advanced CAD or modeling features to do that.

**12:15**
Instead of Steve building these features himself, he turned to these existing off-the-shelf products that architects were already using and built export and plug-in features that allowed them to quickly bring in their client-approved VR models into their software platform and then refine further from there.

**12:32**
This not only allowed him to move fast on the one thing he needed to move fast on, but also turned several direct competitors into channel partners.

**Conclusion**

**12:41**
Now this 4-step MVP cocktail framework is how I think of every MVP I build. In fact, I'm working on one right now for a new product called LeanSpark, which is an AI co-founder that helps you systematically validate your startup idea.

**12:56**
Many of you in the channel have asked for a more detailed case study on putting the ideas I share on this channel into practice, and this is it. I'm building this product in public where I'm documenting and sharing the exact process I teach on this channel.

**13:08**
Unlike the other case studies I share here, this is a true "over the shoulder" series where even I don't know how things are going to turn out, so you'll get to see my raw process: the good, the bad, and the hard pivots I'm going to make along the way. If you want to follow along, check out the link in the description below.

**13:25**
In addition to the MVP cocktail I shared here, another technique I'm using heavily for this launch is "Demo-Sell-Build," where I'm not starting with building out my product but rather pre-selling the product to establish a minimum viable runaway.

**13:40**
I did a video on this concept a few weeks ago, which from the comments appeared to have polarized a number of people. You can check out that video over here, and if you'd like to see the real-world implementation, then also sign up for the over-the-shoulder series using the link in the description below. Until next time, take care.


### **Organized Notes: The 4-Step MVP Cocktail Framework**

**I. The Core Problem with traditional MVPs**
*   **[00:00]** Founders often launch products with the "bare minimum" features, which fails to convince customers to switch.
*   **[01:44]** Traditional approaches lead to "MUPs" (Maximally Undifferentiated Products).
*   **[01:51]** Reframing "Minimum Viable Product" as **Minimum Valuable Product**.
    *   **Desirability:** Will they want it? (Unique Value Proposition).
    *   **Feasibility:** Can you build it quickly? (Speed of execution).
    *   **Viability:** Will they pay for it?

**II. Categorizing Features (The Kano Model)**
*   **[03:07] Type 1: Must-Haves (Basic Features).** Table stakes. Their presence doesn't delight, but their absence causes extreme dissatisfaction (e.g., brakes on a car).
*   **[03:32] Type 2: Performance Features.** Satisfaction increases linearly with performance (e.g., horsepower).
*   **[03:51] Type 3: Delighters.** Unexpected "wow" factors (e.g., GPS in early cars). These solve real problems in new ways and eventually become must-haves.
*   **[04:47] Type 4: Zone of Indifference.** Features customers don't care about; waste of resources.
*   **[05:01] Type 5: Reverse Features.** Features where "more" is worse (e.g., high emissions).

**III. The 4-Step MVP Strategy**
1.  **[06:07] Step 1: Build UVP around ONE Delighter.** Focus on one categorically different benefit (Tesla: Zero emissions).
2.  **[07:00] Step 2: Meet Minimum Performance Metrics (MPM).** Don't ignore industry standards needed for a product to be taken seriously (Tesla: 200-mile range).
3.  **[08:13] Step 3: Layer an Additional Axis of Better.** Add a second delighter to separate from the pack (Tesla: Sports car acceleration).
4.  **[09:44] Step 4: Innovate Around Basic Features.** Don't build basic features from scratch; license, buy, or use existing platforms to focus resources on your core innovation (Tesla: Using the Lotus chassis).

**IV. Key Execution Techniques**
*   **[10:04] Wizard of Oz MVP Pattern:** Cobbling together existing components to appear as a custom product while focusing on the core unique value.
*   **[13:31] Demo-Sell-Build:** Establish a "minimum viable runway" by pre-selling the concept before the actual build.
