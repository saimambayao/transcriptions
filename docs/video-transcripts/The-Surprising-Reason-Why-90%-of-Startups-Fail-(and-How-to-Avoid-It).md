**The Real Reason Startups Succeed**

**Introduction: The Myth of the Big Problem**

**00:00**
So for a long time I used to think that failing to find a big enough customer problem worth solving was the top reason why startups fail.

**00:07**
But I was wrong about this and so in this video I'm going to break down:
* Why I used to think this way?
* What changed my thinking?
* How I now search for new breakthrough ideas and the one thing I look for.

**00:19**
Hi there, if you're new to this channel, my name is Ash Maurya. I'm an entrepreneur and author and the creator of the one-page business modeling tool Lean Canvas. On this channel I share systematic strategies and techniques for starting and growing a business.

**Startups and the Symptoms of Failure**

**00:32**
So why do startups fail? A quick online search will result in a list of reasons like this one:
1. No funding
2. Poor team
3. Poor product
4. Bad timing
5. No customers
6. Competition

**00:38**
The problem with lists like this is that many reasons cited here are symptoms, not causes.

**00:43**
Let's take the first one for instance: no funding or no money. While it's easy to blame a lack of money for getting stuck in a startup, many companies raise a lot of money and still fail.

**00:54**
Many bootstrap companies start with very little capital and become massively successful and so money by itself does not cause success.

**The Pivot in Thinking: Bill Gross and Timing**

**01:03**
At the core of every successful product is building something people want, which is why I used to think that solving a big enough customer problem was the key to success.

**01:12**
But then I ran into this TED talk by Bill Gross a few years ago and it changed my thinking completely.

**01:18**
Bill is a serial entrepreneur and the founder of Idealab. In this talk he describes how he studied hundreds of companies across five key factors:
1. The quality of the idea
2. The quality of the team
3. The business model
4. Funding
5. Timing

**01:33**
He expected the quality of the idea or team to rank at the very top, but to his surprise, he found that timing was the critical ingredient.

**01:40**
In other words, the same idea with the same team, business model and funding could succeed or fail depending on whether it was too early or too late to market.

**Ash Maurya’s Personal Retrospective on Timing**

**01:50**
After listening to this talk, I looked back through my past products and could certainly see that two of my products suffered from being very early to market, while the one that instantly took off did have great timing.

**02:01**
In 2002 I launched my first product Six Degrees, which was a social networking product even before the term existed.

**02:09**
Later that year, Friendster launched, followed by a dozen other companies. However, the company that managed to create the largest and most successful social network on the planet, Facebook, wasn't among them.

**02:20**
They launched much later in 2004 and completely took over the market.

**02:25**
By 2006 I had pivoted to a file sharing solution named BoxCloud. Similarly, when I launched there were only a handful of other startups in the space until a couple of years later when Dropbox launched and stole the spotlight.

**02:39**
The problem with my products wasn't a lack of a big enough problem worth solving, but timing.

**The Tipping Point and Industry Examples**

**02:45**
Then in 2009 I launched Lean Canvas, which took off almost instantly. This was followed by a best-selling book *Running Lean*, and a year later I started a new company LeanStack which I still run to this day.

**02:56**
In hindsight you could say that Lean Canvas and Running Lean benefited from good timing. I launched both of these products at the tipping point of the Lean Startup movement, which undoubtedly played a significant role in their success.

**03:09**
Now this pattern isn't just limited to these products, you can see it at work in all these companies too. None of these companies were first to market for the products that made them successful.

**03:20**
Google didn't introduce the first search engine, Ford didn't build the first automobile, and Tesla didn't build the first electric car.

**03:26**
None of these companies were first movers, but fast followers with better timing.

**Naval Ravikant: How to Get Lucky**

**03:31**
Now while I was starting to see that timing was a plausible explanation for startup success, something still bothered me. Timing an idea requires being in the right place at the right time.

**03:41**
This felt largely random and dependent on luck, which meant it was out of our control. I started wondering if there was a way to intentionally increase a startup's luck, which led me to Naval Ravikant.

**03:53**
According to Naval there are four ways to get lucky. The first three are most applicable here, which is what I'm going to cover.

**04:00**
First, you can simply stumble into blind luck. This is how we traditionally think of luck. It's also the least actionable way to get lucky and is not directly under our control.

**04:10**
Second, you can increase your luck surface area through hustle or hard work. Working hard is a time slicing hack that attempts to diversify the number of bets you play.

**04:19**
The pitfall here is equating busy work with productive work. If you work hard on the wrong things, you simply keep yourself busy without increasing your luck.

**04:29**
And finally, you can improve your luck by making good decisions. Think of this as working smarter versus working harder.

**04:36**
You do this by investing your time in the right things that stand to drive the biggest impact and ignore everything else.

**Working Smarter: Risks vs. Ease**

**04:46**
Working smarter versus harder on a startup idea means prioritizing what's riskiest, not what's easiest about your idea first.

**04:54**
Then tackling those riskiest assumptions as quickly and early as possible.

**05:00**
And finally using that learning to double down on the idea or pivot it to something better.

**05:05**
The timing of an idea is one of those riskiest assumptions and instead of simply hoping that your idea is well-timed, you can instead take control and test the timing of your idea before going all in.

**The 90-Day Timebox Strategy**

**05:17**
So how much time do you need to do that? After much trial and error, I have found that if you truly make that a priority, you can test the timing of any idea within a 90-day timebox.

**05:28**
Explicitly timeboxing an idea to 90 days holds you and the idea accountable and keeps you from wasting precious time on an idea whose time hasn't yet come.

**05:39**
And instead focus your resources on finding well-timed ideas.

**05:43**
When you test ideas in 90-day cycles rather than one-year or two-year cycles, you move quickly across many different ideas significantly increasing your luck surface area.

**The Three Essential Ingredients of a Well-Timed Idea**

**05:58**
Next let's cover how you test the timing of an idea in just 90 days. I have found that a well-timed idea has three essential ingredients that need to come together: Inflection, Impact, and Insight.

**06:10**
Think of inflection as an external triggering event that signals the potential of a new idea whose time has come. Every successful idea rides on the shoulders of one or more inflections.

**06:21**
It's easy to find many examples of technology inflections such as:
* The steam engine
* The internet
* Now AI

**06:29**
But inflections aren't limited to the introduction of new technologies. Regulatory changes, climate change and even black swan events like the pandemic are all examples of inflections that create openings for new ideas to take hold.

**06:42**
So identifying one or more inflections is the first ingredient, the next is measurable impact.

**06:49**
No matter the promise of an inflection, people tend to ignore inflections until there are real stakes at play.

**06:55**
Climate change is an excellent illustration of this. We've been aware of climate change for decades, but only now are people all over the world witnessing undeniable and measurable impacts on weather patterns.

**07:05**
Which is a necessary ingredient for behavior change.

**Stakes and Insights: The Secret Ingredient**

**07:08**
Stakes can be positioned as aspirational gains like improved productivity or unbearable pain like being left behind if you don't act.

**07:17**
And yes stakes or impact are synonymous with a big customer problem worth solving. This is what I used to think was the most crucial ingredient.

**07:25**
But impact alone without an inflection is often a non-starter.

**07:30**
That said, most startup founders end up sharing similar inflections and many also manage to find positive and negative impacts of these inflections.

**07:38**
But what truly separates successful founders is the third ingredient: Insight.

**07:44**
An insight is a new and often contrarian perspective or way of seeing the world that most other people don't yet see.

**Secrets and Foresight**

**07:51**
Peter Thiel takes this concept even further in his book *Zero to One* in which he labels these insights as secrets.

**07:58**
Like a good magic trick, secrets are simple and obvious in hindsight. The challenge is having the foresight to see them.

**08:04**
To illustrate these concepts in action, let's apply them to my first social networking idea, Six Degrees.

**08:11**
My social networking idea was baked in multiple inflection points. In 2002 we were in the middle of a recession and I had seen many of my friends lose their jobs and relocate to different cities in search of new jobs.

**08:23**
I was in the same boat too. The telecom startup I was working for had just been acquired for a big nine-figure exit and I had decided to leave and venture out on my own.

**The Flawed Insight of Six Degrees**

**08:33**
I'd also recently learned about the six degrees of separation concept, which is this idea that we are all connected by six or fewer social connections.

**08:41**
Even though this is not an original idea, Duncan Watts, a professor at Columbia University, had just tested the concept in 2001 using an experiment he conducted over email.

**08:52**
That's what inspired me to start building Six Degrees as a web application. I of course was not alone.

**08:58**
Like many of the other social networking founders, I believed that people wanted to be connected, but my secret at the time was that I thought they would also value their privacy.

**09:07**
In other words, I didn't think people would openly share their social graphs and personal data on the internet. And so I went to great lengths to build a private social network.

**09:18**
However, as other social networks proved out over time, this was a flawed insight.

**Mark Zuckerberg’s Secret and Successful Insight**

**09:22**
But even building a public social network wasn't enough. Even though Friendster and MySpace grew to millions of users, Facebook came from behind and started growing even faster.

**09:33**
Mark Zuckerberg's secret was quickly recognizing that a social network wasn't about building a new social network, which is what these other companies were doing.

**09:41**
But instead about moving existing social networks like those on college campuses online on the internet.

**09:48**
Social networking wasn't about friending strangers but deepening your existing relationships with friends. This sounds obvious in hindsight, which is a crucial characteristic of good insights.

**Uncovering and Testing Secrets**

**09:58**
So how do you uncover a good secret? A strong belief or a leap of faith is a good start, but often isn't enough.

**10:04**
Good insights are rooted in data and evidence which lead to deep understanding of people's desires, wants, and fears, which is not something you can easily extract just at the surface level.

**10:15**
In 2002 I didn't know how to uncover these insights without first building a product. The problem with first building a product is the sunk cost fallacy.

**10:24**
Once you have built a product on a specific insight, pivoting to something different, while not impossible, is certainly a lot harder because you've invested lots of time, money, and effort into your idea.

**10:34**
Today however we have learned many new strategies and tactics for not only uncovering good insights but also testing them before going all in.

**10:42**
If you're interested in learning how, then you should watch this next video: "Don't Start with an MVP."

**10:48**
Thanks for watching and until next time, take care.

### **Organized Notes**

**Foundational Shift in Philosophy (00:00 - 01:03)**
*   **Old View:** Startups fail because the customer problem isn't big enough.
*   **New View:** While a big problem matters, the true cause of failure is often poor **Timing**.
*   **Symptoms vs. Causes:** Lack of funding is a symptom. Many high-funded projects (Juicero) fail, while bootstrapped ones succeed.

**The Power of Timing (01:18 - 03:31)**
*   **Bill Gross Study:** Analyzing 200+ companies revealed Timing as the #1 factor for success (42%), followed by Team/Execution (32%), Idea (28%), Business Model (24%), and Funding (14%).
*   **Historical Evidence:** 
    *   **Six Degrees (2002):** Too early.
    *   **Facebook (2004):** Perfect timing, fast follower.
    *   **Google/Ford/Tesla:** None were first movers; all were fast followers with superior timing.
*   **Lean Startup Movement:** Ash Maurya’s own success with Lean Canvas (2009) was tied to the tipping point of this industry movement.

**Intentional Luck (03:31 - 04:46)**
*   **Naval Ravikant’s Luck Categories:**
    1.  **Blind Luck:** Random, non-actionable.
    2.  **Luck Surface Area (Hustle):** Creating opportunities through volume of work.
    3.  **Good Decisions (Work Smarter):** Improving luck by prioritizing high-impact choices.
*   **Startups:** Working smarter means prioritizing the **riskiest assumptions** rather than the easiest tasks.

**The 90-Day Timebox (05:17 - 05:58)**
*   **Strategic Constraint:** Any idea can be tested for timing within 90 days.
*   **Accountability:** Prevents the sunk cost fallacy of spending years on an ill-timed concept.
*   **Luck Surface Area:** Testing ideas in 90-day cycles (versus year-long cycles) allows for more "shots on goal" and a higher chance of hitting a well-timed window.

**The Three Ingredients of Well-Timed Ideas (05:58 - 07:43)**
1.  **Inflection:** An external trigger (Tech like AI, regulatory shifts, or events like the pandemic).
2.  **Impact:** Real stakes that drive behavior change (Measurable pain or gain). Solving a problem alone isn't enough; it must have an active inflection behind it.
3.  **Insight:** A contrarian "secret" that is obvious in hindsight but hard to see beforehand.

**Lessons from the Social Networking War (08:04 - 09:57)**
*   **Ash’s Mistake (Six Degrees):** His insight focused on *privacy*. He believed people wouldn't want to share data publicly. History proved this wrong.
*   **Zuckerberg’s Success (Facebook):** His insight was that social networking should move *existing* offline networks (colleges) online and focus on *deepening* relationships rather than meeting strangers.

**Conclusion: Secrets and Sunk Costs (09:58 - 10:52)**
*   **Data vs. Surface Belief:** Insights must be rooted in deep data about desires and fears, not just surface-level observations.
*   **Build Last:** Don't build a product before uncovering and testing your insight to avoid the **Sunk Cost Fallacy**.
