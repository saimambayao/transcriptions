**Why You Shouldn’t Start with an MVP**

**Introduction: The Pitfalls of the Traditional MVP**

**00:00**
Early-stage founders are often told to quickly build and launch the first version of their product, also known as the Minimum Viable Product, and then iterate from there. In this video, I'm going to explain why this approach no longer works and what to do instead.

**00:14**
Hi there, if you're new to this channel, my name is Ash Maurya. I'm an entrepreneur and author and the creator of the one-page business modeling tool, Lean Canvas. On this channel, I share systematic strategies and techniques for starting and growing a business.

**Defining the MVP**

**00:30**
So let's get into it. Why not start with an MVP? First, I'd like to warn you that MVP is an overloaded term with many different definitions. Some people define an MVP as the first iteration of a working product, while others define it more loosely as anything that helps you learn from customers, which could include things like prototypes and landing pages.

**00:47**
I subscribe to the more strict MVP as the first iteration of a working product definition, which is what I'm going to use in this video. But as you'll see shortly, my advice for not starting with an MVP applies equally just the same to all these other definitions.

**The Premise of the MVP Approach**

**01:02**
The premise behind starting with an MVP is to avoid wasting precious months or years building a perfect product at the risk of building a much larger product that nobody wants.

**01:12**
The logic goes something like this: rush to build and launch something quickly, and then use customer feedback to iterate and refine from there. So what's wrong with this approach?

**Why the MVP Approach is Outdated**

**01:21**
This approach used to work at a time when barriers to entry were higher and customers had fewer product choices. Going back a decade, you could afford to give customers a half-baked alpha or beta and then iterate with them to create something better. 

**01:35**
But this no longer works. It no longer works because the cost of building new products is at an all-time low, which means that customers today have many more product choices competing for the same job. 

**01:46**
When they encounter a half-baked MVP that doesn't immediately deliver value, they don't turn into early adopters or beta customers. They ghost you and switch to another product entirely.

**The Build Trap and Resource Depletion**

**01:57**
Without direct customer feedback, you're left guessing at how to fix your MVP. You try one feature after another in search of the mythical killer feature, which after a while feels like throwing spaghetti on the wall to see what sticks.

**02:10**
Now sure, if you throw enough spaghetti on the wall, you can sometimes get lucky, and you've probably heard of stories like Groupon that brute-forced their way to an idea that worked. But for every one of these stories, there are far more startups that simply ran out of resources.

**Identifying the Real Reason for Product Failure**

**02:27**
The top reason why products fail is building something nobody wants. More specifically, building a product that doesn't solve a big enough customer problem. 

**02:37**
It follows then that the first thing you should start testing is nailing whether you have identified the right customer problem to solve.

**The Solution: Demo, Sell, Build**

**02:43**
The best way to do this isn't by building a working product, but a demo. Think "demo, sell, build" versus "build, demo, sell." 

**02:52**
Here's how it works. Most people start with building a product first, then demo it to make a sale. This is where they get stuck. 

**03:01**
If you think about the steps a little more carefully, you'll realize that customers don't really buy a working product; they buy a demo or a promise of something better. A demo serves as the perfect proxy or stand-in for your product, and it's a much better place to start. If you can't sell the demo, why build the product?

**Real-World Application of Demo-Sell-Build**

**03:17**
Now, if you've ever funded a crowdfunding campaign or placed a preorder for a product, that was "demo, sell, build" at work. 

**03:23**
And before you dismiss this as just a tactic that could only work for simple B2C products, the more complex the sale, the more demos play a role in the buying process before the pilot.

**Testing Assumptions via the Offer**

**03:34**
We can take this even a step further. When you package a demo into an offer—like say, on a landing page or a product pitch—you get to test three of the riskiest assumptions in any business model.

**03:44**
1. **Unique Value Proposition (UVP):** Or promise of better. In other words, are you solving a big enough problem that earns the attention of your prospects?
2. **Solution:** Does your approach to solving this problem resonate with your prospects?
3. **Pricing Model:** Will your customers pay you enough to solve this problem?

**The Offer Trap and the Need for Better Insights**

**04:06**
While starting with a demo is much cheaper and faster than an MVP, like first MVPs, most first demos also typically fall flat because you're often still guessing at what you think customers want. 

**04:18**
You only get a few chances to pitch customers before they get impatient and move on. And if you're delivering your offer on a landing page, it's easy to fall into the "offer trap."

**04:27**
This is where you rely on analytics and metrics to tell you what's going on, but metrics can often only tell you what you already know—that no one is buying—but they don't tell you why. 

**04:39**
Again, without direct customer feedback, you're left guessing, this time on how to fix your landing page. Do you fix the headline, the copy, the pricing model, or something else entirely? Each AB test you run consumes more time and traffic, and weeks quickly turn into months. This is also not the most optimal way to get to something that works.

**Problem Discovery Conversations**

**05:00**
The key to building better demos and MVPs lies in uncovering better customer problem insights. The way to get to better problem insights isn't through better demos, but through better customer discovery conversations. 

**05:13**
Your objective in these conversations isn't to pitch your solution, but to deeply understand your customer's problems and identify possible root causes.

**05:22**
Now this may sound strange, but when you deeply focus on studying your customers, you can often understand their problems better than they do. This is because your customers are too busy firefighting to study their own problems. There's a reason people hire therapists and coaches to uncover deeply rooted issues; uncovering customer problems is no different.

**The Efficiency of Customer Discovery**

**05:41**
Contrary to popular belief, you don't need to conduct 600 surveys or run a hundred customer interviews to uncover these insights. With the right problem discovery process, you can get there with just 20 to 30 interviews, which is well worth the effort.

**Two Superpowers of Deep Customer Understanding**

**05:55**
When you deeply understand your customers better than they do, you gain two superpowers.

**06:00**
The first superpower is that designing the right solution becomes a whole lot easier. "A problem well understood is half solved," as Charles Kettering said. 

**06:07**
When this happens, it's critical to still resist the urge to start building an MVP because your solution, while important, is still only one part of a working business model.

**06:17**
Following the demo-sell-build process, your next step is to turn your solution design into a demo and assemble an offer. This is where the second superpower kicks in. When you can describe your customer's problems better than they can, pitching your solution becomes a whole lot easier. They start viewing you as the expert and think that you surely must also have the right solution for them.

**The Mafia Offer and Achieving Fit**

**06:38**
Marketer Jay Abraham calls this phenomenon "the strategy of pre-eminence," and you've probably experienced it at the doctor's office when you excitedly follow the doctor's prescription after they accurately diagnose your symptoms.

**06:50**
When these two superpowers come together, you don't just end up with an offer, but a "Mafia Offer." A Mafia Offer is a term I coined after the movie *The Godfather*. It's an offer your customers cannot refuse, not because you strong-armed them, but because your solution solves your customer's problems exactly.

**07:08**
This is the step in the process where the rubber hits the road. If you can't get enough people to buy your offer, you don't get to build your MVP until you fix your offer. 

**07:16**
On the other hand, if and when you do get enough people to buy your offer, not only do you know exactly what to build, but you go from hoping people will buy your MVP to knowing they will, which greatly multiplies your odds of success.

**The Traction Roadmap**

**07:30**
So how do you know how many people are enough? This comes from your traction roadmap, which is an artifact from your business model design blueprint that I've covered before. I'll link some resources for that in the description below.

### **Organized Notes**

#### **Key Concepts & Definitions**
*   **[00:30] Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** Ash Maurya uses the strict definition: the first iteration of a working product.
*   **[01:57] The Build Trap:** A cycle where founders build feature after feature without real feedback, essentially guessing what might work.
*   **[06:50] The Mafia Offer:** An offer so perfectly aligned with a customer’s needs that they cannot refuse it.
*   **[06:38] Strategy of Pre-eminence:** Establishing yourself as an expert by diagnosing the customer’s problem more accurately than they can themselves.

#### **The Problem with "Build, Demo, Sell"**
*   **[01:21] Market Change:** A decade ago, customers accepted "half-baked" betas because there were fewer choices. Today, the cost of building is low, leading to high competition.
*   **[01:46] Customer Ghosting:** Modern customers don’t provide feedback on mediocre MVPs; they simply switch to a competitor.
*   **[02:10] Resource Exhaustion:** Most startups fail not because they lacked a product, but because they ran out of time/money while guessing at features.

#### **The "Demo, Sell, Build" Framework**
*   **[02:43] Shift in Strategy:** Start with a demo and secure a "sale" (commitment) before writing code.
*   **[03:01] Proxy for Product:** Customers buy the *promise* of a better future, which a demo can communicate just as effectively as a full product.
*   **[03:34] Testing the Three Riskiest Assumptions:**
    *   **Value Proposition:** Is the problem worth solving?
    *   **Solution:** Does the approach resonate?
    *   **Price:** Will they pay enough to make it viable?

#### **How to Execute Customer Discovery**
*   **[05:00] Focus on Problems, Not Pitches:** Use discovery conversations to find root causes of customer pain.
*   **[05:22] The Therapist Approach:** Study the customer so deeply that you understand their problem better than they do (overcoming their "firefighting" bias).
*   **[05:41] Sample Size:** You only need **20 to 30** high-quality interviews to gain significant insight.

#### **The Path to Problem/Solution Fit**
*   **[06:00] Solution Design:** A well-understood problem is easier to solve.
*   **[06:26] Expert Authority:** Demonstrating deep problem knowledge builds instant trust with prospects.
*   **[07:16] Guaranteed Success:** Moving from *hoping* people buy to *knowing* they will because they’ve already committed to the offer.
