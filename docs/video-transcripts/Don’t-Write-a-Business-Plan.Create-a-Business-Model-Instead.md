**The Trap of the Traditional Business Plan**

**00:00**
When trying to get a new idea approved, you're often asked to write a 60-page business plan or build a business case, complete with a five-year financial forecast and an 18-month product roadmap.

**00:11**
However, much of this information needed to build an accurate plan is simply unknowable at this stage. And you end up writing a completely fictional novel.

**00:19**
This is why many startup founders completely forgo the business planning process entirely, but this isn't any better.

**00:26**
So in this video, I'm going to show you a faster and simpler way to do business planning so you spend more time building versus planning your business.

**About Ash Maurya**

**00:34**
Hi there, if you're new to this channel, my name is Ash Maurya. I'm an entrepreneur and author and the creator of the one-page business modeling tool Lean Canvas.

**00:43**
On this channel, I share systematic strategies and techniques for starting and growing a business.

**Statistics on Business Plans**

**00:47**
Now, have you ever written a business plan before? Did you enjoy the process? I've posed these two questions to thousands of makers, entrepreneurs, and innovators all over the world, and here's what I found.

**01:00**
Only 30 percent had ever written a business plan, and less than 2 percent enjoyed the process.

**01:05**
I asked the investors and stakeholders in the room if they actually read the entire business plan. Again, less than 2 percent admitted to doing so.

**01:13**
Instead, they preferred a one-page executive summary, a 10-page slide deck, or a 30-second elevator pitch.

**01:20**
So why then are we still forcing people to spend weeks writing a 60-page document that no one reads and it's seldom kept up to date?

**The Issues with Heavyweight Planning**

**01:28**
The problem with traditional business plans is that they are just too heavyweight. They take too long to write, are best guesses at best, but most importantly, they don't even get read.

**The Risk of No Plan: The Zombie Startup**

**01:39**
At the other end of the spectrum, many startup founders completely forgo the business planning process and instead opt for a "just do it" or "wait and see" approach.

**01:48**
But a no-plan alternative isn't any better and often leads to creating a zombie startup that is neither dead nor alive.

**01:56**
These are startups that end up on too small a market with little or no growth potential and then they get stuck.

**02:03**
The good news is that most zombie startups can be completely avoided with a little bit of business planning. But a business plan is the wrong tool for this.

**Business Models over Business Plans**

**02:11**
This is where business models come in. Unlike business plans which attempt to describe a perfect plan, business models assume that a perfect plan is a myth, and they instead help you capture the best snapshot of your idea at the moment.

**02:25**
When you're trying to launch a new and innovative idea under conditions of extreme uncertainty, you don't want static and heavyweight plans, but something a lot more dynamic and lightweight that are quick to create, quick to update, and most importantly, get read.

**The Lean Canvas**

**02:40**
A Lean Canvas is one such model. A Lean Canvas replaces long and boring business plans with a one-page business model that takes just 20 minutes to create and because it fits on a single page, it gets read.

**02:53**
If you've ever written a business plan or created a slide deck for investors, you will immediately recognize most of the building blocks on the Lean Canvas.

**03:01**
I like to think of these building blocks as Lego pieces. When you're first starting out, you learn to assemble these building blocks to create simple models like this one, but with a little bit of practice, you're quickly able to build much more complex models like this one.

**Origins: Lean Canvas vs. Business Model Canvas**

**03:16**
So let's take a deeper dive into these building blocks and start with a short backstory of the Lean Canvas. I created the Lean Canvas in 2009 while I was working on my startup.

**03:26**
Lean Canvas is derived from the Business Model Canvas and if you're wondering what's different, I changed four boxes and added three new sub-boxes.

**03:34**
My goal with the Lean Canvas wasn't to try and create a better Business Model Canvas, but something completely different.

**03:41**
The BMC came out of the academic world and does a great job at describing existing business models, but when you're trying to create something new as in a startup, I found that you need a completely different point of view.

**Actionable Elements for Startups**

**03:54**
For instance, during the early stages of an idea, I found that thinking about customers, problems, and solutions is much more actionable and impactful than thinking about key partners, key activities, or key resources, which matter once an idea is established, but getting there is the riskier story to model out.

**04:12**
This is one reason why more startup founders prefer the Lean Canvas over the Business Model Canvas, but your mileage may vary.

**04:20**
If you're on the fence, I'd recommend using both canvases to model out your idea. Both models offer a huge improvement over business plans and are equally fast to create. Then pick the canvas that best captures how you think.

**The Non-Linear Layout of Ideas**

**04:30**
If you're interested, I've also linked a more extended article down below describing the differences between these two canvases.

**04:40**
But back to the building blocks of the Lean Canvas. I often get asked why aren't they laid out logically?

**04:47**
My first answer is that because I derived it from the Business Model Canvas, I wanted to preserve the overall shape and keep as many original boxes as possible.

**04:56**
A better answer though is that ideas don't start logically but as flashes of inspiration. These flashes of inspiration could technically start in any one of these boxes.

**05:06**
For instance, many ideas are inspired by the introduction of some new technology. This is currently happening with AI. These ideas start in the solution box. From there you might then explore what problems you can solve with this new solution and who are most affected.

**05:21**
Or you might start with a personal pet peeve or problem you deemed worth solving. These are "scratch your own itch" ideas that start in the problem box. From there you might identify who's again most affected and then formulate a compelling solution.

**05:36**
Larger companies often start in the unfair advantage box. They might have an exclusive resource like a patent or an invention that they want to commercialize and bring to market. From there they might explore customers or problems and then start defining solutions and unique value propositions.

**Assembling the Business Model Jigsaw**

**05:52**
So for all these reasons, I actually find the somewhat haphazard layout of the Lean Canvas to be a lot better and more helpful because it doesn't pigeonhole you into just one way to think of your idea.

**06:04**
Ideas are like jigsaw puzzles. It doesn't matter which piece you start with as long as you assemble a coherent picture at the end. A Lean Canvas is no different.

**06:14**
That said, even with jigsaw puzzles, we often solve them by grouping certain pieces together. The same is also true with the Lean Canvas. Certain boxes come together to offer a specific point of view which can help make the business modeling process a lot more effective.

**06:30**
I'll present one way that I use a lot based on this definition of a business model by Saul Kaplan.

**06:36**
A business model is a story of how a company or product creates, delivers, and captures value from its users and customers. In case you're wondering what I mean by capturing value, that's just a fancy way of saying how your business model makes money.

**Mapping Jobs to Canvas Boxes**

**06:50**
Let's see how these three jobs are mapped onto the Lean Canvas. You create value with your unique value proposition or UVP.

**06:59**
In order to craft a compelling unique value proposition, you need to deeply understand your customer segments and their problems.

**07:06**
You deliver your value through your solution and channels.

**07:10**
And finally, capturing value or getting paid lies at the intersection of your cost structure and revenue streams.

**07:16**
These three jobs also come together to help you describe a working business model. If you can create more value for your customers than you capture from them through your pricing model, then you create a compelling value proposition. This is the value equation.

**07:32**
And if you can capture more value from your customers than the cost to deliver that value, then you have a sustainable or profitable business model. This is the monetization equation.

**Measuring and Defending Value**

**07:41**
But you'll notice that there are two boxes here that we haven't yet covered. The Lean Canvas also helps you describe two bonus essential jobs in a business model: measuring value and defending value.

**07:52**
You measure the output of a working business model using the key metrics box.

**07:57**
And finally, once your model starts to work, it will inevitably attract copycats and competitors. You deter those copycats and competitors using the unfair advantage box.

**08:08**
And there you have it. This is how you take a big idea in your head and deconstruct it into a set of key assumptions that you can then start weaving into a business model story.

**08:22**
When creating your snapshot, remember that perfection isn't the goal, but taking a snapshot. Getting others to see what you see is the first battle. You'll have ample time to refine and test your big idea from there.

### **Organized Notes**

**I. The Failure of Traditional Business Plans**
*   **Timestamp: 00:00 - 01:28**
*   Traditional plans are often 60+ pages with 5-year forecasts and 18-month roadmaps.
*   **The Issues:**
    *   Most information at the early stage is "unknowable," making the plan fictional.
    *   They are too "heavyweight" and take too long to write.
    *   **Low Engagement:** Research shows only 30% of founders write them, and less than 2% of investors actually read them in full. Investors prefer 1-page summaries or short pitch decks.

**II. The Danger of "No Plan" (Zombie Startups)**
*   **Timestamp: 01:39 - 02:03**
*   Founders often skip planning for a "just do it" approach.
*   **Result:** This often leads to a **Zombie Startup**—a company that is stuck in a market too small for growth, neither fully alive nor dead.

**III. Introduction to the Lean Canvas**
*   **Timestamp: 02:11 - 03:15**
*   **Business Model vs. Business Plan:** A business model assumes the "perfect plan" is a myth and focuses on a dynamic, lightweight snapshot of the idea.
*   **Lean Canvas:** A 1-page model that takes ~20 minutes to create. It is designed to be quick to update and easy for others to read.

**IV. Origins and Comparison (Lean Canvas vs. BMC)**
*   **Timestamp: 03:16 - 04:30**
*   Created by Ash Maurya in 2009, derived from the **Business Model Canvas (BMC)**.
*   **Key Differences:**
    *   BMC is academic/descriptive for existing businesses.
    *   Lean Canvas is for startups; it replaces "Key Partners/Activities/Resources" with "Problem/Solution/Key Metrics" to focus on early-stage risks.

**V. The Layout and Idea Genesis**
*   **Timestamp: 04:40 - 06:14**
*   The layout is non-linear because ideas don't start logically; they start as "flashes of inspiration."
*   **Common Starting Points:**
    *   **Solution box:** Inspired by new tech (e.g., AI).
    *   **Problem box:** "Scratch your own itch" ideas based on personal pain points.
    *   **Unfair Advantage box:** Leveraging an exclusive resource like a patent.

**VI. The Core Definition of a Business Model**
*   **Timestamp: 06:36 - 08:08**
*   A business model is a story of how a company **Creates, Delivers, and Captures** value.
*   **Job Mapping on Lean Canvas:**
    *   **Create Value:** Unique Value Proposition (deeply linked to Problems/Customers).
    *   **Deliver Value:** Solution and Channels.
    *   **Capture Value:** Cost Structure and Revenue Streams (getting paid).
    *   **Sustainable Model:** If Capture Value > Deliver Value (Profit).
    *   **Bonus Jobs:** Measuring Value (Key Metrics) and Defending Value (Unfair Advantage).
