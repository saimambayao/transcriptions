**How to Craft a Powerful Vision Statement**

**The Pitfall of Product-First Thinking**

**00:00**
When entrepreneurs get hit with an idea, too many founders make the mistake of rushing up this vision, strategy, and product pyramid, only to prematurely fall in love with their product.

**00:10**
This is the classic build-first or product-first approach, where the tendency is to lead with what you are building, instead of taking the requisite time to first get your vision and strategy in order. 

**Vision and Strategy: The Foundation**

**00:20**
Vision and strategy are foundational layers, without which even a good product cannot withstand the weight of its market and can come crumbling down. 

**00:29**
But how do you build a simple, yet powerful vision statement that defines your mission, aligns your team, and shapes your strategy? That's what I'm going to cover in this video. 

**Meet Ash Maurya**

**00:39**
Hi there, if you're new to this channel, my name is Ash Maurya. I'm an entrepreneur and author, and the creator of the popular one-page business modeling tool, Lean Canvas. On this channel, I share systematic strategies and techniques for starting and growing a business. 

**Defining the Job of a Vision Statement**

**00:53**
So let me start by defining the job of a good vision statement. A good vision statement starts with communicating your "Why."

**The Golden Circle**

**01:00**
Maybe you've come across this talk from Simon Sinek on the Golden Circle. In this talk, he made a case for how great leaders communicate differently. They lead with their "Why" or purpose, then describe their "How" or unique value proposition, and finally describe what they do—their products. 

**The Apple Case Study**

**01:18**
He opens the talk by asking: why is Apple so innovative? Why are we perfectly okay buying an MP3 player from them, but not from Dell? Both are computer companies with access to similar resources, talent, and media. 

**01:31**
This talk was delivered after Apple released their first outlier product, the iPod, which is where the MP3 player question comes from. It was so different from their other laptop and desktop products that it led them to drop the word "Computer" from their name, opening the way for Apple to transcend category over the next few years. 

**01:51**
Today you can extend this same question to ask: why are we perfectly okay with buying smartphones, tablets, watches, and smart speakers from Apple in addition to computers? 

**The Power of "Why"**

**02:01**
The reason is that Apple communicates differently. They lead with why they do what they do, versus just talking about what they do. Simply by reversing the order of how they present their Golden Circle, Apple is able to inspire action both inside and outside the company. 

**The Vision-Strategy-Product Connection**

**02:19**
Now, even though the Simon Sinek talk was on how great leaders communicate, I find that the Golden Circle is just as applicable to how founders should think of their startups, and it maps perfectly to the vision-strategy-product pyramid. 

**02:34**
Vision maps to your "Why," strategy to your "How," and product to your "What." So before rushing to what you're going to build, start with your "Why."

**What Does a Good Vision Statement Look Like?**

**02:43**
So what does a good vision statement look like? A quick online search will reveal a list like this one. A good vision statement should be:
1. An inspirational vision of the future.
2. It should be focused on a common goal.
3. And it should reflect your core values. 

**The MBA Mission Statement Trap**

**02:58**
The problem is that when you attempt to fit all this into one statement, you easily end up with a bland and generic 50-to-60-word MBA-like mission statement that sounds like this: "The mission of (insert any company here) is to deliver superior quality products and services for our customers and communities through leadership, innovation, and partnerships (blah blah)..."

**The Guy Kawasaki Mantra**

**03:20**
Guy Kawasaki makes a strong case for ditching this MBA mission statement and instead opt for a three-to-five-word mission that serves like a mantra and creates meaning. 

**Iconic Mantras**

**03:34**
Here are some iconic examples:
*   "Organizing the world's information" from Google.
*   "Accelerating the transition to sustainable energy" from Tesla.
*   "Authentic athletic performance" from Nike. 

**Tagline vs. Vision**

**03:45**
I know that when most people think of Nike, they probably think "Just Do It." That's their tagline, which is different but related to a vision statement. 

**03:53**
With Apple, "Think Different" might come to mind, which I'll get to a little bit later also, but Apple's early mission statement was really around democratizing access to technology. Both Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were driven to use innovation to empower people through technology and make a positive impact on society. 

**Clear, Concise, Meaningful**

**04:16**
Notice how none of these sound like they came from a corporate mission statement generator. They're clear, concise, and create meaning. More importantly, they all start with "Why." 

**How to Craft a Powerful Vision Statement**

**04:27**
Now, I'm guessing that you have probably seen these examples before and maybe even struggled to create something as memorable for your own startup. I know that I certainly have. And so in the next section, I'll show you how to break this down into three manageable steps, and I'll use these three steps to show you how I created a vision statement for my company, LEANSTACK.

**Step 1: Who is it for?**

**04:48**
Before you start with "Why," I find it super-focusing to start with "Who." You have to get razor-focused on who, or more specifically, who it's for. 

**Focus on the Hero**

**04:59**
Because when you try to address everyone, you end up addressing no one. For Nike, their "Who" is athletes. Everything they do is in the service of helping create better athletes. Your "Who" is the hero in your startup story. 

**The Nike Inspiration for Apple**

**05:12**
In fact, Steve Jobs was so inspired by Nike's ads and positioning, where they never compared themselves to other shoe companies like Reebok and instead always honored great athletes, that it led him to launch their own famous "Think Different" campaign, where they made their "Who" creatives who change the world—or as he referred to them, the crazy ones. 

**The Mantra Prompt**

**05:32**
A good prompt for finding your "Who" is applying the following to your startup: "Don't build a better (x); build a better user of (x)." 

**05:41**
For Nike, that's build better athletes. For Apple, that's build better creatives. I used this prompt to find the right "Who" for my startup as well. 

**Ash's Discovery for LEANSTACK**

**05:49**
Like many entrepreneurs, I too had rushed up the product pyramid, and after a few false starts and pivots, I finally discovered my "Who" as entrepreneurs, and more specifically, startup founders. 

**A Mission Shift**

**06:01**
The mission or reason for being shifted from just being around building cool and awesome products to building better startup founders. And that single mindset shift not only clarified my mission, but it completely changed my trajectory as a startup founder. 

**Defining Who it's NOT For**

**06:21**
Now, I'm sure you can probably appreciate the focusing power of identifying your "Who," but it's just as important to identify who it's *not* for. For example, at LEANSTACK, we focus exclusively on putting founders first—not investors, not service providers, and not even advertisers—only founders. 

**06:41**
So whenever we're confronted with a new feature or product idea, or even a sponsorship campaign for this channel, we always ask: "Will this help or distract us from making better founders?" If it doesn't help, we just don't do it. 

**Step 2: How is value created?**

**06:54**
Once you have your "Who," the next step is identifying the value-creating action your "Who" or hero takes in their journey of getting better. 

**The Verb in Your Mantra**

**07:02**
This becomes the verb in your mantra: "Athletes perform" in the case of Nike; "Creatives make or create stuff" in the case of Apple. 

**Defining "Better"**

**07:11**
Think of this as further defining what better means for your customers. What makes a better athlete? In the case of Nike, that's performance. This is how Nike, for instance, arrived at "Authentic athletic performance." 

**Achieving Goals vs. Removing Obstacles**

**07:24**
When crafting your own value-creating action, you can either choose to focus on helping your customers achieve their goal or removing obstacles standing in the way of their goal. "Authentic athletic performance" is an example of helping athletes achieve their goal. 

**The Mission of Success**

**07:38**
For LEANSTACK, I chose instead on removing obstacles for my customers. Founders start companies, but they do so under dismal odds of success: 9 out of 10 startups fail. 

**07:51**
And so I chose our mission to be: "Helping startup founders succeed." 

**Democratizing Entrepreneurship**

**07:56**
A few years in my journey, I also realized that founders are no longer limited to just starting in Silicon Valley or some other startup hotspot. Founders are everywhere. And so I evolved this statement to: "Helping startup founders everywhere succeed." 

**08:10**
And even more recently, I shortened this even further to: "Democratizing entrepreneurship." It's simple, meaningful, and I'll get to measurable in the next section. 

**Vision as a Foundation**

**08:20**
But more importantly, it serves as our foundation—every product decision, every strategy, every feature flows from this vision statement. 

**Draft and Iterate**

**08:29**
I share this story to highlight that your vision statement can and will change over time, and that's perfectly okay. You don't need to worry about getting it perfect—start with a first draft and iterate from there. Even "create better startup founders" is a perfectly good first draft. 

**Step 3: Define Your Success Metric**

**08:45**
The final step is identifying your North Star metric or key traction metric that you're going to measure. 

**Measurable Mantras**

**08:52**
This step helps you ballpark how you will know that you're creating enough better athletes or creatives or founders or whoever the hero is in your startup story. While a mantra creates meaning, it should also be measurable, or its meaning loses value over time. 

**The Singular Compass**

**09:07**
My recommendation here is picking not five ways but just one way to measure it. This one traction metric serves as your singular North Star compass, guiding your journey. 

**The Pitfall of Vague or Extreme Goals**

**09:17**
This is where I find most people go wrong. They either don't set any clear goals or try to set overly ambitious and fictional 10-year goals when they can barely see 6 months ahead. 

**Minimum Success Criteria (MSC)**

**09:29**
This is why I instead recommend starting with your Minimum Success Criteria. The Minimum Success Criteria is the smallest outcome that would deem your mission a success, just 3 years from now. 

**Realistic and Ambitious**

**09:44**
The power of the Minimum Success Criteria is that it helps you start small and adjust from there. Think of the Minimum Success Criteria as the smallest, not largest, outcome that would create meaning for you. Then 10x that number to create a worthwhile destination. 

**10:00**
This gives you both a realistic starting point and an ambitious stretch goal or target to strive for. 

**Ash's MSC for Running Lean**

**10:06**
For instance, when I was first considering writing my book *Running Lean* as a side project before there was even a company behind it, I set my Minimum Success Criteria as being able to sell 100,000 books in the first 3 years, and then 10xing that number to reach my stretch or impact goal of 1 million founders. 

**Evolving Goals**

**10:25**
A few years ago, we crossed the 1 million founders impact mark, and so I 10xed that goal to 10 million founders. Remember that no one ever faults you for revising your goals upwards if and when it's warranted. 

**Vision Shapes Strategy**

**10:37**
Having a clear goal makes the mission more concrete, which in turn shapes your "How" and defines your "What." In other words, it shapes your strategy and defines the products you build, all in service of the mission. 

**LEANSTACK's Complete Pyramid**

**10:50**
This is what our complete vision, strategy, product pyramid looks like: 
*   **Vision:** Democratizing entrepreneurship or helping create more successful founders everywhere. 
*   **Strategy:** Practice Trumps Theory. Simple and practical startup playbooks that help turn the often chaotic startup journey into something more manageable and systematic. 
*   **Product:** Tools, Content, and Coaching resources—books, courses, workshops. 

**Closing and Call to Action**

**11:15**
In all fairness, I didn't sketch this visual in one sitting. Most ideas start with a little spark—maybe we see a problem that needs to be solved or we get inspired with a solution idea. But before rushing up the pyramid and getting lost in the product world where weeks can quickly turn into months or years, I would highly recommend creating space to even roughly craft a starting vision statement. 

**11:38**
I recommend starting with who's it for, then defining your unique value proposition and figure out product details from there. A good exercise for distilling clarity around your big idea is sketching a one-page Lean Canvas. It takes less than 20 minutes to do, and you can create one for free at leancanvas.com. 

**11:58**
Thanks for watching, and until next time, take care.

### **Organized Notes**

**Core Framework: The Vision-Strategy-Product Pyramid** **[00:01]**
*   **Vision (Why):** The purpose and mission. **[02:34]**
*   **Strategy (How):** The unique value proposition and how you deliver value.
*   **Product (What):** The actual features and items built.

**The Golden Circle (Simon Sinek)** **[01:00]**
*   **Concept:** Great leaders communicate by starting with "Why."
*   **Apple Case Study [01:18]:** Apple succeeds in multiple categories (iPod, iPhone, Apple Watch) because they lead with a purpose (democratizing tech) rather than just being a "computer company."

**The Vision Statement vs. The Mantra** **[03:20]**
*   **Guy Kawasaki’s Advice:** Ditch long, generic "MBA" mission statements.
*   **Mantra:** A 3-to-5-word statement that creates meaning.
    *   *Google:* "Organizing the world's information."
    *   *Tesla:* "Accelerating the transition to sustainable energy."
    *   *Nike:* "Authentic athletic performance." **[03:34]**
*   **Mantra vs. Tagline [03:45]:** A vision statement is internal purpose; a tagline (e.g., Nike's "Just Do It") is for marketing.

**3 Steps to Craft Your Vision** **[04:36]**
1.  **Identify the "Who" (The Hero) [04:48]**
    *   Don't build for everyone; build for a specific hero.
    *   Prompt: "Don't build a better product; build a better user of that product." **[05:32]**
2.  **Define the Value-Creating Action [06:54]**
    *   Find the verb for your mantra (e.g., Athletes *perform*).
    *   Choose between *helping achieve a goal* or *removing an obstacle*. **[07:23]**
3.  **Define the Success Metric (The North Star) [08:45]**
    *   Pick one singular metric to measure progress. **[09:07]**
    *   **Minimum Success Criteria (MSC) [09:29]:** The smallest outcome needed in 3 years to consider the project a success. 
    *   **The 10x Goal [09:44]:** Use the MSC as a realistic floor and 10x it for an ambitious stretch target.

**Key Mindset Shifts**
*   **Founder-First focus:** Knowing who your product is *not* for is as important as knowing who it *is* for. **[06:20]**
*   **Draft and Iterate:** Statements evolve. Start with a draft like "Build better startup founders" and refine over time. **[08:29]**
*   **Clarity Tool:** Use a **Lean Canvas** to distill a big idea into a one-page business model in under 20 minutes. **[11:38]**
