**The 10X Product Launch Strategy**

**Intro: The Launch Dilemma**

**00:00**
And so picture this: You have spent months building your product, you have done customer interviews, assembled a waiting list, and built an impressive MVP. But now, not sure which launch strategy to use. Should you go all out with a public launch? Maybe you should do a private beta instead to lower expectation. 

**00:17**
What if I told you that most first-time founders are completely wrong about what makes the successful product launch? Today I'm going to show you the exact 10X product launch strategy I've used across multiple successful product launches, a method that flips the traditional launch playbook on its head. 

**00:34**
The best part is that this approach dramatically reduces your biggest risks while accelerating your path to product market fit. So let's dive in.

**00:43**
Hi there, if you’re new to this channel, my name is Ash Maurya. I’m an entrepreneur and author and the creator of the popular one-page business modeling tool, Lean Canvas, used by millions of founders around the world. I help founders like you systematically tackle the messiest parts of starting up.

**Technical vs. Marketing Concerns**

**00:58**
So I devised this 10X product launch strategy a few years ago when I was about to launch a new and highly technical software product called USERcycle. Now even though this is a software product, I found that the principles behind this launch strategy readily translate to all kinds of other products. 

**01:14**
As this was a highly technical product, the engineer in me was worried about technical or product risks. Things like: do we have enough servers? Will our database hold up? Have we done enough capacity and performance testing?

**01:27**
The marketer in me was worried about pricing and positioning: Can we justify charging for our product straight out of the gate? Do we have the right price? Should we wait to build a few more features first? 

**01:40**
I had briefly considered launching the product with a freemium model but quickly ruled it out for a number of reasons that I cover at great length in this video. You should check out the full video for all my reasons but here were my top three.

**The Case Against Freemium and Beta**

**01:52**
First, offering a free product would attract even more users which would put more pressure, not less, on my technical risk concerns. Number two, a freemium model would defer testing our pricing model which is one of the riskiest assumptions in any business model. 

**02:07**
And finally three, we didn’t have lots of money or a long runway to test this idea. We were a small bootstrapped team and so wanted to prioritize profitability from day one.

**02:18**
Now the other option I considered was doing a private beta, but I’ve always felt that calling something a beta is a cop-out. It feels like you are already making excuses for building a crappy product and are basically saying: "Please Mr. Customer, give my product a try, and if you deem it worthy, then please consider paying for it." 

**02:37**
If you’ve followed a rigorous problem solution fit process and validated that people want to buy your product like we had prior to launch, doing a private beta and not charging felt like going backwards.

**Prioritizing the Right Risks**

**02:49**
As I considered my options, I realized that I was essentially juggling multiple types of risk, which I broke into three buckets. There was technical risk: will the product actually work? Customer risk: will people get value from the product? And market risk: will people buy the product? 

**03:06**
And I had learned over the years that these risks aren’t all created equal. While the engineer in me naturally put technical risk at the top, I had seen numerous products like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter hit technical scaling risks and still manage to overcome them over time without going out of business because they had nailed customer and market risks.

**03:26**
In other words, they had built something people really wanted. Twitter would even put up their now-famous fail whale message when their servers were overloaded, which told users to just wait a little while and try again. More recently OpenAI did the same thing when they got off the scale response to their ChatGPT product. 

**03:45**
We now call these types of technical risk "good problems to have" because they can often be solved with additional time, money, and effort. What you can't solve is building something nobody wants or something nobody wants to pay for.

**04:09**
This is why I would now stack the priority of these risks quite differently for a new product, with customer risks at the very top, then market risks, and finally technical risks. Neither public launches nor private betas would let me address these risks in this order; I needed a way to launch my product in stages and that’s when it hit me. 

**The Hockey Stick Curve**

**04:22**
The answer had been staring me in the face all this time: the hockey stick curve. All breakout products follow a hockey stick trajectory where they start out slow during the flat portion of the hockey stick, the curve then gets progressively steeper until it hits an inflection point and then it takes off from there.

**04:45**
This, of course, is not what the founders wanted. Most founders want to skip the flat portion of the hockey stick curve and get to the right-hand side as quickly as possible, which is why they do all-out public launches, but the market dampens their efforts. 

**04:50**
My insight here was to devise a stage-based launch strategy that deliberately followed the hockey stick trajectory, much like a Formula 1 race driver follows a racing line. And that’s how the 10X product launch strategy was born. In the next section, I’ll cover how it works.

**Stage 1: Launching to 10 Customers**

**05:06**
Instead of trying to reach everyone at once with a public launch, the 10X launch strategy deliberately caps the number of customers you allow in using 10X stages. 

**05:17**
In stage one, you launch your product to just 10 customers. Yes, you heard me right: not a hundred, not a thousand, just ten. But these aren’t just any type of customers. Your first batch of customers should be carefully handpicked by you to match your ideal early adopters.

**05:33**
Early adopters are customers with above-average motivation, urgency and desire to use your product. They have no problem with paying for your product if it delivers on value and they happily tell other people about your product when it does. 

**05:47**
How do you find these kinds of ideal early adopters? Through a problem solution fit process. For my product I had spent several weeks running problem discovery interviews to first understand the pain points of my customers.

**06:00**
I then spent several more weeks designing and pitching my product to secure tangible commitments using a demo-sell-build process prior to launch. This is where I learned a ton about my customers and segmented them into different buckets. 

**06:14**
Not all customers have the same sense of urgency or need for a product, and I used a set of qualifying criteria to handpick my best ten. 

**The Concierge Experience**

**06:25**
Because I only needed to support ten customers in stage one, I was able to completely dial down my technical risks and dial up customer and market risks. I did this by charging my early adopters on day one and, in exchange, offering them a high-touch concierge onboarding experience. 

**06:39**
Where we offered to meet with them regularly, help them integrate our solution, and even offered a generous results-based money-back guarantee. 

**07:11**
The logic here was that if we couldn’t deliver value to ten of our most motivated, handpicked early adopters with a high-touch concierge service where we would do everything in our power to help them succeed, how would we be able to deliver value to hundreds or thousands of customers when we were not there?

**07:46**
This is how I traded customer risk and market risk for technical risk at stage one. 

**Stage 2: Grow by 10X**

**08:06**
Now once you’ve validated that your product delivers value to your first ten customers, you are now ready for stage two, where you don’t just add another ten or twenty customers, you challenge yourself to grow by 10X to a hundred customers. 

**08:23**
This non-linear jump forces you to also start thinking non-linearly and play the hockey stick. You make appropriate investments to meet the demands of stage two where you might have to rewire your customer acquisition strategy, customer support and onboarding because you probably can no longer afford to offer the same kind of high-touch concierge service that you did in stage one.

**08:54**
This is how you start dialing up technical risks, but unlike a public launch, which dials it up all the way, you’re doing it in 10X increments. 

**Final Stages and Strategy**

**09:18**
So after stage two with a hundred customers, you aim next for a thousand customers, then ten thousand. How many stages you need is of course dependent on your specific business model. 

**09:28**
So hopefully by now you can see why this 10X product launch approach is so much more effective than conventional launches. It automatically balances the right risks in manageable stages where you get to focus prioritizing the right actions at the right time and ignoring the rest.

**09:44**
For instance, when I’m in stage one or two, losing sleep over server scalability is premature optimization. You’re better off slowing down to help your best customers succeed, which counterintuitively helps you go faster later. 

**09:54**
And if you’re concerned that a 10X product launch will slow you down, that’s a misplaced concern. There is no time limit between these stages, so in theory if you can deliver value to your first ten customers in a day, you get to immediately level up to stage two. And if that’s easy, then move on to stage three.

**The Video Game Analogy**

**10:14**
You can think of these stages like levels in a video game. The goal is to progress through these levels systematically as quickly as you can until you hit some resistance. 

**10:25**
That resistance is typically caused by a constraint in your business model, and when you identify the constraint, you uncover your next obstacle or risky assumption, and breaking the constraint unlocks the next level in the game.

**10:43**
Since my first 10X product launch, I now use this launch strategy across all my products. It’s how I’ve launched books, workshops and yes, even more software products. 

**11:10**
I’ve even built a tool more recently called the Traction Roadmap, which helps you customer-tailor the different stages to your specific product type and business model. 

**11:36**
If you’d like to learn more, I cover this tool in my Business Model Design Challenge course that I’ll link in the description below. Thanks for watching and until next time, take care.


### **Organized Notes**

**Understanding Risk in Product Launches**
*   **[02:49] Three Buckets of Risk:**
    *   **Technical Risk:** Will the product work and scale?
    *   **Customer Risk:** Do people actually get value from the solution?
    *   **Market Risk:** Are people willing to pay for it?
*   **[03:45] "Good Problems to Have":** Technical scaling issues (like those faced by Twitter or OpenAI) are considered "good" because they result from high demand. In contrast, building a product no one wants is a terminal problem.
*   **[04:09] The Strategic Pivot:** Founders should prioritize Customer and Market risk at the very top, deferring full technical scaling until demand is proven.

**The 10X Launch Methodology**
*   **[05:06] Incremental Capping:** Instead of a massive public launch, limit entry to specific stages: 10 customers, then 100, then 1,000, and so on.
*   **[05:17] Stage 1 (The Power of 10):**
    *   Handpick 10 "Early Adopters" who have high urgency and motivation.
    *   **[06:25] Concierge Onboarding:** Use a high-touch approach to ensure these first 10 succeed. If you cannot make 10 highly motivated users happy with direct help, you cannot scale to thousands.
    *   **[07:11] Paid Commitment:** Charge from day one. Validating that people will pay is more important than technical performance in the earliest stage.
*   **[08:06] Stage 2 (Scaling to 100):** 
    *   Shift from a "Concierge" manual process to more automated customer acquisition and support. 
    *   This jump forces non-linear thinking to overcome business model constraints.

**Benefits of the 10X Approach**
*   **[08:54] Avoid Premature Optimization:** Don't waste resources on server scalability until you reach the stage where it is actually necessary.
*   **[10:14] Video Game Analogy:** Progress through stages as fast as possible. When you hit resistance, you have found a business model constraint that needs solving to reach the next level.
*   **[11:10] Versatility:** The strategy applies beyond software to books, workshops, and physical products.
