**Talking Entrepreneurship: Designing Startup Experiments**

**How to Design Startup Experiments**

**00:08**
There are two things that also kind of always puzzled me when reading about Lean Startup and working with companies. One is, kind of what are good indicators that you are on the right path? And the other part is that is kind of the whole, how do you design experiments?

**00:32**
I'm not kind of a big fan of art and thinking about entrepreneurship as an art, but at least if there's any art in it, it's kind of how do you design experiments in order to give you whatever you need in terms of data, information, and stuff like that. 

**00:54**
And I haven't seen from my reading in the whole Lean Startup literature very specific people say, well, what is good experiments? Of course, you have a lot of kind of concrete examples that you do A/B split tests and stuff like that. But if you sit in a specific, do you have kind of a meta frame on how should you design an experiment?

**Applying the Scientific Method to Business**

**01:15**
So that’s a great question and in many ways it leads into a lot of the new work that I’m doing because I precisely get asked this question a lot. And my first attempt at a solution was to just go and study scientists and take the scientific method.

**01:32**
So we talk about things like:
1. Declare outcomes up front.
2. Make sure the hypotheses are falsifiable.
3. So you declare something specific, like I’m going to go run an interview and I’m going to get eight paying customers out of ten interviews. So you make it so it’s very binary; it’s either true or false. 

**01:45**
The other thing is you want to timebox to make sure that we don’t just let experiments run indefinitely because I find that for entrepreneurs, time is the scarcest resource. You can go and find more investors, get more money, you can hire more people, you can get people to work pro bono, but time is one of those things.

**02:04**
If the opportunity moves away from you, you kind of miss that window of market opportunity. So I find that timeboxing is very important. And so I find that there's all of these things where the mechanics of running experiments are somewhat well-defined.

**02:18**
And then also when you go into data measurements analysis, we can use cohort analysis or split tests where, just like a doctor would give one patient the real drug and the other a placebo and we measure whether the drug was really effective or not, we can do the same thing with our customers. 

**02:35**
We’re not going to drug them, but we’re going to give them one version of the product or one version of the pitch and another customer a different one and see if we notice behavior differences.

**Overcoming the Trap of Arbitrary Success Metrics**

**02:44**
I think that some of that is clearly defined, but people still kept asking me saying, I’m doing all these things, but I don’t know how to declare those expected outcomes. Either I don’t have enough data, or no one’s sharing this, like I don’t know what’s a good conversion rate for an iPhone app. 

**02:58**
So what do I put in there? And if I just pick a number, that’s where you run into the trap of, I can play with those numbers and make it so easy that I’ll always succeed.

**03:07**
So if I go to my interviews and I say, okay, I just need ten people to say yes, then I’ll go and talk to people and if I get them to sort of say yes, I can declare that as success. So that’s where I went to saying, well, how do we really quantify these numbers?

**The Difference Between Repetition and Breakthrough Science**

**03:20**
And I went back to the science world and said it can’t just be running experiments. And we have this misguided notion, I feel, of what true science is about. And it goes back to the ninth-grade science class where we all put on small lab coats and we went to the lab and we did all these chemistry experiments or physics experiments.

**03:39**
But we weren’t making breakthrough discoveries. We were repeating someone else's work. So we were going through a series of procedures that were clearly defined and our job was just to make sure we didn’t make a mistake, that we actually got the result that the teacher gave us beforehand. 

**03:52**
So we think science is that way, and that's why some people say entrepreneurship can't be a science because science is just too easy. Well, science is a science, and as Eric says, science is very, very hard. We don't get breakthrough discoveries every day.

**Einstein and the Importance of Mental Models**

**04:04**
So what I found is that if we go and look at some of the breakthrough innovations, a lot of them tend to be accidental. A lot of them tend to have a missing first step. And you look at someone like Albert Einstein; he was a very bad experimental scientist. 

**04:20**
Very early in his career, his mentors told him, quit this profession, go and do something else because you’re not going to be a good experimental scientist. And so he went into the patent office and decided he was going to become a theoretical physicist. 

**04:32**
But once he correctly came up with his theories of relativity, predicted the speed of light before anyone measured it, and then a few years later, for him it was a very good thing because people were able to validate that his theory was actually correct only a few years after he made the prediction.

**04:53**
He then became a celebrated scientist. But he went back and said it wasn’t so much the math and science that I had been using, but really these mental models that I had in my mind.

**05:01**
And so in physics, we talk about the trains moving at the speed of light and shining lights back and forth. But those simple models encapsulated the mysteries of the universe in his head and he could use them to make these breakthrough insights and then scribble math and science and prove some theories out which then got measured.

**System Thinking and Business Modeling**

**05:18**
I find that entrepreneurs need the same models. That before you run experiments, that’s why I’m a big fan of some business modeling. I find that in recent years people have run away from the business plan and have kind of shied away from writing it because no one really reads them.

**05:34**
But we need to do some modeling. Not just of what our idea is, but also of what are the mathematical models behind how customers are going to grow.

**05:43**
So we can model any business. We can look at a viral business like Facebook or a software-as-a-service business, a hardware business, and there's enough analogs, enough models out there that we can begin to draw somewhat predictive models.

**05:58**
Now, as someone once said, "All models are wrong, some are useful." I think the same thing applies here is that not all these models are going to be perfect, but they at least give us that goal which we can then measure against. 

**06:11**
And so we use that model to come up with the predictions we need when we run the experiments. And there are different stages, so we can scale down the model. 

**The Power of Repeatability: The Facebook Example**

**06:16**
And this is where that system thinking comes in because I find that something that's very interesting when you think of the business as a system, there is an aspect of repeatability to it.

**06:25**
And to me, the extreme example is looking at Facebook. So Facebook was able to demonstrate Facebook working with a billion people, but they didn’t have to go to a billion people. They did it just on a few college campuses at first. 

**06:36**
And they had so much repeatability built in that they convinced their investors, "Hey, we know how to do this. We have a system of putting this in a new university and getting 80% of the students online in 30 days and 70% of them loving it so much they're logging in every single day."

**06:52**
It was like clockwork. They had a checklist of things: we do these things and these students behave like we expect them to. They went and repeated the same thing with companies and then convinced their investors, "Hey, this isn't just for students, this can work for anyone." 

**07:05**
And so then they had this huge valuation and us on the outside were saying, "You know, what is Facebook giving these investors to get so much valuation?" But it’s just all that predictability built into the system.

**07:16**
So in your mind, one of the things that you should be looking for is repeatability. And as you say, you may not need a thousand or a hundred thousand to say you can basically start seeing these small signs with a fairly small group of potential customers or pilot projects. 

**07:42**
But you should look for what is repeatable so you don't end up in a model where, well, I basically got ten customers on board but I customized both the story and my product and my service a little bit to all of them. And then you don't have repeatability.

**Modeling Irrational but Predictable Human Behavior**

**07:57**
That’s precisely it. And often times I get some pushback when I use the Einstein example. They say, "Well, Einstein had it easy because he was just trying to model the universe. It was dictated by math and science, so if he cracked the code, he could understand the mysteries. But people are irrational."

**08:12**
So we can't really predict their behavior. But time and time again, if we look at analytics once you go to a certain scale, you begin to see people behaving irrationally but predictably like clockwork. 

**08:24**
So you can actually model that behavior. And there's a great book by Dan Ariely called *Predictably Irrational*, which is all about these experiments he ran on students at MIT.

**08:34**
He's a behavioral economist. So he gave people two choices; one was not in their best interest, but they predictably took that one because it seemed more appealing. But he found that even though they were irrational, they were continuously behaving that same way. 

**08:49**
So again, I would say that customers can be modeled. And if we can model them, we can measure their behavior and then make those corrective actions.

**Using Analogies and Analogues for Breakthrough Insights**

**08:58**
Is there also kind of a way in entrepreneurship to say, well, what are the analogies that we are looking for? Because if you look at Einstein, he has the trains and then he interpreted that into different settings. Could it be a little bit similar in entrepreneurship to say, well, there's an analogy, someone says, well, we use the razor blade model or whatever model that you do?

**09:39**
I think at the specific business model level, and when we even talk about how breakthrough insights happen in science, a lot of it is looking for analogies. So we say Charles Darwin came up with the theory of evolution because he was reading another book by a different Charles, Charles Lyell, which was a theory of how the earth evolved.

**10:00**
So it was a book on geography. But he was reading that on the trip while he was in the islands and that influenced his thinking. So you can almost say that planted that seed. And you see that over and over again. 

**10:09**
Einstein, while he was in the patent office, had the opportunity to read all kinds of scientific papers that were coming to him. So he got what we would call the 10,000 hours of practice, really getting a lot of these ideas in and then coming up with his own breakthrough insights. 

**10:24**
So I think as entrepreneurs too, you see this as well. At least in the U.S., when Walmart was trying to build their store out, it was really a one-person store, now it’s the biggest supermarket in the world. 

**10:37**
But they went and studied their competitors and the innovations; they actually took some of the checkout line innovation from some of their competitors. So they went and studied analogues in their own domains, sometimes in other domains to bring those in, try them out, and if they worked, they worked. 

**10:52**
Google, for example, didn’t invent the auction-based ad system. They actually borrowed it from someone else, ran a test one day and saw they got incredible results, and then that spun their auction-based ad system. So I find that analogues are very powerful.

**The Customer Factory Analogy**

**11:05**
I've been working on one for that meta level. So the way I like to think of the goal of the business model is that I see it as being one of creating customers. And so I look at it as a "Customer Factory."

**11:21**
Ultimately what we're trying to build is a system of products and interconnected marketing and all of these things. They are all subcomponents that once we wire them together, we have this predictable output of customers.

**11:33**
And just like in a factory floor, we can increase throughput, which means we get more customers, which means we get more profit, more revenue. Or we lower them down.

**11:42**
And it's not just a cute metaphor, that's where the system thinking idea kind of got planted. We can apply some of the same techniques we do on the manufacturing floor. 

**12:02**
If we look at the way we wire machines, we find that there's a bottleneck in one machine. If we try to improve all the other machines, we’re not going to improve throughput because everything is getting choked in that one place. 

**12:04**
Similarly with our businesses, if we study them in the same way, we find that at any given point in time, there are usually only a few constraints that hold us back. And if we focus on those, that's where we identify the right things to focus on, the right experiments to run, and we get the maximum output.

### **Organized Notes**

**Foundations of Experiment Design**
*   **[00:08]** Peter Tortensen introduces the challenge of identifying indicators of progress and the "art" of designing experiments.
*   **[01:15]** Ash Maurya applies the **Scientific Method** to startups:
    *   **Declare outcomes upfront:** Define exactly what success looks like.
    *   **Falsifiability:** Hypotheses must be binary (true or false).
    *   **Timeboxing:** Experiments must have a fixed duration because time is the entrepreneur's scarcest resource **[01:45]**.

**The Role of Mental Models and Business Modeling**
*   **[04:04]** Theoretical insights often precede experimental success. Maurya uses Albert Einstein as an example of a "bad experimentalist" who succeeded through superior **mental models**.
*   **[05:34]** Startups should move from static "business plans" to dynamic **business modeling**.
*   **[05:43]** Most businesses can be modeled based on existing analogues (Viral, SaaS, Hardware). 
*   **[05:58]** "All models are wrong, some are useful." Models provide a benchmark to measure experiments against.

**Repeatability and Predictability**
*   **[06:25]** **The Facebook Case:** Facebook proved its massive potential by demonstrating 100% repeatability on small college campuses. They had a "checklist" that resulted in predictable student behavior.
*   **[07:42]** **Warning:** Customizing a product or story for every individual customer destroys repeatability and prevents the model from scaling.
*   **[08:12]** Human behavior, while seemingly irrational, is **predictably irrational** at scale. Startups can model and predict this behavior to make corrective actions **[08:49]**.

**The Use of Analogues and Analogies**
*   **[09:39]** Breakthrough insights often come from cross-domain thinking:
    *   **Charles Darwin** applied geographic evolution theories to biology.
    *   **Walmart** borrowed checkout line innovations from competitors **[10:37]**.
    *   **Google** borrowed its auction-based ad system from others **[10:52]**.

**The "Customer Factory" Framework**
*   **[11:05]** Maurya proposes the **Customer Factory** as a meta-model for business:
    *   Business is a system of interconnected components (product, marketing, etc.) designed to output customers.
    *   **[12:02]** Like a manufacturing floor, startups must identify the **bottleneck** or constraint. Improving parts of the system that are not the bottleneck will not increase overall throughput (revenue/profit).
