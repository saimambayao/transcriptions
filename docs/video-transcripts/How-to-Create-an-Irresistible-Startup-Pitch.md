**How to Pitch Using Audience Worldviews**

**Introduction: The Art of Pitching**

**00:00**
Maybe you've heard this bad lawyer joke: "How can you tell when a lawyer is lying? Their lips are moving." Well, the same is true when it comes to entrepreneurs and pitching. "How can you tell when an entrepreneur is pitching? Their lips are moving."

**00:13**
Pitching is a key skill all entrepreneurs need to learn because you don't just pitch for investment; you pitch to acquire customers, advisors, and even recruit co-founders and team members. 

**The Mistake: One Pitch Fits All**

**00:24**
But the mistake many entrepreneurs make is trying to pitch their ideas the exact same way to everyone. Different audiences share different worldviews and require different types of pitches to get them to see what you see. 

**00:38**
So in this video, I'm going to share the different audience worldviews of a startup, which will help you craft better pitches and secure buy-in from your key stakeholders.

**00:48**
Hi there, if you're new to this channel, my name is Ash Maurya. I'm an entrepreneur and author, and the creator of the one-page business modeling tool Lean Canvas. On this channel, I share systematic strategies and techniques for launching and growing a startup. 

**What is a Worldview?**

**01:02**
So, let’s start with what a worldview is. In his groundbreaking book, *All Marketers Are Liars*, Seth Godin describes a worldview as the set of rules, values, beliefs, and biases people bring to a situation. 

**01:15**
Good marketing is not about changing a person’s worldview, but rather framing your story in terms of their pre-existing worldview. The same is true in entrepreneurship. 

**01:26**
Good entrepreneurship is not about brute-forcing your idea or solution, but rather framing a business model story in terms of your audience’s pre-existing worldview. Your audience in this case comprises of investors, customers, advisors, team members, and even competitors.

**The Entrepreneur's Worldview: The "Awesome" Box**

**01:45**
I’ll illustrate these different worldviews of a startup using a one-page Lean Canvas, which also happens to be a great business model storytelling tool. 

**01:54**
So let’s begin with the story we tell ourselves. When we get hit with an idea, what we see most clearly is the solution or product that we want to build. I show this as the "Awesome" box on the Lean Canvas. 

**02:07**
We spend a disproportionate amount of time discussing the uniqueness of our product features or its underlying technology, and we believe that if only we could bring this solution or product to life, everything else would work itself out.

**The Investor's Worldview: Traction and Returns**

**02:21**
But building a product takes resources. So what keeps us up at night is establishing enough runway in order to bring our solution to life. To do that, you might have to turn to investors. 

**02:33**
But investors don’t really care about your product or solution; they care about one thing: a business model story that promises them a return on their investment within a set timeframe. 

**02:45**
More specifically, this is what they want to know:
1.  How big is the market opportunity? They don't care about who your customers are, but how many. In other words, how big is the market?
2.  Margins: how will you make money? They want to understand the intersection of your cost structure and revenue streams to gauge your profitability and growth potential.
3.  Defensibility: how will you defend against copycats? Because anything worth copying will be copied. What unfair advantages do you possess now or will acquire in the future to deter competition?

**03:18**
But what gets investors' attention above everything else is traction. If you walk into an investor’s office with the beginnings of a hockey stick curve, you’ll trigger a Pavlovian response. They’ll sit you down and try to understand the rest of your business model story. 

**03:32**
So what is traction? Traction is evidence that people other than yourself, your team, and your mom care about your idea. The people that count here, of course, are customers. 

**03:43**
And so traction is nothing more than a measure of your product’s engagement with your customers. Any traction is better than no traction, and so it naturally follows that before trying to win over investors, maybe you should try to win over a few customers first.

**The Customer's Worldview: Problems and Promises**

**03:59**
So how do you do that? What do customers really care about? Customers too don’t care about your product or solution either. They care about the problem or obstacles standing in their way of achieving a desired outcome or getting some job done. 

**04:13**
You probably didn’t wake up today with a burning desire to buy some random app, but if you’ve been struggling with a problem like, say, finding a better or more fulfilling job, you might have signed up for a job listing service that used the headline, "We help you find your dream job in 30 days or we give you your money back." 

**04:31**
This headline is an example of a promise or unique value proposition, and it’s the first thing that customers care about. A good unique value proposition (UVP) doesn't communicate how your solution works, but what using your solution does for your customers. 

**04:47**
Now in order to craft a good unique value proposition, you need to understand who it’s for. While it’s tempting to position your product for everybody, when you try to reach everybody, you reach no one. 

**04:59**
The way you stand out from the crowd isn’t by going broad, but narrow. You do this by focusing not on your broader market, but early adopters, who are a much smaller and highly motivated sub-segment of your overall customer segment. 

**05:13**
The next step here is identifying what problem or obstacle these early adopters are struggling with and anchoring your unique value proposition or promise against that. 

**05:24**
If your promise connects, you now have permission to tell your early adopters about your solution, typically through a demo. 

**05:31**
The art of the demo is showing the smallest thing possible that helps your early adopters visualize how they go from point A, riddled with their problems, to point B, where your solution removes these problems. 

**05:44**
If you can deliver a convincing demo, the only thing left to address is what you want in return. I show this as the value currency exchange captured under revenue streams on a Lean Canvas. 

**05:56**
In a direct business model, this may be a direct money exchange. However, in multi-sided models like an ad-driven product like Facebook or Google Search, this may instead be a derivative currency like attention or data, which is converted to money through a secondary transaction, in this case with advertisers.

**Leading with the Right Lead**

**06:14**
The investor pitch and the customer pitch are the two big business model stories to tackle first. You always want to lead with your strongest foot forward. 

**06:23**
With investors, this starts with a strong traction lead. With customers, this starts with a strong promise or unique value proposition lead.

**The Advisor's Worldview: Learning and Progress**

**06:30**
The next worldview is a bit different. We all need people other than ourselves to guide us in our startup journeys, call our BS, and hold us externally accountable. This is where Advisors come in. 

**06:43**
Good advisors bring a unique worldview to the conversation, but unlike the others, their worldviews are driven by their past experiences, strengths, and interests. 

**06:53**
When faced with an internal startup problem, good ideas can come from anywhere. And so the key here to building a good advisory board is to surround yourself with a diverse set of advisors and be as open and honest with them as possible. 

**07:07**
Practicing "success theater" with them, where you only share good news, may result in a pat on the back, but it misses out on a tremendous learning opportunity. 

**07:16**
Communicating effectively with advisors requires using a learning frame versus a pitching frame, and you can say that this is less of a pitch and more of a transparent, open progress update. 

**07:28**
When talking with advisors, I find it best to provide a quick business model progress update in 5 to 10 minutes, using a Lean Canvas and your metrics as visual storytelling aids. Then I shut up and listen. 

**07:39**
I listen for objections and possible solutions to my problems without getting defensive or trying to change their mind. Now no one has a crystal ball and you alone own your business model. 

**07:48**
Your job isn't to blindly follow all the advice you receive, no matter who it's coming from, but to rigorously test the most promising ideas and make them your own.

**The Competitor Worldview: Unfair Advantages**

**08:02**
There is one more story to cover: the Competitor story. We also have conversations with competitors. These are not your nice sit-downs-over-coffee type conversations. Rather these conversations test your marketing, pricing, and positioning stories in your business model. 

**08:18**
In other words, they test your unfair advantage. I put this one at the end because too many founders prematurely pay attention to their competitors too early. 

**08:27**
This is predicated on the fact that your supposed competition has a clue. What if they are a startup in the early stages like you are and maybe as clueless as you are at the beginning? Simply positioning against the competition guarantees a different approach, but not necessarily the right approach. 

**08:43**
Your true competition then is not determined by who you might think they are, but rather by who your customers think they are. This is something you uncover from your customers or more specifically your early adopters. 

**08:55**
Your true competition is whatever existing alternatives your early adopters are currently using to get the job done that you are now trying to displace. And they belong in the existing alternatives box.

**Conclusion: Startups as Conversations**

**09:08**
So hopefully I’ve convinced you that startups are conversations, and your true job as an entrepreneur is to systematically de-risk your startup through a series of conversations. Each box on the Lean Canvas represents a different facet of risk that you uncover through these conversations or stories. 

**09:26**
Now there are four fundamental pitches or stories every founder should master:
1.  **The Elevator Story Pitch:** This is to provide a 30-second overview of your big idea and get anyone to ask for more. Think of this as the movie trailer for your product.
2.  **The Founder Story Pitch:** Use this to share your origin story and build credibility. Think of this as your personal "why you for this idea" positioning.
3.  **The Customer Story Pitch:** Use this to acquire customers. While the job of the elevator pitch is to earn attention, this pitch is the workhorse that earns trust and turns a prospect into a paying customer.
4.  **The Business Model Story Pitch:** Use this to tell your startup's business model story. Use it to recruit co-founders, attract advisors, and secure investors for your idea.

**10:19**
Now the elevator pitch is the foundational pitch that I recommend everyone start with because all others build upon it. If you'd like to learn how to craft a compelling 30-second elevator pitch, you should check out this video over here. Thanks for watching and until next time, take care.


### **Organized Notes**

**Startup Pitching and Audience Worldviews**

**Introduction to Pitching [00:13]**
*   Pitching is a critical skill for more than just fundraising.
*   Entrepreneurs pitch to acquire customers, advisors, co-founders, and team members.
*   A common mistake is using the same pitch for every audience.

**The Concept of a Worldview [01:02]**
*   **Definition:** A set of rules, values, beliefs, and biases a person brings to a situation.
*   **Strategy:** Effective pitching frames the startup's story within the audience's pre-existing worldview rather than trying to change it.

**Key Audience Worldviews**

*   **The Entrepreneur (Solution-Focused) [01:54]:**
    *   Focuses on the "Awesome" box (product features and technology).
    *   Believes the product's existence will solve all other business model issues.
*   **Investors (Return-Focused) [02:33]:**
    *   Care about market size, profit margins, and defensibility against competition.
    *   **Traction [03:18]:** The most important factor for investors; measurable evidence of customer engagement.
*   **Customers (Problem-Focused) [03:59]:**
    *   Do not care about the product; they care about their own problems and outcomes.
    *   **Unique Value Proposition (UVP) [04:31]:** Focuses on what the product *does* for the customer.
    *   **Early Adopters [04:59]:** Narrow, highly motivated target segments.
*   **Advisors (Learning-Focused) [06:30]:**
    *   Provide guidance and external accountability.
    *   Require a **Learning Frame [07:16]** (transparent progress updates) rather than a Pitching Frame.
*   **Competitors (Market-Focused) [08:02]:**
    *   Competition is defined by what customers currently use (**Existing Alternatives [08:55]**).
    *   Founders should avoid obsessing over competitors too early.

**Four Fundamental Pitch Types [09:26]**

1.  **Elevator Story Pitch:** A 30-second "movie trailer" overview to pique interest.
2.  **Founder Story Pitch:** Credibility-building story explaining why the founder is right for the idea.
3.  **Customer Story Pitch:** The primary tool for building trust and converting leads into sales.
4.  **Business Model Story Pitch:** Comprehensive story used for recruiting and fundraising.

**Core Philosophy [09:08]**
*   Startups are fundamentally a series of conversations aimed at systematically de-risking the business model. Each conversation addresses a specific facet of risk represented by the Lean Canvas.
