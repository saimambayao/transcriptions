**The Risky Business of Pricing**

**Introduction: Pricing is Not a Later Problem**

**00:00**
Pricing is one of the riskiest aspects of any business model, but most founders choose to defer pricing to later. They wait to first build their product, understand their cost structure, and then set pricing with customers. 

**00:12**
This is backwards. Your pricing model should determine your product and not the other way around. And the best time to set your pricing model is a lot sooner than you think. In this video, I’m going to show you how.

**00:24**
Hi there, if you’re new to this channel, my name is Ash Maurya. I’m an entrepreneur and author, and the creator of the one-page business modeling tool Lean Canvas. On this channel, I share systematic strategies and techniques for starting and growing a business.

**The Failure of "Free" Strategies**

**00:37**
A popular strategy when launching a new product is to give it away for free so that you can:
1. Learn from users
2. Get them to try before they buy
3. Then, set pricing based on what users would be willing to pay. 

**00:48**
While sound in theory, things seldom work this way in practice because, one, users are different from customers. While all customers start out as users, not all users go on to become customers.

**01:00**
When you give away your product for free, you will attract more users than customers who tend to drown out the true voice of your customer. It becomes harder to filter customer feedback that you should follow and instead you end up following the vocal majority, which steers you down the wrong path. 

**Pricing as a Positioning Tool**

**01:17**
Next, your pricing model is part of your product and it determines which type of customer you attract. 

**01:24**
Suppose I placed two bottles of water in front of you and tell you that the one on the right costs $0.50 and the other costs $2. Even though you couldn’t tell them apart in a blind taste test, because they are similar enough, you might be inclined to believe or at least wonder if the more expensive water is of higher quality. 

**01:43**
Here price has the power to change your perception of the product. Now more interestingly, the bottled water you pick also determines which customer segment you belong in. 

**01:53**
From the existing market for bottled water, we know that there is a viable business model for bottled water at both price points. So what you charge signals your positioning on which customers you want to attract. 

**02:04**
And finally, it is not the user's job to set pricing. That's your job because your business model and product survival depend on it. Can you imagine Steve Jobs asking customers what they’d be willing to pay for an iPhone or iPad? 

**The Three Approaches to Pricing**

**02:19**
In the next section, I'll cover how to set pricing by first starting with what not to do. 

**02:24**
First, you should completely forget cost-based pricing, which is something a lot of people do by first determining their cost structure and then slapping a margin to set their price. 

**02:35**
This too is backwards because customers don’t care about your solution or cost structure, but rather their problems and outcomes. When buying that iPhone, do you justify pricing by slapping a fair margin on Apple’s unit costs? 

**02:49**
No, of course you don’t. You justify pricing based on your perceived value of what the iPhone will let you do compared to other smartphones and, more importantly, how it makes you feel. 

**03:00**
Value-based pricing is another way of setting pricing and while it's certainly better than cost-based pricing, it's still not enough. 

**03:08**
In value-based pricing, you anchor your pricing against your product's unique value proposition and the cost of similar alternatives. Your product's fair price sits somewhere between these two anchors. 

**03:20**
Now this too isn’t enough because it’s possible to set a fair price for your product but still fail to build a viable business model, and then you get stuck. 

**03:29**
This is why I recommend setting business-model-based pricing before value-based pricing. 

**Three Steps to Business-Model-Based Pricing**

**03:35**
Setting business-model-based pricing is a three-step process. 

**03:38**
Step 1 is where you outline all the ways that you could achieve your business model goal or minimum success criteria. 

**03:46**
You want to avoid starting with your product or idea and instead determine that business model outcome based on your minimum success criteria that you would use to deem any project a success in three years.

**04:06**
The next step is to outline all the ways that you could achieve this outcome. For example, if my goal is to build a $1 million a year business, I would need to achieve one of the following:

*   Acquire 100,000 customers paying you $10/year
*   Acquire 10,000 customers paying you $100/year
*   Acquire 1,000 customers paying you $1,000/year
*   Acquire 100 customers paying you $10,000/year
*   Acquire 10 customers paying you $100,000/year

**04:20**
Notice that this approach is idea agnostic, rather it's goal oriented. When you start thinking this way, you quickly realize that there are only a finite number of ways to build any size of business.

**04:31**
In the second step, you begin to model specific business model variants that could meet that minimum success criteria goal of yours. 

**Case Study: Lean Canvas Business Models**

**04:40**
I’ll illustrate this with a personal example. In 2010, I introduced the one-page business modeling template Lean Canvas in a blog post. Today, the Lean Canvas is used by millions of people around the world.

**04:51**
But going back in time, here are some of the ways I considered building a $1 million business around the Lean Canvas:

*   I could write an ebook on how to use the Lean Canvas and sell 100,000 books per year for $10.
*   I could build a SaaS product and charge 10,000 entrepreneurs $100/year.
*   I could sell an online course for $1,000 to 1,000 students/year.
*   I could sell a mastermind coaching program to 100 people/year for $10,000.
*   I could build an innovation platform and charge $10,000/yr to 100 enterprises.
*   I could offer private consulting to 10 big clients per year for $100,000.

**04:59**
Some of these ideas are more feasible than others, while others are more fitting to the kind of company I wanted to build. Finding fit here is what I call Founder Model Fit, and it's best to find this fit before pursuing product market fit. 

**05:13**
Here is how I prioritized my list of options for myself. Selling 100,000 ebooks a year may sound easy to some of you, but most products like books convert at a very low percentage, 1% at scale. This would require building a huge top-of-the-funnel with 10 million people. While not impossible, it’s certainly not easy!

**05:34**
My goal with my business was to prioritize impact and purpose over profit. While I could potentially charge high consulting fees and build a large consulting company, I didn’t want to limit my expertise to just tens or hundreds of clients a year. These high-priced options didn’t fit my personal founder mission.

**05:52**
And my last constraint came from being a technical founder. I wanted to leverage software in some way versus just using people and time to build out the business. This is how I ended up building an online Lean Canvas tool that grew into LeanStack.

**Final Shortlisting and Testing**

**06:07**
The final step is to shortlist your most promising variants by picking a big enough market that you want to serve. 

**06:15**
Now when you go through an exercise like this, it's perfectly okay and even advisable to end up with a top one to three variant business models. It's a good idea to test these in parallel for a little while to find your one variant, your primary business model. 

**06:30**
When you do, you want to stay razor-focused on that and drive it to product market fit. 

**06:35**
Picking just one variant to focus on is probably the step that most founders struggle with, myself included, because it's so tempting to say yes to anyone who might want to pay you. 

**06:45**
But having five ways of making money at five different price points across different customer segments when you're pre-product market fit is a recipe for spreading your limited resources too thin. 

**06:56**
Embracing a singular product, single price point, and single beachhead customer focus is vital until you hit product market fit. 

**Conclusion: Rapid Viability**

**07:05**
So when do you apply business-model-based pricing to your idea? The ideal time to apply it is at the outset of any new project. The next best time is right now. 

**07:15**
If you haven’t already, administer the rapid viability test on your product. This simple five-minute exercise could save you months of wasted effort and drive a renewed focus on your beachhead customer, problem, and solution. Thanks for watching, and until next time, take care.


### **Organized Notes**

**Core Premise [00:12]**
*   **Pricing-First Strategy:** Don't build first and price later. Your pricing model should dictate the product development.
*   **Customer Selection:** Pricing isn't just about revenue; it signals your positioning and selects the type of customer you attract.

**Traditional Pricing Errors [02:19]**
1.  **Cost-Based Pricing:** Calculating costs and adding a margin.
    *   *Why it fails:* Customers don't care about your overhead; they care about their own problems and outcomes.
2.  **Value-Based Pricing:** Anchoring price to a unique value proposition versus competitors.
    *   *The Limitation:* You can have a "fair" price that still results in an unviable, money-losing business model.

**The Strategy: Business-Model-Based Pricing [03:29]**
A 3-step process to ensure viability before focusing on "fairness."

1.  **Define Minimum Success Criteria (MSC) [03:38]:**
    *   Set a goal for where the business needs to be in 3 years to be considered a success (e.g., $1M in Annual Recurring Revenue).
2.  **Model Business Variants [04:31]:**
    *   Brainstorm different ways to achieve the MSC (e.g., selling to 10 enterprise clients at $100k/yr vs. 100,000 users at $10/yr).
3.  **Founder-Model Fit [05:06]:**
    *   Filter your variants by what fits your personal mission, resources, and strengths (e.g., a technical founder might prefer a SaaS product over a high-touch consulting firm).

**Execution Tips [06:07]**
*   **Singular Focus:** Until you reach Product-Market Fit, focus on **one** product, **one** price point, and **one** beachhead customer segment.
*   **Testing Variants:** It is acceptable to test 1-3 models in parallel initially to find the most viable path.
*   **Immediate Action:** Perform a "Rapid Viability Test" immediately to prevent months of wasted development on an unviable model.
