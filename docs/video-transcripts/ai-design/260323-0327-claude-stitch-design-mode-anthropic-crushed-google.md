## Organized Notes

**The Counter-Argument: You Don't Need Stitch**

- Stitch is good for **quick ideation, mockups, and rough user flows** — paste into Figma and refine
- But if your goal is to **ship real UI in code**, you don't need a separate design canvas
- **Claude Opus 4.6 + a frontend design skill** can produce shippable UI directly in your codebase
- Key difference: Stitch generates static mockups you reimplement later; Opus 4.6 works in **actual code from the start**

**What Good UI Actually Requires**

- Good UI is NOT "make me a dashboard and stare at one generated screen"
- It's: **hierarchy, spacing, typography, responsive behavior, visual restraint, motion, consistency across screens**
- The design must **fit the product**, not look like generic AI slop
- This is where Opus 4.6 shines — it reasons through project structure, existing components, design direction, and product constraints **all at once**

**The Frontend Design Skill as Art Direction**

- The skill acts as an **"art direction layer"** on top of Claude's coding ability
- Biases toward: strong composition, clear hierarchy, sparse copy, real visual anchors
- Pushes against: generic card grids, weak branding, cluttered heroes, sections that all feel the same
- **Do NOT just type "make it look better"** — that gets average results

**The Three-Part Prompt Structure**

1. **Visual thesis** — what should the UI *feel* like? (premium, editorial, technical, playful, calm, dense, sparse)
2. **Content plan** — what are the sections and what does each do? (hero, support section, detail section, CTA)
3. **Interaction thesis** — 2-3 motion ideas that define the feel (staggered hero reveal, sticky scroll, hover transitions)

- Example prompt: *"Build a premium AI coding app landing page. Visual thesis: cinematic, editorial, dark steel with one warm accent. Content plan: full bleed hero, one proof section, one workflow detail, final CTA. Interaction thesis: staggered hero entrance, sticky workflow section, restrained hover reveals. Avoid generic SAS cards. Keep first viewport like a poster."*

**Stable Configuration Rules (Use Every Time)**

- No generic SAS card grid as first impression
- No hero card by default — keep hero **full bleed or visually dominant**
- **At most 2 typefaces**, 1 accent color
- First viewport feels like a **poster, not a document**
- Every section has **one job only**
- Real visual anchors, not random decorative gradients
- **2-3 meaningful motions**, not 10 pointless micro-animations
- Match copy style to context: product language for landing pages, utility copy for dashboards
- Never put homepage marketing fluff inside a product interface

**Verdant Workflow Advantages**

- **Plan mode first** — make Opus 4.6 think through layout, component breakdown, responsive strategy, animation, typography hierarchy before building
- **Iterative refinement in code** — don't throw away and restart; tell it "remove the card treatment, make hero more image-led, reduce copy by 30%"
- **Parallel workspaces** — spin up multiple isolated workspaces for different design directions (editorial vs. startup vs. app aesthetic), compare diffs, merge the best
- Skills marketplace makes activation cleaner than manual setup

**Verdict: Stitch vs. Code-First Design**

- **Stitch**: quick exploration, fast visual directions, lightweight design canvas
- **Opus 4.6 + frontend design skill**: actual shippable code, iterative refinement, works in your real repo
- "The end goal is not to admire a mockup. The end goal is to **build the thing**."
- For real implementation, the code-first approach is more valuable

## Transcript

[00:05] Hi, welcome to another video. So, Google Stitch is obviously getting a lot of attention for making UIs with prompts, images, and now more complete prototyping style workflows. Now, that is cool. I think Stitch is genuinely

[00:18] interesting. If you want fast ideation, quick mockups, rough user flows, or something you can paste into Figma and keep refining there, Stitch makes a lot of sense. But I also think there is another side to this. If your actual

[00:30] goal is not just to get a pretty screenshot, but to ship a really good UI in code, then honestly, you do not necessarily need Stitch for that, you can make really good UIs with just Claude Opus 4.6 in a coding workflow, especially if you pair it with a proper front-end design skill. And if you ask me, the workflow I would mainly use for that right now is Verdant. Why? Because

[00:50] the whole workflow there fits this really well. You can install the front-end design skill, activate it directly in the flow, work in plan first mode, compare different directions in isolated workspaces, and keep iterating in actual code instead of bouncing between mockups and implementation. And this is the key thing that I think many people miss when they talk about AI UI generation. Good UI is not just make me

[01:11] a dashboard and then stare at one generated screen. Good UI is hierarchy, spacing, typography, responsive behavior, visual restraint, motion, consistency across screens, and making the design actually fit the product instead of looking like generic AI slop. That is where Opus 4.6 plus a front-end

[01:27] design skill gets really interesting because instead of generating some isolated design on a canvas and then reimplementing it later, you're already inside the actual codebase. Opus 4.6 and six can reason through the project structure, your existing components, the design direction and the product constraints all at once. Then the

[01:44] front-end design skill acts like an art direction layer on top of that. So let me show you the workflow I would actually use. First I would open the project invertent. Then I would set the

[01:53] model to claude 4.6. After that I would open the skills marketplace, search for the front-end design skill and install it. And this is where the setup gets

[02:01] important. Do not just install the skill and then type make it look better. That is exactly how you get average results.

[02:07] What you want to do is activate the front-end design skill from the input box and then give it proper direction. The skill works best when you tell it three things before building. One is the visual thesis. Basically, what should

[02:18] the UI feel like? Premium, editorial, technical, playful, calm, dense, sparse. Second is the content plan. What are the

[02:26] sections and what is each section supposed to do? Hero, support section, detail section, final CTA, dashboard, workspace, settings panel, whatever fits the product. Third is the interaction thesis. What are the two or three motion

[02:39] ideas that should define the feel? Maybe a staggered hero reveal, a sticky scroll section, and a hover transition that sharpens affordance. This is really important because now Opus 4.6 is not

[02:50] guessing what good UI means. You are giving it an actual design system for the task. For example, inside Verdant, I would write something like this.

[02:58] Use the front-end design skill. Build a premium AI coding app. Landing page, visual thesis, cinematic, editorial, dark steel surfaces with one warm accent, content plan, full bleed hero, one support proof section, one workflow detail section, final CTA, interaction thesis, staggered hero entrance, sticky workflow section, restrained hover reveals. Avoid generic SAS cards. Keep

[03:23] the first viewport like a poster. Use one dominant visual idea per section. That kind of prompt is chef's kiss because the skill itself already pushes the model in the right direction. It

[03:33] biases towards strong composition, clear hierarchy, sparse copy, a real visual anchor, fewer cards, fewer random colors, and more intentional motion. It also pushes against exactly the kinds of failures that ruin AI generated UIs, like generic card grids, weak branding, cluttered heroes, and sections that all feel the same. So this is great for sure. Then I would

[03:58] start in plan mode first. This is another reason I like Verdant for this. Instead of letting the model immediately start throwing code everywhere, I can make Opus 4.6 think through the UI

[04:07] structure first. I would have it plan the page layout, component breakdown, responsive strategy, image usage, animation approach, and typography hierarchy. Once the plan looks good, I approve it and let it build. Now, here's

[04:21] where this gets better than a lot of pure design generation workflows. If I do not like the first result, I do not have to throw away the whole thing and start over from scratch. I can tell Opus 4.6, remove the card treatment, make the

[04:36] hero more imageled, reduce the copy by 30%, use a calmer accent color, make mobile feel tighter and more intentional, the brand is too quiet. Make the product name the loudest text. And because it is working on the real front end, it can actually apply those changes in code rather than just generating another pretty static frame.

[04:56] This is pretty amazing to be honest. And Verdant makes this even stronger because of workspaces and parallel tasks. It also helps that the workflow can nudge you toward polishing the UI with the front-end skill at the right moment instead of you remembering it 3 hours later. So, if I want to compare

[05:13] directions, I can spin up multiple isolated workspaces and ask Opus 4.6 for different interpretations of the same brief. One workspace can go for a restrained editorial direction. Another

[05:25] can go for a brighter startup look. Another can go for a more product heavy app aesthetic. Then I compare the diffs, keep the strongest ideas, and merge what I actually want. That is basically the

[05:35] variance idea, but apply to real front-end code in your actual repo. So in that sense, yes, Stitch is cool for ideiation, but Verdant plus Opus 4.6 plus the front-end design skill feels closer to shipping. And I am not saying

[05:49] Stitch is bad, by the way. Stitch is still useful if you want quick exploration, fast visual directions, or a lightweight design canvas. But if you're already building the app and you care about implementation quality, I think the Opus 4.6 route is a really

[06:03] good option for sure. Now, let me be specific about how I would configure the front-end design skill. In practice, I would give it a few stable rules every time. No generic SAS card grid as the

[06:14] first impression. No hero card by default. Keep the hero full bleed or visually dominant. Use at most two type

[06:20] faces. Use one accent color unless the product already has a strong system. Make the first viewport feel like a poster, not a document. Give every

[06:29] section one job only. Use real visual anchors, not random decorative gradients doing nothing. Add two or three meaningful motions, not 10 pointless micro amin aminations. And then I would

[06:41] also tell it what kind of product copy to use. If it is a landing page, use product language. If it is a dashboard, use utility copy. That matters a lot

[06:50] because one of the easiest ways to make AIUI look fake is when it writes homepage style marketing fluff inside a serious product interface. So that is also something I would configure up front. Now if you do not use Verdant, you can still do something similar in Kilo CLI. In Kilo CLI, I would keep a

[07:08] reusable front-end design prompt or rule file and then run Opus 4.6 against the repo with that guidance. It absolutely can work and Kilo is still a very good terminal first option if that is your preferred workflow. However, it can be a

[07:22] bit more manual. with Verdant the skills marketplace and the ability to activate the skill directly inside the workflow just makes this cleaner and then claude code very briefly can also do this. If you're already living in cloud code you can keep a front-end design skill or rules file there and ask Opus 4.6 to

[07:41] redesign a screen or whole front-end flow that works too. I just think Verdant currently makes the whole install activation and parallel exploration flow more obvious for this specific use case. So what is my verdict on the whole thing? Google was right

[07:57] that people want AI help for making UIs. That is why Stitch exists in the first place. But I think the bigger lesson is this. You do not need a separate AI

[08:06] design canvas to get really good UI anymore. If you have a strong coding agent, a strong model like Claude Opus 4.6 six and a well-designed front-end design skill that gives the model actual art direction, you can get results that are not just pretty, but actually shippable. And if you ask me, that is

[08:23] more valuable because the end goal is not to admire a mockup. The end goal is to build the thing. So, for quick ideation, sure, try Stitch. But for real

[08:33] implementation with actual front-end code, Verdant plus Opus 4.6 plus the front-end design skill is kind of awesome. Overall, it's pretty cool.
