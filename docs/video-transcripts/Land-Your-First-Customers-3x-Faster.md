**The Smart Founder's Shortcut: The Demo-Sell-Build Method**

**Why Traditional Methods Fail**

**00:00**  
When founders get hit with an idea, they often spend weeks or months first building out their product (or MVP), then they line up a number of demos with potential prospects, and then spend several more weeks and months attempting to drive sales. This is the traditional build-demo-sell-build approach that most founders follow, but there's a much better way that I'm going to show you in this video that is three times faster, converts three to five times better, and guarantees that you only build what customers want. So let's dive in.

**00:30**  
Hi there, if you're new to this channel, my name is Ash Maurya. I'm an entrepreneur and author and the creator of the popular one-page business modeling tool Lean Canvas. On this channel, I share systematic strategies and techniques for launching and growing startups. So let me start by describing why a build-first or a build-demo-sell-build approach is not the best approach anymore for launching a new product.

**00:53**  
First, building a product always takes longer than we expect. This is because building anything new has lots of unknowable unknowns. What we initially estimate as little tasks start taking a little longer, and weeks can quickly turn into months, which delays launching and testing of your product.

**01:11**  
Next, it's easy to fall into the scope creep trap once you start building a product where you start coming up with just a few more additional features here and there to complete out your product. This is the over-building trap. Maybe you've seen this project management illustration before where all the customer wanted was a simple tire swing but what they got instead was a roller coaster. But the real danger of a build-first approach is not just over-building but far worse: building the wrong product.

**01:40**  
When you rush to build a product without adequate customer validation, it's easy to go astray and build the wrong product entirely. Unlike the before times where we could launch a product and then learn from customers, customers today have many more product choices than before. When they encounter a half-baked product, they don't stick around to give you feedback; they leave to try out the next product, and you're left on your own guessing how to fix your own product.

**02:06**  
The underlying problem then with taking a build-first approach is that you spend most of the time de-risking technical risks, but that's not what's riskiest with most products today. With the advent of no-code tools and now AI, the real question isn't "Can we build it?" but rather "Should we build it?" or more specifically, "Will anyone care enough to buy it?" And here's the counterintuitive bit: You don't need to first build a working product to answer this question.

**The Demo-Sell-Build Alternative**

**02:35**  
The best way that I've found for answering this question isn't with the traditional build-demo-sell-build approach but using a different demo-sell-build process. With demo-sell-build, you don't start with building a product but a demo of your product that you then try to sell. If you can't sell the demo, why build the product?

**02:54**  
Now when people hear this, they often ask, "Well, don't I need a working product first to build a demo?" and the simple answer is no. The job of a demo is to tell a story of what your product delivers, not demonstrate how it works. And sure, while you can certainly demo a working product, it's just as possible to deliver a demo using:

1. Mockups
2. Screenshots
3. A picture of what your product will look like
4. Or even just a verbal description of what your product will do

**03:22**  
The art of the demo is showing the smallest thing possible to make a sale. Now, thinking you need a working product or prototype to create a demo to make a sale is a common myth in the product world. I see this all the time when I'm working with early-stage founders. In fact, here's a recent conversation I had with one founder.

**Case Study: The Machine Learning Startup**

**03:40**  
I was sitting across from this founder who had done a great job of identifying a real customer problem, and he had a solid technical solution in mind. When I asked him what was keeping them from closing customers, he told me they were waiting to finish their demo. I was curious about the timeline, and he told me it would take them two months. Two months?! When I pressed for details, he explained that they were building a complex machine learning solution and needed a working prototype with the right dataset to show potential customers.

**04:12**  
I asked him if their potential customers had specifically requested a working prototype demonstration, and the founder hesitated at that point and started to say, "Well, no, we haven't really talked to anyone yet, but—" and that's when I cut him off. I suggested that instead of demonstrating a working product, they start with showcasing the promise or unique value proposition their product was going to deliver to their customers. In their case, this boiled down to a single report.

**04:41**  
Their potential customers were currently outsourcing this report to expensive consultants who took weeks to analyze data to create the report and charged them tens of thousands of dollars. The startup's product would not only shrink this time from weeks to hours, but their real value proposition according to the founders was creating a more powerful report with better insights than the current report the consultants were creating. And that was it.

**05:06**  
I told them to treat the report and not their product as the demo. Instead of waiting to finish their product, I asked them to instead create a sample report using real data and then set up a few calls with potential customers where they would share a before and after story.

**The Demo Script Outline**

**05:24**  
Here's the rough outline of the script I shared with them:

1. Start by telling a "before" story of how your potential customers currently hire consultants to generate this report.
2. Make sure to point out how long it takes and how much it costs the customer both in terms of time and money.
3. Then tease a better new way you're working on and tell them why it's different and what it promises: faster and better insights in their case.
4. Pull up the sample report and show them why it's different and better.
5. Then ask them what they think.

**05:55**  
"Well, will that work?" the founder asked me. "What if they don't believe us?" I said, "Well, let's see what happens. If they need more proof, ask them specifically what they'd like to see next and set up a follow-up meeting with them." After a slightly more convincing, the founder agreed to try this approach out.

**06:11**  
The next day, I got a call from him. He had signed up his first paid pilot! When I asked him if they needed to schedule that second meeting with a working demo, the founder just laughed. "That's the best part," he told me. "The customer wasn't interested in wasting time with another demo; they just wanted to see what new insights our product could uncover using their actual data."

**06:32**  
So they proposed we start on a three-month paid pilot right away. When we mentioned it would take us about two months to get that ready, they told us that was already an aggressive timeline—getting the project approved through legal and procurement alone would take about two months, and so their suggestion was we get started right away. They signed a letter of intent and got the ball rolling.

**06:55**  
Now think about that for a moment. The team was planning on waiting two months before even approaching customers with the demo. Instead, by using a demo-first approach focused on outcomes, they not only closed the customer immediately but got the customer to start the process of getting them paid for a pilot while they built out the functionality they were going to build out anyway. This is a perfect example of demo-sell-build versus build-demo-sell.

**Core Principles of Demo-Sell-Build**

**07:21**  
In case you're wondering, the demo-sell-build approach isn't limited to just software or digital products; I've seen it work across hardware, services, B2B, and B2C. While a few tactics change along the way, the principles largely remain the same. So in the next section, I'm going to outline the main principles of demo-sell-build and show you how you can adapt them to different types of products.

**07:45**  
**Principle 1: Customers don’t buy working products but a promise of something better.**  
Communicating better doesn't start with your product's features but your product's promise or Unique Value Proposition (UVP). This is universal across all types of products. The first battle for any product is earning attention, which is the job of your UVP. Think of your UVP as the headline you would use in an ad for your product or a short one-line descriptor you would use in an email to a prospect. A good UVP should either nail your prospect's problem, promise a better outcome, or better yet, do both.

**08:24**  
Once you get a customer to pay attention, the next step is earning trust. That's the job of your demo. Remember, the art of the demo is showing the smallest thing possible to get them to buy.

**08:35**  
Here's a list of different types of demos ranked from low-fidelity to high-fidelity across different product types:

* **Digital Products:** Verbal demo → Screenshots/Mockups → Clickable Prototype → Working Prototype.
* **Physical Products:** Verbal demo → Sketches/CAD diagrams → Physical Prototype → Working Prototype.
* **Services Products:** Verbal demo → Process diagram → Sample deliverable (e.g., a report).

**08:43**  
I always recommend starting with the lowest fidelity demo possible that lets you tell a compelling before and after story. And if and only if your prospects need more proof should you build something that's higher fidelity. If you nailed a problem that they want solved with your UVP, they'll have no issue setting up a follow-up meeting when you're ready.

**09:04**  
**Principle 2: Use your demos to identify what customers want.**  
A demo is a perfect stand-in for your product, and because they're much easier and faster to create and update than a working product, they let you quickly home in on what customers want and exactly what to build. But this cuts both ways. It's very easy to over-promise features in your demo and then you're left with a rocket ship that goes to Mars that you have to then deliver.

**09:31**  
And when you cram in too much into your demos, you not only increase the scope of what you have to build, but you can also easily overwhelm and even scare away your customers. And this is why I recommend showing less, not more, in your demos. Treat your demos like a movie trailer and start with the most valuable thing first and then pause to see how the customer reacts. If the customer is ready to buy at that point, you're done. If, on the other hand, they still need to see more, move on to the next thing.

**10:01**  
The biggest objection I hear from founders about the demo-sell-build approach is, "What if I can't actually build what I demo?" Well, then you really have no business building this product in the first place. The demo-sell-build approach isn't about promising vaporware but about testing demand for a product you know you can build before you build it.

**10:23**  
This, of course, requires that you are a builder yourself or have access to a builder on your team who can assess the technical feasibility of your product. When dealing with new technology, it's perfectly okay to reserve some time upfront to do a quick "product spike." This is where you build a technical proof of concept which is not a working prototype but rather a quick product feasibility test. Once you're 80% confident that you can build what you plan to demo, then move on to the demo-sell-build process.

**10:55**  
**Principle 3: Customers seldom move faster than you.**  
The biggest fear I hear from founders with demo-sell-build is, "What if the customer actually says yes on the spot and wants to buy my unfinished product? What do I do then?" Well, first I want to remind you that making a sale is exactly what you're aiming for and a good problem to have. Most founders start with building products they hope customers will buy down the road; with demo-sell-build, you go from hoping to knowing they'll buy what you're going to build.

**11:24**  
And so if they say yes, remember Principle 3. The time from closing a deal to starting a trial or pilot is directly proportional to the size of the deal. As you saw in my B2B example, most large companies will move a lot slower than you, and the time from when they say yes to a paid pilot to when they actually complete legal, procurement, and assign resources to the product could be anywhere from two to four months. For more complex sales, this time could even be longer—six to nine months or more. This is precisely why you don't want to wait until your product is ready before engaging prospects.

**12:04**  
At the other extreme, the smaller the sale, the more willing the customer is to wait for a product, of course, up to a certain limit. If you've ever placed a pre-order for a product, you've experienced this. While it is certainly possible to make these types of customers wait as long as a year, I still recommend aiming for getting something to them in two to three months or less.

**12:26**  
This often requires rethinking the scope and definition of your product so you can start delivering the most valuable thing as quickly as possible. For a more concrete example of this, check out this video over here that shares a concrete case study of the very first product I launched using the demo-sell-build approach. Thanks for watching and until next time, take care.


### **Organized Notes: The Demo-Sell-Build Strategy**

**The Problem with Build-First (00:00 - 02:35)**
*   **Time Delays:** Founders underestimate "unknowable unknowns." Product building often takes months longer than planned.
*   **Scope Creep:** Founders get trapped in adding "just one more feature" before testing.
*   **Market Risk:** High probability of building the wrong product without early feedback.
*   **Technical Bias:** Founders waste time solving technical problems before confirming if anyone wants the solution.

**The Solution: Demo-Sell-Build (02:35 - 03:40)**
*   **Definition:** Sell a demo of the product *before* building the actual product.
*   **Purpose of a Demo:** To tell a story about the product's value/outcomes, not to prove it works.
*   **Low-Fidelity Options:**
    *   Verbal descriptions.
    *   Mockups/Screenshots.
    *   Simple pictures.
    *   Sample reports/deliverables.

**Case Study Lessons (03:40 - 07:21)**
*   **Machine Learning Startup:** Planned to wait two months for a working prototype.
*   **The Pivot:** Switched the demo to a *sample report* (the end result) rather than the software.
*   **Result:** Closed a paid pilot immediately. The customer’s procurement/legal process (2 months) matched the startup's development timeline.

**Three Core Principles (07:45 - 12:47)**

1.  **Promise Over Product (07:45):**
    *   Customers buy "better outcomes."
    *   Your UVP (Unique Value Proposition) is responsible for winning attention.
    *   The demo is responsible for winning trust.

2.  **Demo as a Discovery Tool (09:04):**
    *   Demos are faster to iterate than code.
    *   **The "Movie Trailer" Method:** Show the most valuable feature first, then stop and check for a reaction.
    *   **Technical Proof of Concept (The Product Spike):** Spend minimal time ensuring the 80% feasibility of an idea before selling it.

3.  **Customer Inertia (11:24):**
    *   Large deals involve legal and procurement cycles (2-9 months), giving founders time to build.
    *   Small deals (B2C) accept waiting for pre-orders (ideally 2-3 months).
    *   *Rule of thumb:* Never wait for a finished product to approach prospects.
