**How to Really Learn From Your Customers**

**Introduction: Why Most Founders Learn Backwards**

**00:00**
Most founders get this completely backwards. When they want to learn from customers, their first instinct is to create a survey, build a landing page, or start building a product. But these approaches can actually do more harm than good, especially at the early stages of your product. 

**00:16**
Today, I’m going to show you why these popular methods are traps, reveal the fastest way to actually learn from customers, and give you my top 3 tactics for maximizing learning from customers with the least amount of effort.

**00:29**
Hi there, if you’re new to this channel, my name is Ash Maurya. I’m an entrepreneur and author, and the creator of the popular one-page business modeling tool Lean Canvas, used by millions of founders around the world. On this channel, I share systematic strategies and techniques for launching and growing a startup. 

**The Problem with Popular "Learning" Methods**

**00:45**
So let me start by breaking down why the most common approaches to customer learning set you up for failure. 

**00:51**
Let's start with surveys. Surveys seldom lead to breakthrough insights. This is because they assume that you know the right questions to ask, but true innovation typically comes from non-obvious insights and at the earliest stages of a product, you often don't know what you don't know. 

**01:07**
When you couple that with the fact that what people say seldom matches what they do, surveys either end up confirming just surface-level insights that were already obvious, leading to no new learning or breakthrough, or worse, they result in false-positive insights that take you down the wrong path, wasting needless time, money, and effort. 

**The Problem with Landing Pages**

**01:29**
Next up is landing pages. Landing pages often result in an expensive guessing game, and here's why. The first challenge with landing pages is getting enough traffic to them. But let's say you manage to do that. 

**01:41**
The next challenge is optimizing your landing page by trying to figure out why people aren't doing the thing you expect them to be doing, like buying your product. Adding analytics only tells you what you already know: that no one is buying. But not necessarily why. 

**01:56**
You could of course try A/B testing, but there are too many things you could potentially change and test, and each test splits your traffic in half. And we're back to challenge number one. Unless you have a ton of traffic, reaching statistically significant results can take several weeks and sometimes even months. 

**02:13**
And you're still guessing at what exactly to test next. It's like trying to solve a puzzle while blindfolded. 

**The Build-First Trap**

**02:21**
Finally, let's talk about taking a build-first approach. Now a lot of people believe that giving customers an initial working product is the fastest way to learn, but a build-first approach today often ends up in a build trap. 

**02:35**
While vibe-coding or no-code AI-assisted coding tools are all the rage these days, the reality is that unless you know exactly what customers want, these tools only help you build more stuff faster, not necessarily the right stuff. 

**02:50**
And customers today already have too many choices to pick from. So imagine what happens when that increases threefold or tenfold. Their patience for half-baked solutions goes way down. 

**03:01**
When they encounter a half-baked solution, they don't turn into beta testers and give you feedback, they simply leave and move on to the next product. And so you're back to the landing page challenge where, without real customer feedback, you're still left guessing at what to improve and there are too many things you could potentially improve. 

**The Better Way: Customer Conversations**

**03:21**
So where do you start? In order to earn the attention of customers to where they give you meaningful feedback, you have to start by nailing their top problems exactly and better than anyone else right out of the gate. 

**03:34**
This begs the obvious next question: how do you do that? In other words, how do you determine exactly what customers want? After trying all the ways I've shared with you so far for many years, I have found time and time again that the fastest way to actually learn from customers isn't through surveys, landing pages, or beta testing a product, but rather through carefully scripted one-on-one customer conversations or interviews. 

**03:58**
And here's why this works when everything else fails. Customer conversations or interviews start with discovery before validation. Surveys and landing pages are validation tools. They help you validate hypotheses or assumptions in your head that you already have. 

**04:17**
Customer interviews, on the other hand, are discovery tools. They help you generate new hypotheses or new insights which is key to uncovering breakthroughs. You need to start with discovery before validation because you need to generate new insights before you can test them. 

**04:31**
The next reason is the power of why. Unlike a landing page, in an interview, you can ask why. You can dig deeper, you can explore unexpected directions. When someone tells you that they use a competitor's product, you can ask them why they chose it, what alternatives they considered, and what almost made them choose something else. It's in these stories where you're going to find the breakthrough insights. 

**04:54**
And finally, customer interviews aren't product pitches but learning devices where you prioritize learning before you pitch, or more specifically, getting to deeply understand problems before solutions. Problems, not solutions, create space for innovation. 

**05:09**
Starting with a solution, no matter how small, is like building a key without knowing what door you're trying to open. If you flip that around and start with problems, solution building becomes a whole lot easier. You start building keys to doors that actually take you places. 

**How Many Interviews Are Needed?**

**05:24**
Okay, so hopefully I have somewhat convinced you that you should start with talking to customers before using any of these other tools for validation. 

**05:33**
As talking to customers is new and uncomfortable for most founders, the most common next question I get is: how many people or how many customer interviews do I have to do? This is where most of the advice goes wrong again. 

**05:49**
Many accelerators and incubators will tell you to conduct at least a hundred customer interviews. Some even withhold funding until you hit these arbitrary quotas. This, again, is backwards thinking. 

**06:01**
Just like playing the scales on the piano for hundreds of hours doesn't make you a world-class piano player, simply talking to hundreds of people doesn't automatically lead to breakthrough insights. The key is to focus on the quality of learning versus quantity of interviews. 

**06:14**
I've been coaching founders on this for over a decade and I've found that 10 good interviews will beat a hundred mediocre interviews every single time. And the best part is that anyone can run 10 interviews and learn to run good interviews if you're willing to invest a little time to learn how to do so. 

**06:31**
In my book *Running Lean*, I provide a comprehensive step-by-step guide for conducting customer interviews, including a detailed interview script that you can follow. The book walks you through exactly what questions to ask, how to ask them, and in what order, so that you can systematically uncover the insights that matter most. 

**Understanding the Evidence Ladder**

**06:51**
The secret here isn't in the number of interviews you conduct, but it's in knowing who to interview. The reason people think they have to run hundreds of interviews is because they aren't talking to the right people. 

**07:02**
So in the next section, I'm going to share my top three tactics for finding the right people to interview. 

**Tactic 1: Don't Target Early Adopters (Yet)**

**07:07**
Let's start with tactic number one: don't target early adopters yet. This trips up most founders. Most people start customer discovery by trying to find their ideal early adopter. It seems logical, but it's wrong. 

**07:22**
Why? Because your early adopter definition is an output of customer discovery, not an input. When you start with your best guess of who your early adopters are, you risk going too narrow, finding some validation, and falling victim to what I call the local maximum trap. 

**07:41**
I'll illustrate this with an example. If I defined my audience for this channel, which is early-stage startup founders, as "two guys in a garage in Silicon Valley," I could fly there tomorrow and validate this assumption because I would surely find founders that match this definition. 

**07:56**
But if I then targeted just these founders, there is a 99% likelihood that I would miss you currently watching this video. Looking through my YouTube channel data, almost half my audience comes from India, and the US comprises only 13%. And if I double-click into the US cities, Silicon Valley totals just 1%. 

**08:14**
And so in other words, if I limited focus on just this Silicon Valley market, it would be like climbing a 1% hill and missing the 99% mountain of other founders like yourself who don't fit that stereotype. This local maximum or false positive is actually worse than finding invalidation because it leads you to waste time chasing the wrong market. 

**The Two-Phase Interview Approach**

**08:35**
So if you shouldn't prematurely define your early adopter segment, what should you do instead? To avoid this trap, I recommend running customer interviews in two phases. 

**08:45**
First, you run broad-match interviews where you intentionally cast a wider net so you can map the overall market and identify your real early adopter criteria. Then you follow up with narrow-match interviews where you home in on your identified early adopters for specific problems. 

**Tactic 2: Don't Target Specific Use Cases (Yet)**

**09:03**
Next, let's cover tactic number two: don't target specific use cases yet. Just as prematurely narrowing down on early adopters can lead to a local maximum, so does prematurely narrowing down on too specific a use case. 

**09:17**
The danger here is getting stuck in the solution-context. Consider this popular quote: "People don't want a quarter-inch drill bit, they want a quarter-inch hole." If you're a drill bit manufacturer, you could obsess about helping your customers drill perfectly round quarter-inch holes and build stronger drill bits. 

**09:35**
But what happens when a product like 3M's Command Strip comes along and steals away half your customers because they let people do the same thing without having to drill any holes? Drilling better quarter-inch holes is too specific a use case and not really what customers want. 

**09:51**
So how do you uncover what they want? By focusing on what comes after the hole or what I call the bigger context. Features and benefits live in the solution-context, but what customers really care about are jobs and desired outcomes, and those live in the bigger context. 

**10:06**
Your customer interviews should prioritize uncovering the bigger context by asking a few "why" questions before getting into "how" questions. 

**Tactic 3: Don't Target Active Shoppers (Yet)**

**10:15**
The next tactic is by far the biggest mistake I see when people start doing customer research. Most founders try to target potential customers or prospects—people actively looking to buy their product. This seems again logical, but active buyers make terrible interview subjects, which is tactic number three: don't target active shoppers yet. 

**10:35**
Why? Because they haven't bought anything yet and maybe they never will. Whatever they tell you is factual only up until the point they are in their current buyer journey. Everything else they tell you is hypothetical or made up. 

**10:49**
And one of my golden rules for running good customer interviews is: measure what they did, not what they say they'll do. Because what people say is highly unreliable. So the most actionable insights come from customers who have successfully hired and used a product, not from active buyers who might still be shopping for one. 

**The Value of Interviewing Competitors' Customers**

**11:08**
What about if you haven't finished your product and have no customers to interview? Here you can start by interviewing customers of the closest existing alternative that you are competing with. 

**11:17**
And only interview people who have recently spent time, invested effort, and ideally money on these existing alternatives. That's what separates customers from prospects or active buyers. 

**11:29**
Now talking to customers of existing alternatives may seem like moving you away from the goal of building a hot prospect pipeline, but counter-intuitively, this is the fastest way to build a hot prospect pipeline. 

**11:41**
Let me illustrate this concept with yet another example. Let's say you're a home builder. The best people to interview aren't people who are actively looking for a home because they may never buy and can't reliably tell you why, because they're still figuring that out. You'll need to run potentially a hundred interviews like these to weed through all the noise here. 

**12:01**
But happy customers are more alike versus unlike, which in this case is someone who has recently bought a home. Now someone who has recently bought a home will most likely not buy another house for several years, so they won't be your customer anytime soon. 

**12:15**
But because they have completed the complete customer buyer journey, they can tell you what worked, what didn't, and where they got stuck along the way. And it is this information that is gold. This is how you uncover non-obvious insights not to convert this one person who bought the house, but all the others out there who are earlier in their customer buyer journeys. 

**Conclusion: Start with Problems, Not Solutions**

**12:36**
And so hopefully I have convinced you by now to stop building before you understand the problem, stop surveying before you've discovered what to ask, and stop guessing when you can learn directly from the people that matter the most. 

**12:49**
And instead, start with problems, not solutions; start with discovery, not validation; and start with customer conversations, not building a product. 

**12:57**
The first secret to maximizing learning from customers per unit of effort is starting with who to interview. The next is knowing what to ask them. If you'd like to learn that, you should check out this video over here where I walk you through the exact steps for uncovering what customers want.

Thanks for watching, and until next time, take care.


### **Organized Notes: Effective Customer Discovery**

**Why Popular Methods Fail [00:45]**
*   **Surveys:** Limited by what the founder already knows to ask. People’s words rarely match their future actions.
*   **Landing Pages:** Create an "expensive guessing game." Analytics show failures but don't explain the "why."
*   **Build-First:** Without clear customer needs, founders simply build "more stuff faster," often leading to products no one wants.

**The Power of One-on-One Interviews [03:21]**
*   Interviews focus on **discovery** (generating new insights) rather than just validation (checking existing guesses).
*   Allows the founder to ask "**Why**," uncovering the stories and contexts behind choices.
*   Shifts focus to **problems** instead of solutions.

**Tactic 1: Avoid Premature Early Adopter Definition [07:07]**
*   The definition of an early adopter should be an **output** of discovery, not the starting point.
*   **Phase 1:** Conduct "broad-match" interviews to map the general market.
*   **Phase 2:** Conduct "narrow-match" interviews with the identified high-potential segment.

**Tactic 2: Focus on the Bigger Context [09:03]**
*   Don't get stuck in the "solution-context" (e.g., drilling a hole).
*   Focus on the "bigger context" (e.g., why they need a hole in the wall).
*   Understand the **desired outcome** to avoid being disrupted by unconventional solutions.

**Tactic 3: Interview Recent Buyers, Not Shoppers [10:15]**
*   Active shoppers (prospects) are unreliable because they haven't made a final decision.
*   Interview people who have **already completed** the buyer journey with an existing alternative.
*   They provide "gold" information on what worked, what didn't, and why they finally committed.

**The Golden Rule [10:51]**
*   **Measure what they did, not what they say they'll do.** Actions are the only reliable evidence for a startup.
