**If I Launched a Startup in 2026, I’d Do This**

**Introduction: The Rewarding Journey of a Startup Founder**

**00:00**
Becoming a startup founder is hands down one of the most rewarding decisions I've ever made in terms of the learning opportunities, growth opportunities, and the freedom it has given me. 

**00:09**
But venturing out on your own can be scary and startups are roller coasters. So in this video, I'm going to share my updated top 10 tips for aspiring founders who are maybe considering starting a company in 2026. 

**00:23**
Hi there, if you're new to this channel, my name is Ash Maurya. I'm an entrepreneur and author and the creator of the popular one-page business modeling tool, Lean Canvas, used by millions of founders around the world. On this channel, I document my from-the-trenches startup lessons, which I turn into systematic strategies and techniques for launching and growing startups. 

**00:43**
So let's dive into the list.

**Tip 10: Your Business Model is Greater Than Your Idea**

**00:46**
Coming in at number 10 is: Your business model is much, much greater than your idea. Now everyone obsesses over their idea. 

1. Is this THE idea? 
2. Is it big enough? 
3. Is it innovative enough? 

**00:57**
But this, I find, is the wrong question. The right question to be asking is: Does the business model work? I've seen brilliant ideas with broken business models fail; I've seen mediocre ideas with solid business models succeed. 

**01:11**
Here's what most founders miss. Before writing a single line of code or breaking out the product, stress-test your business model. One of the fastest ways to do this is to use a Lean Canvas, which is free at leancanvas.com. 

**01:26**
Think of a Lean Canvas as a one-page business plan, but unlike a business plan, which takes a long time to write, creating a Lean Canvas only takes 20 minutes and you can simply and easily share it with others. 

**Tip 9: Use AI to Learn Faster, Not Just Build Faster**

**01:38**
The next lesson is very timely given that we are living through the era of AI. Lesson number nine: Use AI to learn faster, not just build faster. I find that everyone is focusing on how can AI help me build faster. 

**01:49**
I totally get that because these tools unlock product development for a lot of people and it can potentially help you build a product 10 times faster. But I find that this too is not enough. It is not the right question. 

**02:08**
Building a successful product has never been about "Can I build this?" but rather "Should I build this?" And the real question isn't "How can AI help me build faster?" but rather "How can AI help me learn faster?" 

**02:21**
I'm actually launching a new product called LEANSpark in January 2026, which is an AI co-founder that helps you do exactly that. Founders who can build 10 times faster and learn 10 times faster will have a 100x advantage over others. If you want to learn more about LEANSpark, you should check out the link in the description below.

**Tip 8: Think of Your MVP as a Minimum Valuable Product**

**02:43**
So let's move on to lesson number eight: Think of your MVP as a minimum valuable, not just viable, product. A lot of people have heard of MVPs, but aiming at just viability or "Will customers pay for this?" is not enough. 

**02:57**
In order to build a successful startup product:
1. You have to focus on building something that isn't just viable.
2. But simultaneously desirable and feasible. 

**03:07**
If it's not something customers already want, you could drop your price down to zero and people won't still care about it. And if it's not something you can build quickly enough, you will fail to capture the market. 

**03:19**
So when you think of MVP, don't just think of building a minimum viable product; think of a product that is minimally desirable, viable, and feasible. And that's what I recently redefined as a minimum valuable product: 

1. Something that customers care about because you nail a problem that they want solved.
2. Something that is big enough that you can charge money for.
3. And deliver a solution quick enough so you start gaining traction in the market.

**Tip 7: Sell Before You Build**

**03:47**
Okay, so next up is lesson number seven: Sell before you build. Piggybacking on the last lesson, even when you know you can build your MVP, there's still a risk that you'll build something nobody wants because you haven't yet launched your product. 

**04:02**
Which is why you need to test your desirability, viability, and feasibility assumptions, ideally before you launch. Now this may be a bit counter-intuitive, but the best way to do this isn't by building a product first and seeing if anyone will care enough to buy it, but rather by flipping the script and selling your product before you build it. 

**04:20**
Think Demo-Sell-Build versus Build-Demo-Sell. If you can't sell the demo, why build the product? And no, contrary to common belief, you don't need a working product to deliver a compelling demo. 

**04:32**
I get this question a lot, so I recommend that you check out other videos on this channel for examples of how to do that. 

**Tip 6: Minimum Success Criteria Beats Perfect Validation**

**04:39**
Lesson number six: Minimum success criteria beats perfect validation every time. Founders waste six months, I find, chasing perfect validation. 

1. How many interviews is enough? 
2. How much data do I need for statistical significance? 

**04:54**
Here's the truth: You'll never have 100% certainty, especially in a startup. And even achieving statistical significance at the early stages of a product requires a lot more traffic and time that most founders just don't have. 

**05:08**
Instead, I recommend using the concept of a minimum success criteria. The basic premise here isn't to chase unrealistic, aspirational maximum upside goals, but rather to define realistic minimum goals that you can use to determine if your idea is on the right track or not. 

**05:27**
Think of it as the smallest outcome you would use to keep working on your project or idea. I recommend defining three time-horizons for your minimum success criteria:

1. **Founder-level:** This is where you try to think of the smallest outcome you would need to achieve in three years—which is enough time to get to product-market fit—to declare your project a success. As an example, when I was writing my first book, I set my minimum success criteria to selling at least 100,000 copies of my book in three years.

**05:59**
2. **90-day minimum success criteria goal:** This is where you extrapolate your three-year goal into something more tangible and immediate. If you can't hit your 90-day goal, you're sure not going to hit your 3 year goal, and so this is a focusing function.

**06:15**
3. **Experiment or sprint level:** This is down to the experiment or the sprint level. Think of a sprint as a two-week time-box that you use to test your idea. The key question to ask here is: What meaningful progress can you make to move the needle on your idea in the next two weeks? Then get to work. 

**06:35**
When you use this three-level minimum success criteria framework, the question becomes not "Do I have perfect data to analyze my idea?" but rather the question becomes "Do I have sufficient data or evidence to move my idea forward?" And if not, how do I course-correct or pivot to get there? 

**Tip 5: Stop Guessing What to Build Next (Use the RICE Formula)**

**06:53**
In that same vein, lesson number five: Stop guessing on what to build next, use the RICE formula instead. Now your gut is going to tell you most of the times to fix the easiest thing or the most exciting thing for you. 

**07:07**
But how do you know that is the right thing that will move the needle on your idea? At any given time there can be multiple paths to go down. How do you know which is the right one? 

**07:17**
The way that I do this is at the start of every 90-day cycle, I make a list of all the ways I can hit my 90-day goal. I know I can't do all of these things simultaneously, and so I rank each one using a Fermi RICE framework. 

**07:31**
If you want to see the full framework, you should check out this video over here. The goal here isn't aiming for perfect planning, but using a good-enough rapid estimation methodology to pick potential winning ideas from losers. Then you start working on your most promising shortlist of ideas and use the next lesson to determine if you picked correctly.

**Tip 4: Use an Evidence Ladder to Test What’s Working**

**07:52**
Lesson number four: Use an evidence ladder to test what's working. This is one of my favorite W. Edwards Deming quotes of all time: "In God we trust, all others bring data." 

**08:02**
When it comes to validation, most founders collect the wrong kind of validation. They ask, "Would you use this?" and people say, "Yeah, probably! Maybe!" That's pretty worthless because people usually don't follow up with what they say they'll do down the road. 

**08:18**
The idea of the evidence ladder is to map your prospects or what they say or do into four levels:

1. **Opinions:** These are things like "Yeah, I'd probably use that," which is not all that strong.
2. **Evidence of Active Search:** This is where you find your prospects or potential customers actively seeking or using other solutions, which is more promising than level one.
3. **Actual Commitment:** This is where you get a prospect to pre-order or commit to using your product with something like a letter of intent or actual payment. And as you can see, this is a lot stronger than level one.
4. **Retained Revenue:** The ultimate level is retained revenue. Can you actually secure payment from your customers?

**09:03**
Which is the first form of validation. I say first because simply getting someone to pay you doesn't mean they won't ask for your money back a little down the road. 

**09:10**
The ultimate validation in my opinion is level five: **Activation**. This is where you create a happy customer and when you do that repeatedly, people stay with your product. They keep buying your product, and they refer you to others. And that is the most promising rung in the evidence ladder.

**Tip 3: Your Constraint is Actually Your Advantage**

**09:28**
Okay, so with that let's move on to lesson number three: Your constraint is actually your advantage. If you're a startup founder, I know you're no stranger to constraints. 

**09:38**
Things like:
1. I can't start because I don't have enough MONEY.
2. I don't have enough NETWORK.
3. Or fill in the blank here with some other resource that you don't yet have enough of. 

**09:47**
If you want to be successful as a founder, you can afford to fall victim to your constraints, which can be very paralyzing, but you have to instead find a way to flip the script and break the constraint. 

**10:00**
The best way I have found over the years for doing this is asking yourself a propelling question like: How can I sell my product if I don't have a team, or money to build it? 

**010:11**
Rather than falling victim and doing nothing, think out of the box and you'll find several answers, even in the past tips that I shared up above. Things like:
1. Think minimum valuable product and reduce scope.
2. Sell before you build to attract customers. 
3. Then use that evidence of early traction to then attract early team members and potentially investment, if you still need it.

**Tip 2: Have Faith in Yourself, Be Ruthless With Your Assumptions**

**10:31**
Moving on to lesson number two: Have faith in yourself, be ruthless with your assumptions. So there's no such thing as a perfect idea because your idea will change, your business model will evolve, and your first customers won't be your last. 

**10:45**
That's completely normal. But what doesn't change is your ability to learn, adapt, and systematically de-risk your idea. 

**10:53**
Don't ask "Is this THE idea?" instead ask "Am I the founder who can search for the RIGHT idea that works?" The skill isn't having perfect intuition; the skill is having systematic validation technique. 

**11:06**
Have faith in the process, be ruthless with your plan A. Every successful founder I know has pivoted multiple times on their idea, which again is completely normal. 

**11:16**
The way you reduce the drama on these pivots is by doing them quickly and continuously. When you're making mini-course corrections along the way, you replace failure with learning, which is the key to faster breakthroughs. 

**Tip 1: Just Start**

**11:29**
And finally, lesson number one: Just start. No YouTube video or book or course is going to make you succeed. If you're waiting for: 
1. The perfect idea
2. More research
3. Better timing
4. More savings
5. Or one more course

**11:43**
My advice is to stop chasing that and instead, just start. Entrepreneurship is like a martial art: You can't learn from the sidelines, you have to learn by doing. 

**11:53**
You don't need a perfect idea, you just need 90 days and the right mindset to start and then iteratively take your idea from a starting plan A to a plan that works. 

**Conclusion and Next Steps**

**12:04**
Now if you're considering starting up in 2026 or course-correcting your already started idea, next week I'm releasing my complete and updated "If I Launched a Startup in 2026" playbook with the exact 90-day system, week-by-week. 

**12:21**
I hope to see you then. Until then, take care.

### **Organized Notes**

**Foundational Strategy & Mindset**
*   **The Business Model Focus [00:46]:** Success isn't about having the perfect idea but building a working business model. Use tools like **Lean Canvas** for rapid deconstruction.
*   **AI as a Learning Accelerator [01:38]:** Don't just use AI to build (code/assets) faster. Use it to learn and validate market needs 10x faster.
*   **The Power of Constraints [09:28]:** Use a "Propelling Question" to turn lack of resources into a strategic filter (e.g., How to sell without a team?).
*   **Founder Identity [10:31]:** Faith should be in your ability to validate and pivot, not in the immutability of your original idea.

**Product Development Frameworks**
*   **Minimum Valuable Product (MVP) [02:43]:** Redefining the MVP from "Viable" (bare minimum) to "Valuable." It must be desirable (customer wants it), viable (business can sustain it), and feasible (founder can build it).
*   **Demo-Sell-Build [03:47]:** Validating demand before investing in supply. High-ticket B2B sales often use demos and pilots ($100k+) before full product usage.
*   **RICE Formula [06:53]:** A Fermi-style estimation method to prioritize what to build/test next based on Impact, Reach, Confidence, and Effort.

**Validation & Measurement**
*   **The Evidence Ladder [07:52]:** Progressively stronger forms of data:
    1.  Opinions (Weakest)
    2.  Active Search
    3.  Commitment (Pre-orders/LOIs)
    4.  Retained Revenue (Activation)
*   **Minimum Success Criteria [04:39]:** Instead of 100% certainty, look for "sufficient evidence."
    *   **Three Horizons [05:32]:** 3-Year (Founder Goal), 90-Day (Immediate Milestone), 2-Week (Sprint Progress).

**Execution**
*   **The 90-Day Cycle [05:27]:** Long enough to de-risk an idea, short enough to maintain high urgency.
*   **Just Start [11:29]:** Avoid over-preparation. Startup skills are learned by doing, not by watching or reading.
