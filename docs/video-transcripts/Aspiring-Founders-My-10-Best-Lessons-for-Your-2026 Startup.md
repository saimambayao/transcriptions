**Introduction: Startups are Roller Coasters**

**00:00**
Becoming a startup founder is hands down one of the most rewarding decisions I've ever made in terms of the learning opportunities, growth opportunities, and the freedom it has given me. But venturing out on your own can be scary, and startups are roller coasters. In this video, I'm going to share my updated top 10 tips for aspiring founders who are maybe considering starting a company in 2026.

**00:23**
Hi there, if you're new to this channel, my name is Ash Maurya. I'm an entrepreneur and author and the creator of the popular one-page business modeling tool Lean Canvas, used by millions of founders around the world. On this channel, I document my from-the-trenches startup lessons which I turn into systematic strategies and techniques for launching and growing startups.

**Lesson #10: Your Business Model > Your Idea**

**00:43**
Coming in at number 10 is your business model is much, much greater than your idea. Everyone obsesses over their idea. Is this the idea? Is it big enough? Is it innovative enough? But this, I find, is the wrong question.

**01:00**
The right question to be asking is: does the business model work? I've seen brilliant ideas with broken business models fail; I've seen mediocre ideas with solid business models succeed.

**01:11**
Here is what most founders miss: before writing a single line of code or breaking out the product, stress-test your business model. One of the fastest ways to do this is to use a Lean Canvas, which is free at leancanvas.com.

**01:26**
Think of a Lean Canvas as a one-page business plan. But unlike a business plan, which takes a long time to write, creating a Lean Canvas only takes 20 minutes, and you can simply and easily share it with others.

**Lesson #9: Use AI to Learn Faster, Not Just Build Faster**

**01:38**
The next lesson is very timely given that we are living through the era of AI. Lesson number nine: use AI to learn faster, not just build faster. I find that everyone is focusing on how AI can help them build faster.

**01:54**
I totally get that because these tools unlock product development for a lot of people, and it can potentially help you build a product 10 times faster. But I find that this, too, is not enough. It is not the right question.

**02:08**
Building a successful product has never been about "Can I build this?" but rather "Should I build this?" And the real question isn't "How can AI help me build faster?" but rather "How can AI help me learn faster?"

**02:21**
I'm actually launching a new product called LeanSpark in January 2026, which is an AI co-founder that helps you do exactly that. Founders who can build 10 times faster and learn 10 times faster will have a 100x advantage over others.

**Lesson #8: Think of Your MVP as a Minimum Valuable Product**

**02:42**
Lesson number eight: think of your MVP as a minimum valuable, not just viable, product. A lot of people have heard of MVPs, but aiming at just viability or "will customers pay for this" is not enough.

**02:57**
In order to build a successful startup product, you have to focus on building something that isn't just viable, but simultaneously desirable and feasible.

**03:07**
If it's not something customers already want, you could drop your price down to zero and people still won't care about it. And if it's not something you can build quickly enough, you will fail to capture the market.

**03:19**
So when you think of MVP, don't just think of building a minimum viable product; think of a product that is minimally desirable, viable, and feasible. And that's what I recently redefined as a minimum valuable product.

**03:33**
1. Something that customers care about because you nail a problem that they want solved.
2. Something that is big enough that you can charge money for.
3. And deliver a solution quick enough so you start gaining traction in the market.

**Lesson #7: Sell Before You Build**

**03:47**
Lesson number seven: sell before you build. Piggybacking on the last lesson, even when you know you can build your MVP, there's still a risk that you'll build something nobody wants because you haven't yet launched your product.

**04:02**
Which is why you need to test your desirability, viability, and feasibility assumptions, ideally before you launch. This may be a bit counter-intuitive, but the best way to do this isn't by building a product first and seeing if anyone will care enough to buy it.

**04:16**
Instead, flip the script and sell your product before you build it. Think demo-sell-build versus build-demo-sell. If you can't sell the demo, why build the product?

**04:26**
And no, contrary to common belief, you don't need a working product to deliver a compelling demo. I get this question a lot, so I recommend that you check out other videos on this channel for examples of how to do that.

**Lesson #6: Minimum Success Criteria Beats Perfect Validation**

**04:39**
Lesson number six: minimum success criteria beats perfect validation every time. Founders waste six months, I find, chasing perfect validation. How many interviews is enough? How much data do I need for statistical significance?

**04:54**
The truth is: you'll never have 100% certainty, especially in a startup. And even achieving statistical significance at the early stages of a product requires a lot more traffic and time than most founders just don't have.

**05:08**
Instead, I recommend using the concept of a minimum success criteria. The basic premise here isn't to chase unrealistic, aspirational, maximum upside goals, but rather to define realistic minimum goals that you can use to determine if your idea is on the right track or not.

**05:27**
Think of it as the smallest outcome you would use to keep working on your project or idea. I recommend defining three time-horizons for your minimum success criteria.

**05:37**
The first is at the founder level. This is where you try to think of the smallest outcome you would need to achieve in three years, which is enough time to get to product-market fit, to declare your project a success.

**05:50**
As an example, when I was writing my first book, I set my minimum success criteria to selling at least 100,000 copies of my book in three years.

**05:59**
The next level here is the 90-day minimum success criteria goal. This is where you extrapolate your three-year goal into something more tangible and immediate. If you can't hit your 90-day goal, you're sure not going to hit your three-year goal, and so this is a focusing function.

**06:15**
You can go even a further level down which I recommend, which is down to the experiment or the sprint level. Think of a sprint as a two-week timebox that you use to test your ideas.

**06:26**
The key question to ask here is: what meaningful progress can you make to move the needle on your idea in the next two weeks? Then get to work.

**06:35**
When you use this three-level minimum success criteria framework, the question becomes not "Do I have perfect data to analyze my idea?" but rather "Do I have sufficient data or evidence to move my idea forward?" And if not, how do I course-correct or pivot to do so?

**Lesson #5: Stop Guessing What to Build Next**

**06:53**
In that same vein, lesson number five: stop guessing on what to build next; use the RICE formula instead. Your gut is going to tell you most of the times to fix the easiest thing or the most exciting thing for you.

**07:07**
But how do you know that is the right thing that's going to move the needle on your idea? At any given time, there can be multiple paths to go down. How do you know which is the right one?

**07:17**
The way that I do this is at the start of every 90-day cycle, I make a list of all the ways I can hit my 90-day goal. I know I can't do all of these things simultaneously, and so I rank each one using a Fermi RICE framework.

**07:31**
If you want to see the full framework, you should check out this video over here. The goal here isn't aiming for perfect planning, but using a good enough rapid estimation methodology to pick potential winning ideas from losers.

**07:44**
Then you start working on your most promising shortlist of ideas and use the next lesson to determine if you picked correctly.

**Lesson #4: Use an Evidence Ladder to Test What’s Working**

**07:51**
Lesson number four: use an evidence ladder to test what's working. This is one of my favorite W. Edwards Deming quotes of all time: "In God we trust, all others bring data."

**08:02**
When it comes to validation, most founders collect the wrong kind of validation. They ask, "Would you use this?" and people say, "Yeah, probably, maybe!" That's pretty worthless because people usually don't follow up with what they say they'll do down the road.

**08:18**
The idea of the evidence ladder is to map your prospects or what they say or do into four levels. Level one is opinions. And these are things like "Yeah, I'd probably use that," which is not all that strong.

**08:31**
Level two is evidence of active search. This is where you find your prospects or potential customers actively seeking or using other solutions, which is more promising than level one.

**08:42**
Level three is actual commitment. This is where you get a prospect to pre-order or commit to using your product with something like a letter of intent or actual payment. As you can see, this is a lot stronger than level one.

**08:55**
But the ultimate level is level four, retained revenue. Can you actually secure payment from your customers, which is the first form of validation?

**09:03**
I say "first" because simply getting someone to pay you doesn't mean they won't ask for their money back a little down the road. The ultimate validation, in my opinion, is level five: activation.

**09:14**
This is where you create a happy customer, and when you do that repeatedly, people stay with your product. They keep buying your product, and they refer you to others. And that is the most promising rung in the evidence ladder.

**Lesson #3: Your Constraint is Actually Your Advantage**

**09:30**
Lesson number three: your constraint is actually your advantage. If you're a startup founder, I know you're no stranger to constraints. Things like "I can't start because I don't have enough time, money, network," or fill in the blank here with some other resource that you don't yet have enough of.

**09:48**
If you want to be successful as a founder, you can't afford to fall victim to your constraints, which can be very paralyzing. But you have to instead find a way to flip the script and break the constraint.

**10:00**
The best way I have found over the years for doing this is asking yourself a propelling question like: "How can I sell my product if I don't have a team or money to build it?"

**10:11**
Rather than falling victim and doing nothing, think out of the box and you'll find several answers even in the past tips that I shared up above:
* Think minimum valuable product and reduce scope.
* Sell before you build to attract customers.
* Then use that evidence of early traction to secure team members and potentially investment, if you still need it.

**Lesson #2: Have Faith in Yourself, Be Ruthless With Your Assumptions**

**10:31**
Lesson number two: have faith in yourself; be ruthless with your assumptions. There is no such thing as a perfect idea because your idea will change, your business model will evolve, and your first customers won't be your last.

**10:45**
That's completely normal. But what doesn't change is your ability to learn, adapt, and systematically de-risk your idea.

**10:53**
Don't ask "Is this the idea?"; instead ask "Am I the founder who can search for the right idea that works?" The skill isn't having perfect intuition; the skill is systematic validation technique.

**11:06**
Have faith in the process; be ruthless with your Plan A. Every successful founder I know has pivoted multiple times on their idea, which again is completely normal.

**11:16**
The way you reduce the drama on these pivots is by doing them quickly and continuously. When you're making mini-course corrections along the way, you replace failing with learning, which is the key to faster breakthroughs.

**Lesson #1: Just Start**

**11:29**
Lesson number one: just start. No YouTube video or book or course is going to make you succeed. If you're waiting for: the perfect idea, more research, better timing, more savings, or one more course, my advice is to stop chasing that and instead, just start.

**11:48**
Entrepreneurship is like a martial art. You can't learn from the sidelines; you have to learn by doing. You don't need a perfect idea; you just need 90 days and the right mindset to start, and then iteratively take your idea from a starting Plan A to a plan that works.

**12:04**
Now, if you're considering starting up in 2026 or course-correcting your already started idea, next week I'm releasing my complete and updated "If I Launched a Startup in 2026" playbook with the exact 90-day system that I use, broken down week-by-week. I hope to see you then. Until then, take care.

### **Notes**

**I. Strategic Foundation (Tip 10 - 8)**
*   **[00:43] Business Model > Idea:** Founders often obsess over the innovation of an idea, but the model determines success. Mediocre ideas with solid models succeed more often than brilliant ideas with broken models.
*   **[01:11] Stress-Testing:** Use the Lean Canvas (20 mins) to map out your business plan on a single page before building.
*   **[01:38] AI for Learning:** AI should be used as a validation tool, not just a coding tool. The focus must be "Should I build this?" rather than "Can I build this?"
*   **[02:42] MVP Redefined:** Shift from "Viable" (can it exist?) to "Valuable" (is it desirable and feasible?). A true MVP nails a specific problem customers will pay to solve quickly.

**II. Validation Frameworks (Tip 7 - 4)**
*   **[03:47] Sell Before Build:** Use "Demo-Sell-Build" to test desirability assumptions before writing code. A working product isn't required for a compelling demo.
*   **[04:39] Minimum Success Criteria (MSC):** Perfect validation is a myth. Instead of chasing statistical significance, define the "smallest outcome" needed to keep going across three horizons:
    *   Founder Level (3 years)
    *   Cycle Level (90 days)
    *   Sprint Level (2 weeks)
*   **[06:53] Prioritization (RICE):** Stop guessing features based on gut feelings. Use the RICE framework at the start of each 90-day cycle to rank possible paths.
*   **[07:51] The Evidence Ladder:** Rank validation by strength:
    1. Opinions (weak)
    2. Active Search
    3. Commitment (LOI/Payment)
    4. Revenue
    5. Activation (repeat usage/referrals) - the ultimate validation.

**III. Mindset and Action (Tip 3 - 1)**
*   **[09:30] Constraint as Advantage:** Lack of time/money forces creative solutions. Ask "Propelling Questions" to break limitations (e.g., "How do I sell without a team?").
*   **[10:31] Search vs. Intuition:** Success comes from the ability to search for a working idea via systematic validation, not perfect initial intuition.
*   **[11:16] Pivoting:** Pivots are normal. Continuous mini-corrections replace "failure" with "learning."
*   **[11:29] Just Start:** Entrepreneurship is a "martial art"—you must learn by doing. All that is needed is 90 days and the right mindset.
*   **[12:10] Roadmap:** Ash Maurya is releasing a week-by-week 90-day playbook for launching a startup in 2026.
