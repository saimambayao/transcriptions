How Elon Musk Actually Thinks: The 5 Operating Mechanisms

**00:00**
Most people have no idea how Elon Musk actually thinks. They see the chaos, the headlines, the personality, but they never see the operating mechanisms underneath it all. Mechanisms that allowed him to do things that most normal founders couldn't even survive, let alone execute at a global scale.

**00:14**
Today, I'm going to reveal the five operating mechanisms that Elon Musk deploys across every company he operates. And most importantly, the versions of these mechanisms that you can use without it destroying your life, your team, or your sanity.

**00:25**
If you've ever wondered how one human builds rockets, cars, A.I. labs, and brain interfaces, all while melting down on Twitter, well, here's the real answer.

**00:34**
Before we dive in, I've got something for you. It's called the algorithm deletion exercise, and you can go and find it via the first link in the description. I've gone and synthesized every one of the five steps that we go over here in this video so you can go and apply it to your team, your funnel, your business, your life, to go and radically simplify things just like Elon does.

**Mechanism 1: Maniacal Sense of Urgency**

**00:56**
Mechanism one: maniacal sense of urgency. Urgency isn't about working faster; it's about compressing the feedback loop between problem discovery and solution generation.

**01:05**
After reading the Elon Musk book by Walter Isaacson, it struck me that one of the core operating principles that Elon has across every one of his companies is that they operate with a maniacal sense of urgency.

**01:18**
Let me give you an example here. Let's rewind to 2017, 2018. Tesla, it's in the Fremont factory. We call this era of Elon "production hell." He was going and pushing to get the factory to get to 5,000 cars per month of output, and they were running into some serious problems.

**01:37**
No one really had the clear answer. So what did he do? Well, he operated with a maniacal sense of urgency. And the number one way that he knew to kind of go and compress that feedback loop was to fly directly to where the bottleneck was and go and camp out until the problem was fixed.

**01:55**
Where most founders or CEOs would get a manager to tell a manager to tell a manager to then get the problem solved, Elon went directly to the source. He went and camped out on the literal factory floor.

**02:07**
Bloomberg reported that he was sleeping under his desk for a month until this problem was fixed, working directly with the individual engineer on the factory floor that was in charge of a specific bottleneck. Sure enough, it was fixed.

**02:21**
This story really illustrates the power of really attacking a bottleneck with everything you got and really operating with this maniacal sense of urgency. I think too often as founders we let things slide. We take timelines as, "you know, that'll take a few months," or "this may take a couple of weeks," and we just accept that as maybe the way it's got to be.

**02:42**
But with Elon, you can see time and time again, he doesn't accept the timelines he is given. He's constantly going and seeing how he can compress time.

**02:51**
Traditional companies go from problem to meeting to a committee to then finally deciding and then testing over three weeks. And then after those tests are done, probably just coming back to another series of meetings and other committees.

**03:04**
Elon shows that he does anything but that. With Elon, it's: let's talk about the problem, let's decide, let's test it. And that whole process may just last three hours.

**03:14**
So what we're seeing here is like a 100X compression cycle. And you multiply that over the next hundred or a thousand decisions, you're literally moving thousands of times faster than anyone else in your niche.

**03:26**
So here's what I want you to do. I want you to take one project, one decision you've been sitting on, and compress its timeline by 80%. To be clear here, I'm not asking you to go and sleep under your office desk.

**03:38**
But what I am asking you to do is to challenge yourself as to how can you have more decision velocity. Often times as high performers we want to wait until we have all of the data to make a decision.

**03:50**
Often times what's required is to make decisions with just 80% of the data that you have, and take pride in just making the call. Because where one person may take two weeks to make one decision, you can make a hundred decisions in two weeks.

**04:02**
Yeah, you're going to make some mistakes, but at least overall, net, you're moving a lot faster and compressing timelines. Keep in mind that most decisions are two-way doors. You make the wrong decision? No worries, just iterate and pivot. It's not the end of the world and it's also not worth sitting on for weeks.

**04:19**
Learn to start making decisions with an incomplete set of data. Look at the areas where you can start going and attacking the bottleneck. Typically there's one core area that's holding up the entire assembly line of your company.

**04:32**
Identify the owner of that area and deeply understand, "what is really the problem here?" Once you understand the root cause of that problem, go and attack it with full force in the urgency of Elon.

**Mechanism 2: The Algorithm**

**04:45**
Now let's move on to the algorithm that Elon uses to strip away everything unnecessary. Mechanism two: the algorithm. Elon Musk has an algorithm that he applies to everything, whether it's brain interfaces, rockets, or cars, or even his own org chart.

**04:58**
It's ruthless, it's simple, and it's the reason that SpaceX can build rockets for a fraction of NASA's cost. Here's how it works. What I'm about to share with you is something that probably can save you thousands of hours.

**05:09**
So there was a period early on in Tesla where Elon was obsessed with automation. This went well for a little bit, but then they started running into some production problems. And what Elon quickly realized is that he jumped to automate things way too fast.

**05:24**
And he ended up sending out an email to all the staff saying that he had screwed up this decision. Sure enough, one day he came into the Tesla factory with a bottle of orange spray paint and started spray painting every single robot on the floor that they'd have to go and remove.

**05:39**
This painful process taught Elon the importance of deleting and simplifying before you automate. And so sure enough, as he started going and building SpaceX, he was able to go and take these lessons to improve the rocket process to produce rockets that were far cheaper than NASA's.

**05:56**
The story of Elon actually building rockets goes back to early 2000s of him actually going and flying to the Soviet Union to go and look at purchasing rockets from the Russians.

**06:07**
As they went and started quoting him on different prices, he started realizing, "you know, why does it cost this much? Why are we even doing this?" And this is what then caused him to start building his own rockets at SpaceX.

**06:19**
Now, along the way, there's been a constant push inside of these companies for, you know, different features, different requirements, different things added to things. And before Elon goes and adds in anything, he goes, "why do we even need this? and who is even suggesting this?"

**06:35**
He can go and look at any part across any rocket, any car, and go down to who actually suggested this requirement so that everyone is accountable for what they're adding. That way, the default in the company is not just to add things and think that you can just get away with it.

**06:50**
In every single piece of what they're building, they're always trying to go and delete first, simplify things, and then get things down to the bare necessities. Because truthfully, you can't just have a bunch of shit slapped onto a rocket and think you're going to get that thing into orbit.

**The 5 Steps of the Algorithm**

**07:05**
The algorithm is Elon's operating system. It helps him think through every problem and it's deceptively simple. Let me break down all five steps because this will change how you build.

**07:14**
Step one: question every requirement. The key thing that Elon shows here is that he asks who is suggesting this requirement, and then making sure that he understands the root reason as to why they are adding this given thing. Because he knows that every single thing you add just adds more complexity later.

**07:32**
Step two: delete parts of the process. We all know, right, there's no sense hiring someone for a role that you don't even need in the first place. There's no sense automating a task that you shouldn't even be doing in the first place.

**07:43**
I know in my own career, I've learned this the hard way. When I was 25 building Herb, I went on a hiring spree hiring a bunch of roles that later on I learned I didn't even need these folks. And then I had to make the tough decision of letting a bunch of folks go because I had chosen to scale up a department that really wasn't even required for us to go and achieve the vision we wanted.

**08:03**
Really making sure that you delete before you automate is super key. Step three: simplify what remains. Whether it's Elon or it's Steve Jobs and his insanely simple values, whether it's simplifying brain interfaces, it's making sure that Tesla and the parts are as simple as possible so they're not over-engineering things. The core thing here is that simplicity is key.

**08:24**
Step four then is to accelerate cycle time. Elon constantly asks himself, "how fast can we test this?" When you're going and building something, again, it's that learning agility that will set you apart.

**08:35**
Where your competitor maybe takes six months to ship something and then another six months to iterate, if you're able to go and compress those cycle times to days, you can imagine how much further you'll be than the competitor in a year or even five years.

**08:49**
Speed is your competitive advantage, especially as a small company. Step five is to automate last. Only move to automation when you first gone and you've deleted things, you've got core owners of the pieces that have been added, you've simplified things as much as possible. Then and only then are you ready to automate.

**09:08**
And here's why this matters so much: most companies are drowning in inherited complexity. Inherited complexity is the silent killer. It's essentially all those processes, tasks, and people that you just inherit and a lot of people just accept as the way things are.

**09:23**
**Mechanism 1: Maniacal Sense of Urgency (continued)**

**09:23**
We've all been there, right? You go and you ask someone on your team, "Why are we doing it this way?" And they say, "Oh well, that's how I was brought on and that's what I was trained on." Or, "You know, this is how we've always done it." And that sort of mentality is a disease. Delete that shit, simplify things, and question every requirement.

**09:42**
So here's your exercise: pick one area of your business—could be your content workflow, your funnel, your team—and then run the algorithm through it. If you haven't downloaded the algorithm deletion exercise yet, go and do that.

**09:54**
I've literally synthesized a checklist and exercise that you can take to go and run Elon's algorithm through core aspects of your company and implement this today to radically simplify your business and your life. To go and radically simplify things just like Elon does. Go and get that, link in the description and follow along.

**Mechanism 3: Unreasonable Teams**

**10:05**
Mechanism 3: build unreasonable teams. Elon doesn't just hire for culture fit; he hires for aligned maniacs that are obsessed around getting to the mission. And this serves as the filter by which he hires every single person on his team.

**10:20**
November 2022, Elon just bought Twitter. He sends an email to the entire team and it's one of the most controversial moves I've ever seen. So he sends out an email to the entire company called "A Fork in the Road."

**10:35**
Basically saying that on a go-forward basis, they were going to operate in a hardcore mode. That the company would have to be completely transformed because the old way of doing things basically wasn't going to cut it anymore. 

**10:50**
He gave them a link in that email to click it and then subscribe to this new form of culture or just opt in to receiving a severance. This is just an example of the kind of culture that Elon Musk is focused on creating. 

**11:03**
And by no means am I saying that you need to have some ultra hardcore company culture. Each culture is different just like the personalities of humans. But the real thing that's important is that you have a culture that is aligned, right? And that you don't have detractors. 

**11:18**
The core thing that Elon's obsessed with is that he wants these maniacs. He wants these people that want to be hardcore. Now I'm not saying you should copy that email, but there's a deeper principle going on here around aligned maniacs. 

**11:31**
You either get people to subscribe to your culture or you remove them. Because the reality is, building a company is fucking hard. And building a company with a bunch of people with their own agendas is even harder. 

**11:43**
If you're building a company, be clear on what are YOUR values. You know, what are those uniting principles that determine the kind of people that you want on the ship and the people that you're going to say no to? 

**11:55**
And make sure that every single person on your team embodies that. Be intentional about that culture setting and make sure everyone is on board. To be clear, this isn't about abuse, although many people would say otherwise. 

**12:10**
What he's really looking for here is people that are mission obsessed. You know, and I can understand it, right? The guy is trying to send people to Mars. And this level of, you know, a mission, this level of complexity in terms of what they're trying to do requires a different kind of human and a different kind of culture. 

**12:28**
What he needs is people that are obsessed with "getting there" because anything less than that ain't going to cut it. And here's the uncomfortable truth that most founders don't want to hear: great companies are built by unreasonable people doing unreasonable things. 

**12:43**
Reasonable people optimize for consensus; unreasonable people optimize for breakthroughs. And you can't have both. Steve Jobs was unreasonable with design details. Elon Musk is unreasonable in his deletion of things. Bezos was unreasonable with the level at which he was obsessed around customers. 

**13:00**
Success leaves clues. It's easy with a lot of these guys to be a spectator, right? To look at what they're doing and think, "you know, that's abuse" or "that's crazy" or "I would never do that." And that's probably the truth: you WOULD never do that, right? Which is why you're at where you're at and they're legends. Because they defy all odds.

**Mechanism 4: Iterate at the Speed of Thought**

**13:18**
Mechanism number 4: iterate at the speed of thought. SpaceX treats every single launch like a data pipeline. They optimize for learning velocity, not perfection, so they're able to get more done in six months than others get done in five years.

**13:31**
You know, a big difference when Elon was building SpaceX versus NASA was this idea that at SpaceX they ALLOWED rockets to fail. You know, up until this point NASA had constantly said that we do not allow rockets to blow up. 

**13:43**
You know, after the 80s when the Challenger blew up and there was, I think, six astronauts all killed on board, they were super aggressive with just no rockets blowing up. But with Elon, his whole principle was we want to learn fast, right? 

**13:58**
If that means along the way we blow up some rockets, that's just part of the price to make humans a multi-planetary species. And from changing this single rule, it allowed the overall culture to iterate a ton faster. 

**14:10**
Because they didn't have to worry that hey, if a rocket blows up, everything's over. Instead it's: that's just kind of the cost of this insane mission that we have ahead of us. 

**14:19**
April 20th, 2023, the biggest rocket launch in human history. Starship is 400 feet tall. It's launch day. Three minutes into going and launching this rocket, it blows up. A massive fireball. And that's not it. 

**14:32**
The media is instantly reporting this as a disaster, a massive failure. But what does Elon do? Three minutes later he goes and tweets out: "Congrats @SpaceX team on an exciting test launch of Starship! Learned a lot for next test launch in a few months." 

**14:46**
Now this is just the mindset of Elon at work, right? Iterate at the speed of thought. You blew up a rocket? Good. You're going to learn from where the mistake was, you're going to iterate and you're going to improve for next time. 

**14:58**
Most companies would have shut down for years to investigate. Elon went and launched his next rocket seven months later. This is the power of iterating fast. Iteration beats perfectionism every single time. 

**15:11**
NASA's approach is to spend five years planning and over 20 billion dollars of cost for about 10 iterative cycles. Elon's approach is spend 3 billion dollars at SpaceX, go and compress time into just a couple of years, and spend a fraction of the price—only 3 billion dollars. 

**15:27**
Who wins? Well, SpaceX. And the core thing here is that they're not afraid to fail. Because every failure is a datapoint; every datapoint equals intelligence; and every piece of intelligence goes and is driven back into iteration.

**15:41**
Which allows you to go and iterate on the product 10 times faster than competitors like NASA. When you optimize for perfection, you're optimizing for comfort. When you optimize for iteration, you're optimizing for truth. 

**15:52**
So the lesson here is to ship messy, right? Get things out there, learn fast, and iterate. My thinking was always: I'm just shipping a product to learn what I should build—the product that I'm supposed to build. 

**16:04**
It's from this level of just learning, iterating, and not being scared to fail that I've been able to go and outpace the competitors in my space because I'm just focused on learning.

**Mechanism 5: Engineer to Scale Beyond You**

**16:12**
Mechanism 5: engineer to scale beyond yourself. Elon doesn't run six companies; he designs operating systems with amazing people in it and he's playing long-term games with the lieutenancy structure inside of these businesses.

**16:25**
People love to point out how Elon runs six companies all at once. It's Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink. But the truth is, in each of these companies, he has lieutenants, right? 

**16:38**
The kind of people that he wants to play long-term games with. An example of this is inside of SpaceX. He has someone named Gwynne Shotwell in place, who he's worked with since 2002. We're talking 23 years of history with someone. 

**16:54**
She started off as an engineer and is now COO of the company and is his lieutenant there that he can trust with all of the core decisions so he can focus on the stuff he loves to do—more of the engineering and design side of it. 

**17:08**
Now you can imagine, right? 23 years of history with someone, right? These days, you know, people are lucky that if you're working with them for eight months, right? People are so transitory and they're hiring someone that they think can last six months and then they're gone.

**17:21**
And you see that there's these revolving doors of talent in so many companies. But imagine, you know, working with people and the average duration being like 10, 15 years. Imagine the chemistry that goes on a team like that. 

**17:34**
Imagine the level of just almost a mind meld across a team and make, you know, decisions almost instantaneously with the whole enterprise and team in mind. There's an illusion that Elon's just running all of this. 

**17:48**
Now yes, he's super involved, but here's the pattern you need to understand: great founders don't centralize power; they distribute effectively to other weapons on their team. 

**17:59**
So how does Elon actually allocate his time across these six companies? He uses a strategy called 5-minute time blocking. So this sounds insane, right? But Elon schedules his entire days in 5-minute blocks. 

**18:11**
Monday, Tuesday is for SpaceX, for things like rocket reviews. Wednesday, Thursday is for Tesla, their production and design reviews. And then Friday is for all the rest of his companies. 

**18:22**
He is ruthless with his calendar. And it's from this ruthless approach to how he's allocating his time that he's able to squeeze so much out of just one hour. Likely getting more done in one hour than most people get done in one week. 

**18:34**
Now I'm not saying you need to go and allocate your day in 5-minute time blocks, but what I AM saying is you need to know what only you can do and then delegate everything else.

**Next Steps and Founder OS**

**18:43**
So here's what happens next. Step one is to go and download the algorithm deletion exercise in the link in the description. From there you're going to go and analyze your company, see the parts that you need to delete, automate, and simplify. 

**18:55**
And then go to step two, which is to hop on a call with my team. We'd love to learn the system that's currently keeping you stuck and help you go and scale to the next level. 

**19:04**
Here's the hard truth: if your business needs you to operate, you don't have a business, you have a job. And at some point you need to decide: are you building a company or are you building a prison? 

**19:13**
And look, if you're sitting here thinking, "you know, Matt, I get it. I need systems, I need help, but I don't know where to start." Well, this is exactly why I built Founder OS. 

**19:23**
We help founders that are established doing 30k to 500k a month go and install the right infrastructure in their company, go and make sure they have the right operating system amongst their team, and help them source amazing talent.

**19:35**
So that over time they can remove themselves from more of the operations, work ON the business not IN it, and have a business that runs itself. If this is interesting to you, you want to work with me one-to-one and directly with my C-suite, go check out Founder OS via link in the description.

### **Organized Notes**

**I. Mechanism 1: Maniacal Sense of Urgency (Principles)**
*   **Timestamp: 00:56 - 04:44**
*   **Definition:** Urgency is about compressing the feedback loop between problem discovery and solution generation.
*   **Decision Velocity:** High performers make decisions with ~80% of data. Most decisions are "two-way doors" (reversible).
*   **Overcoming Timelines:** Don't accept standard timelines; aim for 100x compression (e.g., solving a weeks-long problem in 3 hours).

**II. Mechanism 2: The Algorithm (Operating System)**
*   **Timestamp: 04:45 - 09:22**
*   **The Golden Rule:** Delete and simplify *before* you automate. Automation on top of complexity leads to "production hell."
*   **The 5 Steps:**
    1.  **Question every requirement:** Know the root reason and the specific person suggesting it.
    2.  **Delete parts of the process:** If you can't justify a step, remove it.
    3.  **Simplify what remains:** Avoid over-engineering.
    4.  **Accelerate cycle time:** Compressing months into days for learning agility.
    5.  **Automate last:** Only automate after the first 4 steps are complete.

**III. Mechanism 3: Unreasonable Teams**
*   **Timestamp: 10:05 - 13:17**
*   **Aligned Maniacs:** Hire people obsessed with the mission, not just "culture fit." 
*   **The Breakthrough Mentality:** Great companies are built by "unreasonable" people who optimize for breakthroughs rather than consensus.
*   **Subscribing to Culture:** Use values as uniting principles; Detractors must be removed to maintain alignment.

**IV. Mechanism 4: Iterate at the Speed of Thought**
*   **Timestamp: 13:18 - 16:11**
*   **Learning Velocity:** Failure is a data point. SpaceX succeeds because failure is allowed as a means to gain intelligence.
*   **Iteration vs. Perfectionism:** perfectionism = comfort; iteration = truth. Ship "messy" to learn what to build.

**V. Mechanism 5: Engineer to Scale Beyond Yourself**
*   **Timestamp: 16:12 - 18:42**
*   **Lieutenancy Structure:** Distribute power to long-term partners (e.g., Gwynne Shotwell at SpaceX) to create a "mind meld" team.
*   **Time Management:** Use 5-minute time blocking to maximize hourly output.
*   **Delegation:** Know what only *you* can do and delegate the rest.

**VI. Next Steps**
*   **Timestamp: 18:43 - 20:03**
*   **Founder OS:** A system to help established founders (30k-500k/mo) install infrastructure to work *on* the business rather than *in* it.
*   **Warning:** If the business requires the owner to operate daily, it’s a job/prison, not a company.
