**The Minimum Success Criteria: How to Set Real Goals for Your Startup**

**Introduction: The Pitfall of Long-Term Forecasting**

**00:00**
When pitching your startup idea to key stakeholders like potential co-founders, partners, or investors, you're often asked about your idea's upside potential or how big it could get in five to seven years. This is often an impossible goal to estimate. You either don't know what to say, invent a big goal, or maybe pull out a financial forecast spreadsheet and test your Excel wizardry.

**00:23**
But after all of this, you still end up with a fictional number, which isn't all that believable or helpful. So in this video, I'm going to show you how to create a much more tangible and actionable goal for your startup, which is the first step to securing buy-in from your key stakeholders.

Hi there. If you're new to this channel, my name is Ash Maurya. I'm an entrepreneur and author and the creator of the one-page business modeling tool, Lean Canvas. On this channel, I share systematic strategies and techniques for starting and growing a business.

**The Problem with 5-7 Year Goals**

**00:52**
When pitching your idea to a key stakeholder, you have to simultaneously communicate a big market opportunity while staying grounded in a plan that is both believable and actionable. The problem with five to seven-year goals is that they are too far out into the future and are hard, if not impossible, goals to estimate.

**01:10**
If, for instance, you had asked the Google or Facebook founders when they were first starting out whether they thought they would go on to build billion-dollar companies, they would probably have laughed at you. When interviewed at Harvard during the early days of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg didn't think he was building a billion-dollar company.

**01:27**
He even told the interviewer that he planned on starting a real and very different company after he graduated from university. Yet in just two short years, he turned down an acquisition offer from MySpace for $50 million and over the next several years, he grew Facebook into a unicorn.

**The Google Origin Story and Valuation**

**01:45**
The Google founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, created the PageRank algorithm as part of their PhD at Stanford and reluctantly started the company on the advice of one of their professors, who also was an angel investor in the company and wrote them their first check.

**02:00**
While they launched a very successful search engine that was getting lots of traffic, it wasn't making enough money, and they tried to sell the company to Yahoo!. Do you know what the asking price was? It was just $1 million—not for each founder, but that was the total asking price.

**02:16**
Yahoo! famously turned them down because they had their own search engine, and a few short years later, Google cracked the auction-based ad model, and the rest, as they say, is history.

**The Fog of Uncertainty**

**02:26**
Now, sure, unicorns by definition are rare and hard to foresee at the outset, but even less ambitious outcomes are just as hard to foresee because all startups come enveloped in a thick fog of uncertainty.

**02:39**
This is why I don't recommend starting with some fictional maximum upside potential of your idea, but instead use a more real and tangible minimum success criteria.

**Defining Minimum Success Criteria (MSC)**

**02:50**
Unlike the maximum upside potential, which aims to estimate how big your idea could get in five to seven years, the minimum success criteria aims to estimate the smallest outcome that would deem your project a success just three years from now.

**03:04**
The premise here is that if you're going to commit three years of your life to an idea, it should at least cover your downside and be worth the ride.

**Why a Three-Year Timeline?**

**03:12**
So why just three years? First, because three years is far easier to visualize than five years. While most forecasts ask for five to seven-year exit plans, as we have established already, it's near impossible to see that far. But with just a little effort, you should be able to visualize the first three years of your startup.

**03:31**
Most founders spend Year 1 building and launching their products, Year 2 optimizing their products, and Year 3 is when they start focusing on growth and scaling.

**03:41**
Which brings us to the second reason for three years: three years is usually enough time for most products to achieve product-market fit.

**Product-Market Fit and Growth**

**03:49**
Product-market fit is the inflection point of the hockey stick curve when your product starts delivering repeatable and predictable value to your customers. This is also when you understand your unit economics, and your pricing and business model becomes largely de-risked, and your focus shifts to growth.

**04:05**
That is also when the fog of uncertainty starts to lift, and you're able to see a whole lot further. Yes, this is also the perfect time to start making more tangible five to seven-year financial forecasts that don't rely on fictional numbers and Excel magic.

**Measuring Success with Revenue**

**04:20**
Now, what about the outcome itself? What should you measure here? I recommend framing your outcome in terms of annual revenue versus profit or company valuation or something else.

**04:31**
Profit and valuation are nothing more than derivatives of revenue anyway, so as long as you buffer accordingly, you are covered. For example, if you're building a software business where gross margins at scale are expected to run at 80% or higher, simply adjust your revenue goal with that assumption in mind.

**04:49**
If you're building a physical product with smaller margins of, say, 20%, again, adjust your revenue goal upwards to factor that in.

**Revenue for Impact-Driven Businesses**

**04:57**
How about if you're building an impact-driven business? Even here, I recommend estimating how much revenue you need to generate or raise from impact investors to deliver on your impact goals.

**05:08**
I like to think of the revenue in a business like the oxygen that we breathe. We don't live for oxygen, but we need oxygen to live. The difference between a for-profit business and a not-for-profit business is that a not-for-profit business reinvests excess revenue or profit into delivering more impact. If you want to deliver more impact, you need to generate more revenue.

**Determining the Smallest Successful Outcome**

**05:30**
And now for the trickier question: how do you determine the smallest outcome that would deem your project a success in three years? You might be surprised by this response, but most minimum outcomes are already set for you, either based on your internal ambition or operating environment.

**05:47**
I start by asking yourself if you're planning on raising money from investors. If the answer is yes, then your minimum success criteria isn't really set by you but by your future investors. When the time comes, investors put their money into ideas that stand to give them the biggest return on their investment.

**06:04**
So it would be prudent to study how your target investors currently value companies at product-market fit. That will give you some specific benchmarks to use in your own modeling.

**Bootstrap Goals and Lifestyle Businesses**

**06:14**
Now, if you don't intend to raise money from investors and bootstrap all the way instead, ask yourself:
1. How big a company you'd like to build?
2. How many employees and what kind of a company vibe or lifestyle you want?
The answers to these questions can help ballpark your target revenue and minimum success criteria goal.

**Using Fermi Estimates and Powers of Ten**

**06:32**
Now, your minimum success criteria can be a deep "why" question, and the key at this stage is not to overthink this step. You don't need to pull out a spreadsheet and come up with a three-digit precise number. The purpose of this exercise is ballparking a rough estimate.

**06:47**
This is where it's helpful to use Fermi values or think in terms of orders of magnitude or powers of 10. When you use power of 10 estimates for your minimum success criteria, you find that there are only four possible successful outcomes or startup games worth playing in any startup.

**The Four Levels of Startup Success**

**07:05**
You can either build a Level 1 business, which is a $100K a year business. This is roughly enough to quit your day job and run a solopreneur-type business. You could build a Level 2 business, which is a $1M a year business. This is often a small three to ten-person company.

**07:21**
You can aim to build a Level 3 business, which is a $10M a year business. This is where you don't have to raise funding, but your options open up if you want to go the VC route. And finally, you could aim to build a Level 4 business, which is a $100M a year business or a unicorn.

**Understanding Value Ranges**

**07:38**
Now, it's important to point out that when you use Fermi or power of 10 values, these numbers are not absolute numbers but rather ranges of possible values. So a $100,000 a year business does not have to exactly make $100,000 in a given year.

**07:53**
Making anywhere between $60,000 to, say, $400,000 would still classify as a Level 1 business. Similarly, making $500,000 to up to $4 million a year would classify as a Level 2 business.

**Conclusion: Picking and Playing Your Game**

**08:07**
The other point worth emphasizing here is that there is no right or wrong answer. Your minimum success criteria can only be determined by you, as you are investor number one in your business. And it should be hopefully clear by now that there isn't just one way to win as a founder.

**08:24**
You get to pick the game you want to play, but you must pick a game to play it well because each game requires different rules, tactics, and strategies to win. If you have a founding team, I recommend that you ensure they are all signed up to play the same game as you are.

**08:39**
This simple step will improve clarity, focus, and avoid misexpectations and painful regrets later. Many founders start with an idea and then wait to see how big it can get over time, which is often a recipe for unexpected bad surprises or disappointments.

**08:55**
Flipping the order is a proactive way of ensuring you're not disappointed in the outcome. Start with your minimum success criteria and then find an idea to meet your goal.



**Notes**

**Pitching and Goal Setting**
* **00:00** – Avoid the trap of "fictional" 5-7 year upside potential. It’s hard to estimate and often unbelievable.
* **02:50** – Focus on **Minimum Success Criteria (MSC)**: the smallest outcome that makes the project a success after 3 years.

**The 3-Year Timeline Strategy**
* **03:12** – Why 3 years? It's easier to visualize than 5+ years.
* **03:31** – Standard Startup Lifecycle: 
    * Year 1: Build/Launch.
    * Year 2: Optimize.
    * Year 3: Scale.
* **03:49** – 3 years is the timeframe for achieving **Product-Market Fit**, the point where the "fog of uncertainty" lifts.

**Measuring the Right Metrics**
* **04:20** – Measure **Annual Revenue**, not just profit or valuation. Profit and valuation are derivatives of revenue.
* **05:08** – Revenue is like "oxygen"—essential for survival and impact, regardless of being for-profit or non-profit.

**The Four Levels of Startup Outcomes (Fermi Estimates)**
* **06:47** – Use "Powers of 10" to ballpark success levels rather than precise spreadsheets:
    * **Level 1 ($100K/yr):** Solopreneur/Self-sustaining.
    * **Level 2 ($1M/yr):** Small team (3-10 people).
    * **Level 3 ($10M/yr):** Significant business; VC optional.
    * **Level 4 ($100M/yr):** Unicorn/VC-scale.

**Founding Principles**
* **08:24** – Align the entire founding team on the "level" of game being played to avoid future conflict.
* **08:55** – **Order of operations:** Define your MSC first, then find the idea that matches those goals.
