**Top 10 (Un)Common Sense Startup Maxims**

**Introduction: Uncommon Sense in Investing and Startups**

**00:00**
Charlie Munger famously said that when people use the word "common sense" in investing, what they really mean is "uncommon sense." The same is true in startups where it's easy to find a bunch of seemingly common-sensical first principles that often go ignored because founders don't really understand them. 

**00:17**
In this video, I'm going to share my top 10 uncommon sense startup maxims and highlight the most misunderstood bits in each of them. So let's dive in. Hi there, if you're new to this channel, my name is Ash Maurya. I'm an entrepreneur and author and the creator of the popular one-page business modeling tool, Lean Canvas. On this channel, I share systematic strategies and techniques for starting and growing a business.

**Maxim 1: Love the Problem, Not Your Solution**

**00:40**
Let me kick things off with uncommon sense maxim number one: Love the problem, not your solution. The top reason why products fail is building something nobody wants. Why does this happen? I attribute this to something I call the Innovator's Bias, where entrepreneurs prematurely fall in love with their solutions. 

**01:00**
When they get hit with an idea, they either rush to build out their solution or rush to secure resources to build out their solution. But customers don't really care about your solution; they care about their problems. Problems, not solutions, create spaces for innovation. 

**01:12**
When you start with a solution, it's like building a key without a door. You then have to face the challenge of figuring out what door to open. This is the classic solution-looking-for-a-problem challenge. A better alternative is switching perspectives. 

**01:28**
When you start with problems before solutions:
1. You first identify what door you want to open.
2. Then key building or solution building becomes a whole lot easier.

**Maxim 2: Solve Problems Customers are Currently Trying to Solve**

**01:37**
While starting with problems before solutions is a simple concept, many founders fail to identify the right problem because of uncommon sense maxim number two: Solve problems customers are currently trying to solve. 

**01:51**
This one seems obvious, right? Of course, you should solve problems customers care about, but here's where most founders get it wrong. They either subconsciously invent or make up problems, or they run a bunch of surveys where they ask people a bunch of leading or hypothetical questions like, "Do you have this problem?" or "Will you use my solution?" 

**02:11**
These types of questions only serve to confirm or justify the solution they already wanted to build in the first place. The misstep here is interpreting a false-positive for validation. 

**02:23**
Also, since many startup founders believe they are building new category-defining products, they often fall into another trap of trying to solve problems customers don't even know they have. While it may sound visionary to create needs customers don't know exist, it's incredibly difficult and expensive. 

**02:40**
Most startups don't have the resources or runway to educate a market. So instead, focus on solving problems customers already know they have and have tried solving themselves.

**Maxim 3: Chase Problems Worth Solving**

**02:51**
While starting with problems before solutions is the first step, not all problems are created equal, which brings us to uncommon sense maxim number three. You need to ensure that you chase problems worth solving. Some problems are simply not worth solving, at least not as a business. 

**03:09**
A problem worth solving needs to meet three criteria:
* Customers know they have it.
* Customers want it solved.
* Customers are willing to pay to solve it.

**03:18**
That last point is crucial. I've seen many startups solve genuine problems that customers simply weren't willing to pay for. The best evidence of a problem worth solving is that people are already spending money to solve it with existing alternatives. 

**03:32**
Before you invest time building a solution, verify that the problem is worth solving by understanding how customers currently address it. Are they currently spending money, time, or effort? If not, you might be chasing a problem that isn't worth solving as a business.

**Maxim 4: The True Product is a Business Model**

**03:47**
The reason this distinction between problems and problems worth solving is critical is because of uncommon sense maxim number four: The true product of an entrepreneur is a business model, not a solution. 

**03:59**
While building a great solution is key, it's only one piece in the jigsaw puzzle you need to put together as a founder to build a great business. It helps to think of your true product as a business model. 

**04:11**
Thinking of your business model as a product is particularly empowering because if you already know and love to build products, you can apply the same thinking processes to building business models that you already do with building great products. 

**04:24**
For instance, the first step when taking on any complex product is to design a simple model or blueprint. This is where business modeling tools like the Lean Canvas come in. 

**04:34**
A Lean Canvas helps you deconstruct any big idea into a set of key assumptions to create a simple business model that describes how your business works. This is the first step in distilling clarity.

**Maxim 5: Stress-Test Your Business Model Before Testing It**

**04:46**
The next step, also taken from the product development playbook, is uncommon sense maxim number five: Stress-test your business model before testing it. This one surprises people. Don't you need to test your business model to know if it works? Yes, of course you do, but not right away. 

**05:02**
Much like architects first stress-test their building designs before starting construction, you can stress-test business models before building out your product. Testing a business model takes time and effort, and the real danger here is executing a flawed model and getting stuck in a suboptimal business or a zombie startup. 

**05:21**
A zombie startup is neither dead nor alive, and it's a fate that can be far worse than a failed product because of sunk and switching costs. The good news is that most zombie startups can be completely avoided with a bit of business model stress-testing. 

**05:36**
Stress-tests are run inside the building. They use thought experiments and simulations to identify and correct obvious cracks or flaws in your business model during the design stage. 

**05:49**
I test all my ideas against seven factors:
1. Mission
2. Clarity
3. Viability
4. Desirability
5. Feasibility
6. Defensibility
7. Timing

**06:04**
Now passing all these stress-tests doesn't guarantee success, but it does guarantee not going down many dead-end alleys. I've saved countless founders months of wasted effort by having them first stress-test and bulletproof their business models against these obvious pitfalls.

**Maxim 6: Prioritize Testing Your Riskiest Assumptions**

**06:18**
Once you have stress-tested your business model, you are then ready to start testing your business model, which brings us to the next uncommon sense maxim: Prioritize testing your riskiest, not easiest, assumptions. 

**06:33**
If you were building a complex technical product under a tight deadline, you wouldn't start with the easy stuff because you can do that at any time. You would start with what's riskiest. We often forget this when building a startup. 

**06:45**
Many founders start with building a solution because of their Innovator's Bias, but that usually isn't what's riskiest. Given enough time, money, and effort, we can build almost anything these days. What's truly riskiest are typically things like customer and market risks. That is: Will anyone care? And will they pay for it?

**Maxim 7: Demo-Sell-Build versus Build-Demo-Sell**

**07:05**
So it should naturally follow that before attempting to spend weeks or months building something, you should validate demand and willingness to pay first, which brings us to uncommon sense maxim number seven: Demo-Sell-Build versus Build-Demo-Sell. 

**07:19**
This is perhaps the most counterintuitive maxim on the list. The traditional product development path is: build your product, demo it to customers, then try to sell it. But this approach is backwards and risky. 

**07:30**
You invest months or years building something before you know if anyone will buy it. The more smarter approach is:
1. Demo your concept using mockups, prototypes, or even just a conversation.
2. Sell it—in other words, get commitments, pre-orders, or letters of intent.
3. Then and only then build it, knowing you already have customers waiting.

**07:51**
This doesn't mean you sell vaporware. It means you validate demand before investing in supply. If you can't sell the demo, why build the product? I've used this approach dozens of times myself and helped hundreds of founders do the same. This tactic isn't just limited to B2C or digital products; it works just as well with high-ticket B2B and physical products.

**Maxim 8: Talk to Customers, Not Users**

**08:12**
Let's move on to the next maxim: Talk to customers, not users. There's a fundamental difference between customers and users. Customers pay you money; users don't. 

**08:22**
Many founders proudly tell me they have thousands of users, but when I ask how many customers they have, the number drops dramatically. And here's the misstep: they spend more time talking to users hoping to convert them into customers, but the real insights for how to create more customers come from customers, not users. 

**08:41**
In other words, all feedback is not created equal. Free users will ask for everything under the sun; paying customers will tell you what's actually important. If you want more customers, talk to customers, not users.

**Maxim 9: Chase Failures for Explanations**

**08:53**
Uncommon sense maxim number nine: Chase failures, or unexpected outcomes, for explanations. Most people run away from failure; successful entrepreneurs chase them, not because they enjoy failing, but because unexpected outcomes are the source of breakthrough insights. 

**09:09**
When an experiment doesn't work as expected, most founders either ignore the results or give up entirely. But the real gold is in understanding why things didn't work as expected. 

**09:20**
The common theme across all these breakthrough discoveries listed here:
* Microwave
* X-ray
* Plastics
* Google's auction-based ad system
* Slack
* PayPal

**09:31**
...is that they all started as failed experiments. In each of these cases, the inventors or founders were seeking a specific outcome or business result and instead got a very different outcome. But instead of throwing away their failed experiments, they did something very different from most people: they asked why. 

**09:49**
Achieving a breakthrough is less about luck and more about a rigorous search. The key is having the discipline to chase explanations for unexpected outcomes rather than simply moving on to the next idea. This is how real breakthrough happens. 

**10:03**
Now I know there's a lot of taboo around failure in many cultures, and so I'll make one suggestion here that has greatly helped me personally. Replace the word "failure" in your vocabulary with "unexpected outcomes." There is no such thing as a failed experiment, only unexpected outcomes. 

**10:20**
Then, when you encounter an unexpected outcome, train yourself to be naturally curious and chase "why."

**Maxim 10: Focus on Repeatability Before Scalability**

**10:25**
And the final uncommon sense maxim is number 10: Focus on repeatability before scalability. Too many founders are in a rush to get to the right side of the hockey stick curve. They do this by trying to go fast on everything, but when you go fast on everything, it doesn't necessarily make you go faster and it's often a recipe for just getting lost faster and focusing on the wrong things at the wrong time. 

**10:49**
Premature optimization is one of the top startup killers because you can't scale something that isn't first repeatable. Repeatability here means:
* That you can consistently acquire customers.
* You can reliably deliver value.
* And that your unit economics are starting to work.

**11:05**
The best part is that you don't need thousands or millions of users to establish repeatability. I've seen too many founders raise millions in funding and hire dozens of employees before they've figured out a repeatable business model. The results are almost always painful and expensive. Repeatability, then, is a prerequisite for scalability.

**Bonus Maxim: Just Start**

**11:25**
Now since this video is about uncommon sense, here's one more bonus maxim: Just start. Perfect idea not required. We have been taught to prepare: prepare for the test, prepare for the big trip, prepare for the next project. Our natural tendency is to apply the same thinking to our ideas. 

**11:41**
When we get hit with an idea, or in preparation for getting hit with the right idea, we try to find the perfect time to act, the perfect book to read, or the perfect course to take. But entrepreneurship and startups are different. 

**11:53**
Riddled with extreme uncertainty, new ideas have no perfect time, perfect book, or perfect course that can fully prepare you to act. You have to take a leap and just start. So if you've been waiting to start, just start. 

**12:07**

### **Organized Notes**

#### **The Core Philosophy**
*   **[00:00] Uncommon Sense:** Startups require "uncommon sense"—first principles that seem logical but are frequently misunderstood or ignored by founders.

#### **I. Product-Market Strategy Maxims**
*   **Maxim 1: Love the Problem, Not Your Solution [00:40]**
    *   **The Problem:** Founders suffer from "Innovator's Bias," falling in love with their product before confirming it solves a real need.
    *   **The Key:** Solutions are "keys"; problems are "doors." You must find the door first to ensure the key is useful.
*   **Maxim 2: Solve Problems Customers are Currently Solving [01:37]**
    *   **The Misstep:** Founders invent problems or rely on hypothetical survey answers (false-positives).
    *   **The Solution:** Focus on issues customers already recognize and are actively trying to fix. Education of a market is too expensive for most startups.
*   **Maxim 3: Chase Problems Worth Solving [02:51]**
    *   **Criteria for Success:** Customers must (1) know the problem exists, (2) want it solved, and (3) be willing to pay.
    *   **Evidence:** The best proof is current spending (money/time) on existing alternatives.

#### **II. Business Model Design & Validation**
*   **Maxim 4: The True Product is a Business Model [03:47]**
    *   **Reframing:** Your job isn't just to build a product, but a sustainable business model. Use blueprints like the **Lean Canvas** to deconstruct assumptions.
*   **Maxim 5: Stress-Test Before Testing [04:46]**
    *   **Why:** Testing in the market is expensive. Stress-testing identifies flaws early to avoid "zombie startups" (businesses that are neither dead nor growing).
    *   **Seven Factors [05:49]:** Mission, Clarity, Viability, Desirability, Feasibility, Defensibility, and Timing.
*   **Maxim 6: Prioritize Riskiest Assumptions [06:18]**
    *   **Risk Hierarchy:** Technical feasibility is rarely the biggest risk. The biggest risks are usually "Customer Risk" and "Market Risk."
*   **Maxim 7: Demo-Sell-Build [07:05]**
    *   **Strategy:** Flip the traditional model. Use mockups to get commitments/pre-orders *before* writing code or manufacturing. Validate demand before investing in supply.

#### **III. Growth & Optimization Mindset**
*   **Maxim 8: Talk to Customers, Not Users [08:12]**
    *   **Distinction:** Customers pay; users don't. Insights for scale come from those willing to invest in the solution. Free users often provide distracting, low-value feedback.
*   **Maxim 9: Chase Failures for Explanations [08:53]**
    *   **Reframing Failure:** View failure as an "unexpected outcome." Breakthroughs (like PayPal or Slack) often come from asking "why" an experiment didn't go as planned.
*   **Maxim 10: Repeatability Before Scalability [10:25]**
    *   **The Danger:** Premature optimization and scaling a broken model lead to expensive failure.
    *   **Repeatability Checklist [10:56]:** Consistent customer acquisition, reliable value delivery, and working unit economics.

#### **Conclusion**
*   **Bonus Maxim: Just Start [11:25]**
    *   **Over-Preparation:** Startups have too much uncertainty for perfect preparation. Action is the only way to gain real data.
