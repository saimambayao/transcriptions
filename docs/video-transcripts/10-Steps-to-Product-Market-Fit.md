**Verbatim Transcript: 10 Steps to Product/Market Fit**

**Introduction: The Author and the Reality of Success**

**00:01**
Hi, this is Ash with Spark59. A number of you probably know me as the author of Running Lean, but by way of introduction, I’d like to say that I’m first and foremost an entrepreneur. I love entrepreneurs, so I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this is the sad reality: 9 out of 10 products fail. 

**00:16**
The more interesting statistic though is that the companies that succeed report having drastically changed their plans along the way. So what that tells us is that what separates successful entrepreneurs from those that don't quite make it is not necessarily starting with that perfect Plan A or that perfect vision, but finding a plan that works before running out of resources. 

**00:40**
Running Lean is a systematic process for iterating from Plan A to a plan that works before running out of resources. Today though, I’d like to focus on what it means to get to that plan that works, in other words, what it means to get to Product/Market Fit and how you might navigate your way to get there.

**What is Product/Market Fit?**

**00:53**
So let’s start with the definition. Even though Marc Andreessen didn’t coin the term Product/Market Fit, he helped popularize the term in a blog post where he described what Product/Market Fit felt like: customers are buying the product just as fast as you can make it, or usage is growing just as fast as you can add servers. 

**01:08**
In other words, this is when the hockey stick curve begins to take off. The problem with this definition is that while it tells you what Product/Market Fit feels like, it doesn't tell you how to get there. As a result, getting to Product/Market Fit is often seen more as a black art or a function of luck, but there is a lot more science to it.

**01:26**
You can navigate the path to Product/Market Fit systematically, which is what I’m going to be talking about today. This talk is going to be organized around three learning milestones or stages, and we’re going to walk through each one. 

**Stage 1: Problem/Solution Fit**

**01:40**
The first stage is Problem/Solution Fit. Before you get caught up in building and optimizing your product, you can take a number of steps to maximize your odds of building a successful product. The fundamental question to ask yourself at this stage is whether you have a problem worth solving in the first place. 

**01:58**
The way you do this is by first documenting your Plan A or initial vision. You have to draw a line in the sand. The reason this is important is because as entrepreneurs, we are especially gifted at creating reality distortion fields around ourselves and rationalizing anything, good or bad, to fit what we believe. 

**02:18**
While passion and determination are important, left unchecked they can lead to blind faith. A Lean Startup is rooted in the scientific method where we strive to replace blind faith with facts and take a more empirical approach. Traditionally, business plans have been used for this purpose, for documenting our most critical assumptions. 

**02:39**
In a room full of people, I often ask the question: how many people have written a business plan before? And a number of hands go up. I then ask: how many people enjoyed that process? And most, not all but most, of the hands go back down. Writing a business plan is a good exercise for the entrepreneur. 

**02:53**
The problem is that the people who make you write it, typically investors, they themselves don’t take the time to read the entire business plan. Instead, they ask for the one-page executive summary, or the 10-page slide deck, or the 30-second elevator pitch. 

**03:10**
If you’re going to have to shorten it to such a concise form, why don’t you start with something like that in the first place, especially since the business plan is going to change anyway over time? Remember that most startups end up drastically changing their initial vision anyway, so why start with something that’s going to take a lot of time to write? 

**03:29**
The business model in comparison is a single diagram that captures your most critical assumptions around your business on a single one-page document. This is the Lean Canvas format that I created, which is a derivative work off of the original Business Model Canvas created by Alexander Osterwalder.

**03:47**
For those of you that have written business plans before, you will recognize a lot of these building blocks on the canvas. Things like problem, solution, unfair advantage—these are typically what would go on your business plan, except you’re not writing a 60-page document to capture those things, instead you’re putting it on a single page. 

**04:03**
It makes the document a lot more portable, a lot quicker to create, and most importantly, it creates an opportunity to have conversations with people other than yourself. Whether these are internal team members, your advisors, your advisors, your investors—to me, that is the key aspect of writing a business model: to be able to share it with other people. 

**04:21**
Use that conversation to be able to identify what’s riskiest in your business model. From a risk perspective, the biggest risks initially lie in the customer segment and problem boxes. If you don’t understand customers and their problems, you can’t build the right solution for them, and everything else on the canvas falls apart. 

**05:04**
This is why I push entrepreneurs to start with this quadrant in their initial testing. Once you have a good enough problem and customer segment understanding, you can then start formulating the first version of your solution, or what in the lean sense we’d call a Minimum Viable Product. 

**Stage 2: Early Traction**

**05:22**
You are then ready to move into the second stage, Early Traction. The key question in this stage is asking whether you have built something that enough people want. From a risk perspective at this stage, aspects of your product like your solution, unique value proposition, and pricing are probably most important.

**05:37**
This stage is more about learning versus optimization. Pricing is a good way to illustrate this distinction. I consider revenue streams as one of the riskier aspects of your product. If you find out later that customers won’t pay for your product, that can be fatal for your business model. 

**05:56**
That’s why I advocate charging for your product from day one versus hiding behind an alpha or beta product excuse. At this stage, I am also more interested in testing that people will actually pay something than trying to find out that optimal price. Testing that people will pay is a learning goal; finding the optimal price is an optimization goal better saved until the next stage. 

**Stage 3: Product/Market Fit and Scalability**

**06:18**
Now once you have enough people using your product, your focus then shifts to the final stage, Product/Market Fit. The key question here is scalability: how do I accelerate growth? The first step here is identifying your key Engine of Growth. 

**06:51**
Engine of Growth is a term Eric Ries defined in his book *The Lean Startup*, where he describes three engines that startups use to create sustainable growth. Let’s see how they map out on the customer lifecycle. The first engine of growth is the Paid Engine of Growth. Here, you’re trying to improve acquisition at the top of the funnel.

**07:15**
For this to be sustainable, you have to be able to acquire customers at a cost that is less than the lifetime value of those customers. Typically you use things like advertising or direct sales force, but even things like social media, which seem like free channels, end up being paid channels because they require a lot of human capital to be able to put them together.

**07:35**
The second engine of growth uses the Retention trigger. Here, we try to improve retention, we try to improve the lifetime value of customers by extending the time with which they use our products. So we make them more sticky and hence the name. The final engine of growth is the Viral Engine of Growth. 

**07:53**
Here we’re using the referral trigger to use our happy customers that have gone down the funnel to be able to add more users at the top of the funnel through the referrals that they create. It is possible for more than one of these engines of growth to apply to your startup, but in order to maximize return on your effort, you need to focus on one primary engine of growth at a time. 

**MVP and Early Customer Learning**

**08:11**
An MVP is the smallest solution that delivers customer value and ideally also captures customer value. An MVP is not your final solution, but rather the smallest solution you can build that delivers customer value and ideally captures some of that customer value. This is just a fancy way of saying that if you intend to charge for your product, I believe you should start charging from day one. 

**08:58**
Because pricing is typically one of those riskier components in your business model. As you add more customers, measuring progress actually becomes increasingly harder, not easier. In the good old early days when you had just a handful of customers, it was easy to correlate observed results to actions because you knew all your customers. 

**09:43**
But now not only do you have a lot more customers to track, but you’re also continuously pushing more features and running a lot more marketing campaigns. And don't forget that other people are doing these things for you now as well. It becomes way harder to derive cause and effect from the various activities and know which ones are really working.

**Innovation Accounting and Pirate Metrics**

**10:04**
The first step here is creating a standardized measure of progress. Much like we have financial statements like balance sheets and income statements to measure established companies, we need a set of standard metrics to measure startups. At Spark59, we standardize our measure of progress around five macro metrics first described by Dave McClure as Pirate Metrics. 

**10:39**
At its core, it captures the complete customer lifecycle, going from acquiring an unaware visitor all the way down to creating happy, paying, and passionate customers. The goal during this stage is getting enough customers through the complete lifecycle. The focus should be on delivering value first, not growth. 

**10:58**
If you can’t repeatedly deliver value to customers, trying to add more users to the top of the funnel is simply a form of waste. So let’s see which metrics qualify as value metrics. There are two metrics that typically stand out as being particularly important. The first low-hanging fruit is Activation. If you don't deliver a great first experience, the user will probably leave and not come back.

**11:24**
The second key metric is Retention, which measures repeated use of your product, which is a strong indicator that you are continually delivering value. I marked Revenue here as optional because, first, it doesn't apply to all products—for example, multi-sided products that use advertising don't charge their users—and second, it’s not as important as retention at this stage. 

**11:45**
If you’re charging for your product, retention and revenue should mirror each other quite well. Since you don't have lots of customers yet, learning at this stage ends up being a lot more qualitative than quantitative. This often makes entrepreneurs nervous because it doesn't seem like the learning is statistically significant. 

**12:02**
When I tell people they should focus on first getting just 10 customers through the funnel, they often tell me that they are building a product for tens of thousands of customers and don't think 10 customers would be statistically significant as a test. What I tell them is that if they can’t even get 10 hand-picked customers—typically early adopters—through the funnel, adding more users at the top is not going to change things. 

**12:26**
Being able to count your customers on your fingertips is actually a gift. At this stage, you don’t need any fancy analytics tool. Even though we are building a fancy tool of our own, we use a Trello board to visualize all our early customers like this.

**Cohort Analysis and Correlation**

**12:42**
The reason correlation gets harder is that the further down the funnel you go, the more interesting customer events like revenue get time-shifted. You can see that here with the blue dots. The people who sign up today are time-shifted to when they activate and are further time-shifted to when they actually upgrade and pay for your service. 

**13:31**
This makes it very hard to track what you might do at the signup stage all the way down through the customer lifecycle. What cohorts essentially do is they help you group your customers and keep these blue dots together. By being able to isolate the complete lifecycle as a cohort, you can more rigorously measure if you’re improving your product on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. 

**Feedback Loops and Failed Experiments**

**13:53**
Another problem with relying on just metrics is that they can tell you what is going wrong but not why. You can try to guess at what is going wrong and attempt to fix it, but there’s an even better way: building a continuous feedback loop with your customers and having them tell you, which you can use for rapid hypothesis generation on what might be going wrong. 

**14:15**
Here’s a screenshot of how we do this. This is an activation sub-funnel from one of our products. On the left-hand side, you can see the sub-funnel and the drop-offs across all the steps. Now I can use this to try to guess what might be going wrong, but the right-hand side is where the real action is. This shows me all the people that are going through this funnel. 

**14:31**
I can not only see the people who successfully complete the funnel, but those that don’t. I have their names and their email addresses. I can reach out to them and ask them what might be going wrong. Now at this stage, because we have so many customers, this becomes hard to do manually over time, and so we actually built a way to automate this. 

**14:54**
This email alone generates 20 to 30 emails a day from our customers that continually keeps us informed on what kinds of issues they are running into. It allows us to create new features and new ideas, which we then test and measure in just the same way. 

**The Journey and the True Pivot**

**15:12**
And the last point I want to make is a big one. The journey to Product/Market Fit is going to be riddled with a lot of experiment failures. Now when experiments fail, many entrepreneurs are quick to run away from that failure and change direction drastically, justifying it as a pivot. Unfortunately, the word pivot has become an excuse and an overly abused Lean Startup term. 

**15:34**
A pivot represents a change in strategy and needs to be grounded in learning. If it’s not grounded in learning, it’s just a disguised see what sticks strategy, which is not an optimal way to get to Product/Market Fit. There’s a reason that the hockey stick curve is largely flat at the beginning. 

**15:50**
It’s not because the founders were too dumb or not working hard enough, but rather that before you can find a business model that works, you have to go through a lot of stuff that doesn't. The answer is in running away from failed experiments, but rather digging deeper. Taking the time to uncover the root cause of these failures is where you’ll find the real breakthrough insights.

### Organized Notes: 10 Steps to Product/Market Fit

**The High Failure Rate of Startups (00:01 - 00:27)**
*   **Statistic:** 9 out of 10 products and startups fail.
*   **The Secret to Success:** Successful companies drastically change their plans. Success is defined as finding a plan that works before running out of resources (money, time, passion).
*   **Core Principle:** What differentiates those who succeed is the ability to navigate uncertainty and find a working business model systematically.

**Defining Product/Market Fit (00:53 - 01:25)**
*   **Feeling PMF:** Marc Andreessen describes it as growth so fast you can't keep up (servers crashing, sales exploding).
*   **The Problem:** Describing the feeling doesn't provide a path to achievement.
*   **Science over Luck:** PMF is not just luck or "black art"; it can be reached via systematic learning milestones.

**The Systematic Journey to PMF: 3 Stages (01:26 - 06:17)**
*   **Stage 1: Problem/Solution Fit (01:40 - 05:21)**
    *   **The Question:** "Do I have a problem worth solving?"
    *   **Action:** Document your initial vision (Plan A) using a **Lean Canvas** (one-page business model).
    *   **Reality Check:** Entrepreneurs are prone to "reality distortion fields." Use the scientific method (facts over blind faith).
    *   **Risk Identification:** Initially, the biggest risks are the Customer Segment and the Problem.
*   **Stage 2: Early Traction (05:22 - 06:17)**
    *   **The Question:** "Have I built something people want?"
    *   **Action:** Build a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**.
    *   **Value Before Growth:** Focus on satisfying hand-picked customers (early adopters) rather than mass growth. satisfy 10 hand-picked customers before scaling.
*   **Stage 3: Product/Market Fit (06:18 - 06:50)**
    *   **The Question:** "How do I accelerate growth?"
    *   **Action:** Focus on scalability and identifying your core growth engine.

**Standardized Metrics and Accounting (10:04 - 11:44)**
*   **Innovation Accounting:** Startups need a standardized measure of progress analogous to financial balance sheets.
*   **Pirate Metrics (AARRR):** Standardized framework by Dave McClure:
    1.  **Acquisition:** How users find you.
    2.  **Activation:** The first great experience.
    3.  **Retention:** Users coming back (the key indicator of value).
    4.  **Revenue:** Users paying (mirror of retention).
    5.  **Referral:** Users telling others.

**Engines of Growth (06:51 - 08:10 & 13:03 - 14:23)**
*   **Paid Engine:** Acquisition via advertising or sales (sustainable if LTV > CAC).
*   **Sticky Engine:** Growth through improved retention and lifetime value.
*   **Viral Engine:** Growth through user-to-user referrals.
*   **Focus:** Pick one primary engine to maximize returns.

**Managing Complexity and Tracking Progress (12:26 - 15:11)**
*   **Small Scale Advantage:** Being able to count customers on your fingers allows for high qualitative learning. Tools like **Trello** are sufficient at this stage.
*   **Correlation Challenges:** As users increase, it's harder to tie actions to results.
*   **Cohort Analysis:** Groups customers by time to rigorously measure if product updates are actually improving performance across the lifecycle.
*   **Feedback Loops:** Metrics show *what* is wrong; continuous feedback loops (like automated surveys) show *why* it's happening.

**Failed Experiments and the True Pivot (15:12 - 16:11)**
*   **Failure is Expected:** The path to PMF is full of failures.
*   **Pivot Definition:** A change in strategy grounded in learning. Without learning, a pivot is just a "see what sticks" strategy.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Real breakthrough insights are found by digging into why an experiment failed, rather than running away from it. The early "flat" growth curve is where this deep work occurs.
