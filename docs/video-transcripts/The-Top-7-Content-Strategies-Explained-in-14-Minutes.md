**7 Content Strategies that are Dominating in 2026**

**Introduction: The Old Way is Dead**

**00:00**
The old way of creating content is dead.

**00:03**
If you want to create content that actually grows audiences, builds authority, and drives real business results, you need to know what's actually working right now.

**00:11**
I've spent the last decade helping brands make millions through content. Right now, I'm watching 90% of people waste their time on strategies that stopped working years ago.

**00:22**
So these are the seven content strategies that are dominating and how to use them to get ahead of everyone else.

**Strategy 1: Create Content for AI**

**00:29**
The first strategy is something that most people have no idea about and would probably even disagree with. You need to start creating content for AI.

**00:38**
People who win in the content space understand that content isn't just for humans anymore; it's also for AI.

**00:45**
When someone comes to me saying they've been posting consistently for a year with zero results, I ask them, "Are you creating content where AI can actually find it?"

**00:56**
And they look confused, so I explain: Wikipedia, Reddit, and YouTube are now the primary sources that ChatGPT, Perplexity, and every major AI platform is pulling from.

**01:08**
This is called A.E.O.: Ask Engine Optimization.

**01:13**
If your ideal customer is using AI to research solutions—and they are—and you're not showing up in those sources, you literally don't exist to them.

**01:22**
So imagine you're investing heavily in, you know, a LinkedIn content strategy because you know your audience is technically on LinkedIn.

**01:31**
But then you use a tool like SparkToro to check where that audience is actually consuming information and getting answers.

**01:40**
And you find out that most of your prospects are finding solutions through YouTube tutorials and industry-specific Reddit discussions. You have been talking to the wrong room this entire time.

**01:52**
Every hour you spend creating content for a platform where your audience is not actively searching is an hour your competitor is spending on the platform where they are.

**02:03**
To fix that, you should use SparkToro to find where your prospects actually consume content right now. Audit every channel you're currently on and ask these things:
1. Is AI indexing this? 
2. Are my prospects searching here?

**02:16**
And if the answer is no to both, cut it.

**02:19**
Prioritize the intersection of what AI cares about and where your audience lives.

**Strategy 2: Think in Messages, Not Funnels**

**02:26**
The second strategy will completely change how you think. Think in messages, not in funnels.

**02:34**
The old way of marketing is broken. Here is what will work in 2026 and beyond.

**02:39**
Most people in marketing or business learn about the funnel diagram. And if you're not familiar, it's this idea that you create different types of content for different stages in a customer's lifetime.

**02:50**
So, top-of-funnel content to build awareness, middle-of-funnel to nurture interest, and bottom-of-funnel to basically close the sale.

**02:58**
For a content creator, that might mean viral shorts at the top, education videos in the middle, and your course pitch at the bottom.

**03:06**
But here is the problem: people don't follow your funnel. They follow their own often chaotic-feeling path.

**03:11**
They can land on your homepage from Google, ready to buy, but all of your best content is buried because you organized it by funnel stage instead of by what message they actually need in that moment.

**03:23**
The message-driven approach flips this. You map the specific messages your audience needs to hear in order, regardless of where they encounter your content.

**03:34**
If your content doesn't stand alone and deliver value regardless of where someone finds it, you are losing people.

**03:42**
So I teach people to map the messages your audience needs to hear:
* What problem do they need you to understand?
* What or who do they blame?
* What failed solutions must they acknowledge before they can move forward?

**03:55**
For example, if someone discovers you through a random YouTube video, that video should communicate your authority and your unique perspective instead of just catering to a specific phase of their journey.

**04:08**
Make every message accessible everywhere based on what serves your audience.

**Strategy 3: Start with Problem Match**

**04:15**
The next strategy is to start with what I call problem match. If you want to sell more, stop pitching and start mirroring. This is the mistake I see more than any other.

**04:25**
Imagine this: a homepage that opens with credentials, years of experience, impressive results, and all the accolades.

**04:32**
Technically impressive, but with no explanation of the problem the prospects are going through and how to solve it.

**04:39**
Now imagine that same page rewritten to start with: your growth has stalled, you're working harder than ever but your profits aren't growing, your team is burned out, and you don't know what to change first.

**04:51**
Same business, but now the person thinks, "Okay, this brand gets it. They understand what I'm going through."

**04:58**
For a content creator, this might be starting your video with, "You've been creating content for months and nobody's watching," instead of "Hi, I'm a content strategist with 500,000 subscribers."

**05:08**
Before you can sell a solution or build an audience, you have to prove you understand the specific problem your audience is facing in their exact language with their exact pain points. That is problem matching.

**05:24**
And it's essential for getting people to say yes to you and your services because if you skip problem matching, everything else you say just sounds like noise.

**05:34**
So use your audience's exact language, not corporate speak or even expert jargon. If they say "overwhelmed," don't say "resource allocation challenges."

**05:44**
Make problem match the first thing in every piece of content. So if you're a fitness creator, open with "You're tired of workout plans that don't fit your schedule," not "Welcome to my channel where I post five workouts a week."

**05:57**
Then test your problem statement with someone in your target audience and refine it until they go, "Yes, exactly, exactly that."

**Strategy 4: Build Your Mega Mean Mouse**

**06:05**
Okay, let's dive into strategy number four, which separates amateur content from pro content. This is what we call building your mega mean mouse.

**06:15**
There's an old saying in direct response copywriting, and it is: don't sell a better mousetrap, sell a bigger, scarier mouse.

**06:23**
And if you're not familiar, it just means people don't buy because your solution is, you know, 40% faster; they buy because their current problem is killing them and everything they've tried has failed.

**06:34**
Now, here is the difference. Most people selling project management software, for example, focus on features—you've got a Gantt chart, time tracking, and all of these integrations. This is generic and frankly not that compelling.

**06:48**
But if you build the mega mean mouse and you show prospects their chaotic approach is costing them 20 hours a week, burning out their team causing missed deadlines that damage client relationships, suddenly people are paying attention.

**07:02**
So for a content creator, instead of "I'll teach you better video editing," you say, "Your current editing workflow is taking six hours per video when it should take two, and that's costing you thousands in lost opportunities."

**07:15**
See, your prospect, the world, is already numb to "better." Everyone claims to be better, faster, cheaper.

**07:22**
But pain, fear, the realization that their situation is worse than they thought—that breaks through. That makes someone stop and think, "Ooh, this is me, like I need to pay attention."

**07:33**
If your content doesn't agitate the problem before presenting the solution, it won't work.

**07:38**
So here is how to tackle this: identify the core problem that you solve, then expand on it.
1. What downstream effects are they ignoring? 
2. What happens in 6 to 12 months if this remains unresolved?

**07:50**
Find your villain—it's not a person—try instead to blame like the old way, the broken system, the industry standard that's failing the prospect.

**08:00**
For example, a productivity coach might blame "the hustle culture myth" that's burning you out, rather than blaming the person.

**08:08**
Show the failed solutions and why those didn't work. Make the mouse bigger before you ever mention your mousetrap.

**Strategy 5: "Blank for Blank" Positioning**

**08:16**
This next strategy might seem too simple, but it's where most businesses completely fall apart. It is "blank for blank" positioning.

**08:25**
If I asked you right now to tell me what you're known for in one sentence, could you do it? Most people can't, and that's the problem.

**08:34**
If you're not familiar with "blank for blank" positioning, it is the simplest formula in the marketing world: the "what you do" for "who you serve."
* The project management tool for creative teams.
* The hair growth serum for perimenopausal women.

**08:48**
Here's why this works. If someone asks what you do and you say, "We help businesses with their digital transformation," they nod politely, but they have no idea if you're relevant to them. Are you for enterprise or startups? Healthcare or manufacturing?

**09:04**
Now imagine instead that you say, "Oh, we're the digital transformation consultancy for family-owned manufacturers."

**09:11**
Still a lot of jargon in there, but instantly a family-owned manufacturer knows that you're for them. Everyone else knows, "Oh, it's not for me."

**09:19**
And that clarity is absolute power. For a content creator, this might be "the YouTube growth strategist for personal finance creators," instead of "I help people grow on YouTube."

**09:29**
Without very clear positioning, your content just tries to speak to everyone and ends up speaking to no one; you are generic and forgettable. And we can fix that.

**09:41**
When you nail "blank for blank," your content has teeth. You're not just another option; you are the option for a specific group with a specific need.

**09:50**
You stop competing with 10,000 brands and start competing with maybe five.

**09:56**
Start with what you do in simple terms. Then get specific on who it's for. So, not just businesses but creative agencies or remote teams based in Pakistan.

**10:06**
Then combine them: "the [what you do] for [specific who]."

**10:10**
Test it. Can someone immediately know if they're your customer? If they hesitate, you're too broad; go more narrow.

**10:17**
For example, "the meal prep coach for busy moms who hate cooking" is so much clearer than "I teach healthy eating."

**10:24**
Put this positioning everywhere: your homepage, your bio, every piece of content.

**Strategy 6: Make Content Personality-Driven**

**10:29**
Here's strategy number six, and it might be the most important. Make your content personality-driven, not product-driven.

**10:38**
The more your content sounds like a product, the less anyone believes it.

**10:42**
I see this constantly: a CEO tells me they don't want to be on camera because they're not comfortable or not polished enough.

**10:49**
Meanwhile, their competitors are on LinkedIn and YouTube every week, showing their face, sharing opinions, telling stories about what they've learned over time.

**10:59**
Guess who's winning. The one willing to be a person with a real personality and opinions.

**11:05**
There's a reason people like Dan Martell have massive audiences in the educational content space. It's not because his products or services are necessarily better—love you, Dan—it's because he consistently shows up like a real person.

**11:20**
This is good for brands. For content creators, this means showing your actual process, your mistakes, your behind-the-scenes, not just these polished, perfect final results.

**11:32**
Trust is the currency of modern business and you cannot build trust with faceless corporate content or overly polished perfection.

**11:42**
When people can see who you are, hear how you think, and understand your perspective, they start to feel like they know you. And people do business with people they know and like.

**11:54**
Stop trying to be perfect. People relate to real, not polished. Share first-person stories about what you learned the hard way and the mistakes you made.

**12:04**
For example, instead of "Five tips for productivity," try "I wasted three years on productivity systems that failed; here's what actually worked." That is how you build a point of view that people care about.

**Strategy 7: Quality over Frequency**

**12:17**
This last one goes against everything you've been taught about content strategy. Prioritize quality over frequency.

**12:26**
Every content guru tells you to post every day, stay consistent, show up no matter what. But posting less could actually get you better results.

**12:34**
Here's what most people don't understand about algorithms. They're not counting how many times you post; they are measuring how many people care when you post.

**12:44**
I had a client posting on Instagram 16 times a day because some well-intentioned course told her that's what you're supposed to do.

**12:51**
Her engagement was terrible. The algorithm saw spam and then de-prioritized everything that she posted.

**12:59**
That's what happens when you prioritize frequency over quality. You're not building an audience; you're training the algorithm to ignore you.

**13:08**
Every platform—YouTube, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok—has what's called a golden hour. It is the first 60 minutes after you hit publish.

**13:17**
What happens in that golden hour tells the algorithm whether your content is worth showing to more people.

**13:24**
If you post and immediately get comments, likes, and shares, obviously the algorithm is like, "Okay, this is valuable; show it to more people."

**13:31**
But if you post and crickets, the algorithm says, "Nobody cares; de-prioritize this creator and their videos."

**13:40**
Stop posting to meet arbitrary quotas. Only post when you have something genuinely valuable. And when you do post, clear 60 minutes to respond to every comment.

**13:52**
Show the algorithm that your content matters. Build a small group who will engage in that golden hour.

**14:00**
Remember, a YouTube creator posting one well-researched video per week with strong engagement will outperform someone posting daily with no comments.

**Conclusion: Stop Chasing Originality**

**14:10**
Those were the seven content strategies that can level up your brand or business better than anyone else. But there's still something holding your brand back that can make these strategies ineffective, and it's this: chasing original ideas.

### **Organized Notes**

**7 Content Strategies for 2026**

**1. Create Content for AI (A.E.O.) [00:29]**
*   **Concept:** Focus on "Ask Engine Optimization."
*   **Action:** Post on platforms AI uses as primary sources: Wikipedia, Reddit, and YouTube.
*   **Tool:** Use SparkToro to find where your audience is actively searching.

**2. Think in Messages, Not Funnels [02:26]**
*   **Concept:** Disregard the linear "Top/Middle/Bottom" funnel. Customers find content chaotically.
*   **Action:** Create content that delivers value as a standalone message, regardless of when or where it is found.

**3. Start with Problem Match [04:15]**
*   **Concept:** Mirror the audience's pain points instead of pitching your credentials.
*   **Action:** Use the audience's exact language and pain points in your hooks.
*   **Refinement:** Refine statements until target users say, "Exactly that."

**4. Build Your Mega Mean Mouse [06:05]**
*   **Concept:** Don't sell a "better mousetrap" (solution); sell a "bigger mouse" (the severity of the problem).
*   **Action:** Agitate the problem and its long-term consequences before presenting your solution.
*   **Target:** Focus on the pain and fear of the current situation.

**5. "Blank for Blank" Positioning [08:16]**
*   **Concept:** Use the formula "[What you do] for [Specific who]."
*   **Action:** Narrow your niche to stop competing with broad brands. Clarity is power.
*   **Placement:** Use this sentence in bios, homepages, and every piece of content.

**6. Personality-Driven Content [10:29]**
*   **Concept:** Modern business runs on trust, which requires a human face.
*   **Action:** Show your process, mistakes, and behind-the-scenes. Be a real person with opinions.

**7. Quality over Frequency [12:17]**
*   **Concept:** Algorithms measure engagement (who cares), not frequency (how often you post).
*   **Action:** Focus on the "Golden Hour" (first 60 minutes). Respond to every comment to signal value to the algorithm. Stop posting for arbitrary quotas.
