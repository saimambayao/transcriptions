**The Evolution of Building Fast: From Vibe Coding to Vibe Startups**

**00:00**
2025 was the year of vibe coding. Developers typed vibes into Cursor, Claude Code, or Lovable. AI wrote the code; product shipped in hours, not months, and everyone celebrated. Product development is finally solved. But here's what nobody saw coming: building fast is only half the equation. The killer combo isn't just building fast but also building and learning fast. And that's what 2026 unlocks.

**00:26**
I call this Vibe Startup. Not because it uses AI to just code faster, but because it also uses AI to validate faster. In the next 12 minutes, I'll show you why a 75-year-old framework just became your new startup competitive advantage and how AI finally makes lean startup principles work at the speed of thought.

**00:46**
So here's what happened last month. I'm in a Zoom call with a founder. He had been building a B2B scheduling tool for six months. Then he found Cursor and rebuilt the whole thing in three weeks. It had a beautiful interface, clean code, but zero customers. Does that sound familiar?

**01:07**
That founder discovered what many other founders are learning right now: AI made building fast, but it didn't make building the right product any easier. The problem is that we are still thinking with the old paradigm.

**01:16**
Before AI: Building was slow. So we validated first. We had to.
After AI: Building is fast. So we skip validation because we think we can.

**01:28**
And that's the trap. It's creating a new category of zombie startups: built in days, dead in weeks. And here's what's really interesting: that same AI that's creating this problem is also the solution.

**Historical Context: The PDCA Cycle**

**01:43**
Let me explain by taking you back to 1950. W. Edwards Deming introduces the PDCA, or Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle, to Japanese manufacturing. It became the foundation for continuous improvement and sparks lean thinking and the Toyota Production System.

**01:57**
Fast forward to 2009: Eric Ries reframes PDCA as Build-Measure-Learn for software startups, which sparks the Lean Startup movement. Same cycle, new language.

**02:10**
But here's what both Deming and Eric understood: the goal isn't to move through the cycle once; it's to accelerate how fast you can iterate. Deming wanted faster manufacturing improvements; Eric wanted faster product iterations. And in 2026? We want faster business model iterations or validation cycles.

**How the PDCA Works**

**02:29**
So how does the PDCA work?
1. You PLAN an experiment.
2. You DO or run the experiment.
3. You CHECK the results.
4. And finally, you ACT on what you learned.

**02:39**
And that fuels the learning flywheel. It's simple, proven, and time-tested. The problem is that each cycle took weeks and sometimes even months to run.

**02:47**
It typically took:
* Two weeks to plan or design an experiment.
* Two weeks to build the test.
* One or two weeks to analyze results.
* One week to then decide on next steps.

**02:58**
That's six to seven weeks per cycle. At that rate, maybe you'd run eight to ten cycles per year if you were disciplined. Most founders, on the other hand, just run two or three cycles, getting impatient, and then revert back to just building.

**03:11**
Why? Because running good validation cycles is hard work and requires discipline. It also feels always like you're going slower when you could just be building instead. But 2026 changes the math completely.

**03:24**
AI, or more specifically AI agents, thrive on learning feedback cycles like PDCA, where they can continuously run in a loop to hit a specific goal. It's what powers coding agents and what I believe will also power a new breed of startup agents.

**03:43**
With such a startup agent, you would be able to:
* Plan in hours versus weeks: designing experiments, writing interview scripts, and creating test scenarios.
* Do or run experiments in days versus weeks: building landing pages, demos, and prototypes.

**03:57**
* Check or measure those results in real time in hours versus days: by analyzing interview scripts or metrics on a landing page, looking for patterns, and surfacing actionable insights.
* And finally, you'd be able to use all this data to then act and make good decisions in real time.

**04:16**
It's not impossible to shrink validation cycles from what used to take six to eight weeks down to a single week. Think of it: that's six to eight times faster. You can now run 50 plus validation cycles in the same time it took you to run eight. The constraint has just shifted. Building is no longer the bottleneck; thinking is. And that's where vibe startups come in.

**Defining the Vibe Startup Framework**

**04:40**
A Vibe Startup isn't about typing vibes into Cursor and hoping for the best. It's about using AI to compress the validation cycle so fast that you can test your way to product-market fit before running out of runway. And here's the framework.

**04:55**
Step 1: Vibe the Problem. Instead of building a solution, you vibe the problem space first. AI can help you research the market, formulate a starting business model, and even stress-test it for you.

**05:08**
When it comes to validation, AI will not automatically build landing pages out of nowhere or conduct customer interviews for you. It instead can use your input assumptions to build better pages and help you prepare better questions, analyze responses in real time, and identify key patterns. You can do what used to take weeks to do in just hours.

**05:29**
Step 2: Vibe the Solution. This is where vibe coding shines, but with a twist. A lot of people try to one-shot a fully working product, but at this step, you're not building the full product but rather a demo or prototype.

**05:43**
The goal here isn't building a working product but rather testing if it's the right product in the first place by using a demo-sell-build approach. Remember, if you can't sell the demo, why build the product? You won't be able to sell that either.

**05:58**
And this is where you can go really fast. You can build good landing pages in 20 minutes, clickable prototypes in hours, and a good working demo in a day or two.

**06:08**
And then you move on to Step 3: Vibe the Metrics. This is where I think AI shines the brightest. You're not analyzing and drowning in tons of data; you're having AI find patterns that you would otherwise miss.

**06:21**
Upload 10 customer interviews and AI can identify the common objections and patterns in minutes versus hours or days. You can use AI to track leading indicators, not just lagging ones—things like signup flow drop-offs, feature usage patterns, or email open sequences—and surface what really matters the most on any given moment.

**06:41**
This is the check step where you measure what's actually working, but now you can do this step in hours versus the days or weeks that it used to take.

**06:51**
And finally, the feedback loop. Step 4: Vibe the Learning. This is where you turn your learnings into key insights which fuel the next actions or experiments that you run.

**07:00**
This is the key step that creates a learning flywheel that typically starts slow at the beginning when you're just starting out, but speeds up with learning. The faster it starts to spin, the faster you grow your startup.

**Case Study: LeanSpark**

**07:13**
Now let me show you all this in action. Take LeanSpark, the AI co-founder I'm building right now. I could have spent six months building a comprehensive AI course, video lessons, interactive exercises, a certification workshop—the whole thing. Instead, I applied the Vibe Startup framework.

**07:30**
Step 1, where I vibed the problem. I used AI to analyze 200 plus founder interviews from my business model design cohorts. I used that to find patterns across thousands of conversations I've had with founders to uncover what they were really struggling with.

**07:47**
It wasn't "I need AI," but rather "I don't have the time or confidence yet to apply what I've been learning." Then I talked to 15 founders to understand the problem even deeper.

**07:58**
Many founders were solo founders that I spoke with and would love to have a co-founder or hire a coach. That was their real struggle: someone they could talk to to clarify their thinking and help guide them through their specific situation. But hiring a startup coach can cost $5,000 to $10,000 and most early-stage founders can't yet afford that.

**08:18**
That's when I moved to Step 2: Vibe the Solution. I didn't build out a full solution; instead, I prototyped just one workflow: a 90-day startup playbook built on past workshops and coaching programs I had already run.

**08:34**
I then moved to Step number 3: Vibe the Metrics. Instead of waiting to finish a polished product, I launched a demo-sell-build campaign with a few screenshots of what I was building and started taking pre-orders for a product that didn't yet exist.

**08:48**
In 40 days, I had 246 pre-orders booked and over $50,000 in revenue. Now that's not luck; that's demand validation.

**08:58**
This led to Step number 4: Vibing the Learning. Instead of locking myself in the metaphorical garage and building in stealth, I instead continuously shipped demos and talked to pre-order customers. I kept learning and refining exactly what needed to be built in the MVP.

**09:15**
This led to many little pivots and course corrections along the way. And the key here is that these weren't just led by guesses that I had, hoping what customers or people would want; rather, they came straight from the customers themselves. That's a key difference between vibe coding and vibe startups.

**Conclusion and Recommendations**

**09:33**
Now, what makes vibe startups really powerful is that the constraint just shifted. Before AI, the constraint was building, so we optimized for validation. After AI, the constraint is thinking, so we need to optimize for learning.

**09:47**
In 2025, founders used AI to build faster, but they still failed at the same rate. In 2026, founders will use AI to learn faster, and my bet is that they'll succeed at higher rates. That's at least the promise.

**10:01**
So where do you start?
1. First, stop thinking of AI as just a coding tool; start thinking of it as a validation engine.
2. Second, compress your PDCA cycles or feedback loop. If your validating experiments are taking more than a week, you're probably moving too slow.

**10:17**
3. Third, use AI to multiply your learning, not just your building. Every experiment should teach you something. AI can help you learn 10 times faster.
4. And four, stay disciplined. Just because you can build in three days doesn't mean you should; always start by validating first.

**10:35**
The founders who win in 2026 won't be the ones who just build 10 times faster; they'll be the ones who also learn 10 times faster. Becoming a 100x founder is the opportunity here.

**10:48**
If you want to speed up your validation velocity, you should check out LeanSpark. I built LeanSpark, an AI co-founder that runs through the systematic validation using the exact PDCA framework I just showed you.

**10:59**
It's not generic ChatGPT prompts, but rather structured sprints with proven lean frameworks. And this isn't just theory; I'm using LeanSpark to validate LeanSpark—it's very meta, I know.

**11:11**
I already shared the results earlier: 246 founders pre-ordered in 40 weeks, $50,000 plus in revenue before the product was even built. And that's an example of the system working.

**11:25**
Right now, I'm running the January 2026 cohort with the first group of founders. If you want in, there's a link in the description below. Thanks for watching and here's to your success in 2026. Until next time, take care.

### **Notes**

**I. Introduction: The Shift from 2025 to 2026**
*   **[00:00]** 2025 was defined by "vibe coding" (using AI to code and ship in hours).
*   **[00:15]** The Problem: Building fast is only half the battle. High-speed building without high-speed learning leads to products with no customers.
*   **[00:26]** **Vibe Startup Concept:** Using AI not just to code, but to **validate** ideas faster.

**II. The Current "Zombie Startup" Trap**
*   **[00:46]** Example: A founder rebuilt a 6-month project in 3 weeks using AI but still had zero customers.
*   **[01:07]** AI makes building easy, but it doesn't automatically mean you are building the *right* thing.
*   **[01:16]** **The New Paradigm:** Before AI, slow building forced validation. Now, fast building tempts founders to skip validation, leading to "Zombie Startups" (built fast, die fast).

**III. Historical Context of Iteration**
*   **[01:43]** **1950 (PDCA):** W. Edwards Deming introduced Plan-Do-Check-Act to manufacturing (Lean thinking).
*   **[01:57]** **2009 (Build-Measure-Learn):** Eric Ries adapted PDCA for startups.
*   **[02:10]** The core goal has always been iteration speed. In 2026, the focus is on **validation speed**.

**IV. The Math of AI-Accelerated Validation**
*   **[02:47]** **Old Cycle (6-7 weeks):** Planning (2w), Building (2w), Analyzing (1-2w), Deciding (1w).
*   **[03:21]** **The 2026 Shift:** AI agents can compress this into **one week**.
*   **[03:42]** **AI-Driven PDCA:**
    *   **Plan:** AI writes interview scripts and test scenarios (hours).
    *   **Do:** AI builds landing pages and prototypes (days).
    *   **Check:** AI identifies patterns in customer data/interviews (hours).
    *   **Act:** Founder makes data-driven decisions in real time.
*   **[04:35]** **The Bottleneck Shift:** Building is no longer the bottleneck; **thinking** is.

**V. The Vibe Startup Framework (4 Steps)**
*   **[04:55] Step 1: Vibe the Problem.** Use AI to research markets and stress-test business models before building.
*   **[05:29] Step 2: Vibe the Solution.** Focus on "Demo-Sell-Build." Use AI to build prototypes and landing pages quickly. If you can't sell the demo, don't build the product.
*   **[06:10] Step 3: Vibe the Metrics.** Use AI to find patterns in qualitative data (e.g., 10 interviews analyzed in minutes) and track leading indicators.
*   **[06:52] Step 4: Vibe the Learning.** Turn results into insights to fuel the "Learning Flywheel."

**VI. Case Study: LeanSpark**
*   **[07:13]** Ash Maurya used this framework for LeanSpark instead of spending 6 months building a course.
*   **[07:30]** Analyzed 200+ interviews to find the real pain point: founders wanted a "co-founder/coach" but couldn't afford one.
*   **[08:34]** Result: $50k in revenue and 246 pre-orders in 40 days for a product that didn't exist yet.

**VII. Key Takeaways for Founders**
*   **[10:01] Advice:**
    1.  Treat AI as a **validation engine**, not just a coding tool.
    2.  Compress feedback loops to under a week.
    3.  Multiply learning speed.
    4.  Stay disciplined—**validate first**, even if building is fast.
