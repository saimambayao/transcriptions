**The 7 Costliest Mistakes First-Time Founders Make**

**Introduction: The Concept of Asymmetric Risk**

**00:00**
Startups are inherently risky and can easily consume years of your life. For the journey to be worthwhile, you have to chase asymmetric risks where the potential upside of your startup is much greater than the potential downside.

**00:14**
It's not enough to simply aim for a 1x or 2x return on your salary. You have to think a lot bigger and aim for a 10x return while ruthlessly eliminating your downside.

**00:25**
So in this video, I'm going to share my top seven costliest mistakes that first-time founders make so you can actively reduce your downside while swinging for the fences. 

**00:36**
Hi there, if you're new to this channel, my name is Ash Maurya. I'm an entrepreneur and author and the creator of the popular one-page business modeling tool, Lean Canvas. On this channel, I share systematic strategies and techniques for launching and growing a startup.

**Mistake 7: Quitting Your Day Job to Work on a Startup**

**00:49**
So coming in at number seven is quitting your day job to work on your startup. There's this myth that you have to just believe in your idea strongly enough and take a leap of faith. 

**01:01**
But quitting your day job as soon as you get hit with an idea is like jumping off a cliff with no parachute and no safety net. Even professional trapeze artists don't just leap into the air; they first practice with safety nets and wires. 

**01:16**
Professional or serial startup entrepreneurs are no different. The reality is that many successful ideas can and do start as side projects and with the right tools and knowledge, it is possible to first sufficiently de-risk any idea before deciding to go all in.

**01:33**
For me, that is achieving problem/solution fit with an idea. I consider problem/solution fit to be the first significant milestone of a startup idea, and it's when you go from hoping people will buy your product to confidently knowing that they will.

**01:48**
With the right tools and knowledge, it is possible to achieve problem/solution fit with any idea irrespective of what solution you're building in just 90 days and working part-time, 10 to 15 hours a week. 

**02:01**
Until you can demonstrate problem/solution fit, I find that quitting your day job or going full-time on any idea just doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

**Mistake 6: First Building a Working Product**

**02:10**
The main reason founders think they need to quit their day job is because of reason number six. They think they need to first build a working product, and this too is a false belief. 

**02:21**
In a study on startup failure, most of the founders who failed didn't fail because they failed to build the product they set out to build; they failed because they built something that no one or not enough people wanted. 

**02:34**
In other words, given enough time, money, and effort, we can build almost anything these days. The bigger question is: will anyone care? 
* Customer and market risks are much riskier than technical or feasibility risks.

**02:46**
Now it's common to think that the only way to test customer and market risks is with a working product, but this too isn't true. Customers first buy a promise of something better. 

**02:58**
A promise can be delivered through an ad or a landing page or if you are even in an enterprise setting, through an email, phone call, on LinkedIn, or a webinar. 

**03:06**
If this promise of better earns their attention, they might then ask for a demo and if that checks out, they then ask for pricing or to start a pilot. Nowhere in these steps do you need a working product. 

**03:19**
If you can't grab sufficient customer attention with your promise, you don't get to show them a demo, and if you don't show them a demo, you don't make a sale. So it should logically follow that until you can sell your demo, why bother building a product?

**03:33**
I call this tactic Demo-Sell-Build versus Build-Demo-Sell and it's a huge shortcut that significantly de-risks the downside of you wasting needless time, money, and effort only to build something nobody wants.

**Mistake 5: Premature Fundraising (or Joining an Accelerator)**

**03:46**
The other costly distraction or trap that founders fall into is number five: Premature fundraising or joining an accelerator. 

**03:56**
Because the cost of building products is at an all-time low, investors today don't typically invest in an idea or a working product, but rather traction. 

**04:05**
You'll have a much higher chance of grabbing an investor's attention with a pipeline of customers that want to buy your product once it's built versus trying to convince them to give you money to build your product so you can attract customer interest. 

**04:19**
And so until you have some demonstrable traction, why bother wasting precious time chasing investors? The bigger subtext here is that:
1. You may not even need investors in the first place if you can get to traction and customer revenues on your own.
2. Not all ideas require investment, especially VC investment.

**04:41**
Every year I meet hundreds of founders in startup accelerators with uninvestable ideas. They had no problem getting into these accelerators; their problem is getting out. 

**04:52**
These founders would be much more successful if they focused instead on bootstrapping and acquiring customers versus doing what everyone else is doing: joining accelerators and chasing investors.

**Mistake 4: Public Launch**

**05:03**
Okay, so let's move a little further down the timeline. Assuming you have a product or MVP built, the next costly mistake I often see is pursuing a public launch. 

**05:14**
Public launches consume a lot of resources and a common trap here is falling into the premature optimization trap. This is where it's easy to over-index on scaling needs, whether it's investing on more servers or marketing campaigns or ads. 

**05:30**
We're often told to "Go big or go home" and this too is just bad advice. Every hockey stick starts out with a long flat curve, not because the founders don't want to grow fast, but because they have to go through lots of stuff that doesn't work before they find what does.

**05:47**
A better mindset here is: "Deliver value or go home." And value delivery doesn't need to start with hundreds or even thousands of customers; just 10 carefully selected initial customers will do. 

**06:00**
The logic here is that if you can't deliver value to just 10 carefully picked, hand-selected customers, what makes you think you can deliver value to hundreds or thousands of customers on your own?

**06:11**
Now if delivering value to 10 customers is easy, then don't just stay there. Turn your attention to 10x-ing that to a hundred customers and then to a thousand. 

**06:20**
I call this tactic a 10x Product Launch and I prefer it to public launches because it helps you play the hockey stick in stages versus letting the hockey stick play you and whiplash you around.

**Mistake 3: Starting with a Freemium Model**

**06:31**
The next costly mistake along the same lines is number three: Starting with a freemium model. 

**06:37**
The thinking here goes that when launching a new product, it's often a good idea to give away your product for free so that:
1. You can learn from users.
2. You can get them to try before they buy.
3. Setting pricing then based on what users would be willing to pay.

**06:53**
While sound in theory, things seldom work this way in practice because again, most first launches typically miss the mark. 

**07:01**
When users encounter a half-baked product, they don't give you feedback; instead, they ghost you and leave. Without user feedback, there is no true learning, just guessing—which is a recipe in my opinion for going around in circles.

**07:15**
And more importantly, pricing is one of the more riskier parts of a working business model. It separates users from customers, and it's not really your customer's job to set pricing—that's your job. 

**07:27**
So finally, what I'll say here is that charging from day one extends your runway, which is why I'm a big fan of starting with premium before freemium.

**Mistake 2: Going Too Broad**

**07:37**
A closely related motivation for doing public launches and starting with freemium is reason number two, which is: Going too broad. 

**07:46**
In order to pursue a large market, which is what we're again told to do, a common mistake is to think that your product should be for everybody. But when you try to market your product to everyone, you end up reaching nobody. 

**07:59**
While all companies at scale address many different customer segments, we have to remember that they all started with a much smaller and focused early adopter segment. 

**08:09**
Before Facebook opened their social network to the public, they built much smaller networks on college campuses and their first initial early adopters were college students on just one campus: Harvard. 

**08:20**
Apple's early adopters were creative professionals like graphic designers and publishers, while Microsoft's early adopters were largely business users and hobbyist programmers. 

**08:29**
Early adopters have above average motivation to use your product and so the logic here is that if you can't deliver value to them, it will be much harder to deliver value to other types of customers. 

**08:41**
Early adopters also tend to be less price-sensitive than mainstream customers, and so it's also easier to start with premium before freemium with them.

**Mistake 1: Falling in Love with Your Solution**

**08:50**
This brings me to my number one costliest mistake, which is at the root of many of the other mistakes I've covered so far. Number one: Falling in love with your solution. 

**09:00**
We entrepreneurs are naturally wired to think in terms of solutions, but for all the reasons above, starting with a solution no matter how easy it initially seems, often consumes more time, money, and effort than we originally estimate.

**09:14**
But the real kicker is that it's also usually not what's riskiest in a startup. After years of building what I thought were awesome technical solutions that didn't turn into awesome working business models, I switched my focus to chasing problems worth solving. 

**09:29**
And solution building got a whole lot easier and a whole lot more rewarding in exchange. Problems, not solutions, create new spaces for innovation, and not all problems are created equal. 

**09:40**
Going back to my earlier recommendation, finding problem/solution fit ideally before you build your solution is the key to drastically reducing your downside while searching for the biggest possible upside or biggest problem worth solving.

**09:54**
All you need is 10 to 15 hours a week and 90 days to achieve problem/solution fit. I've built a set of guided playbooks for new founders that walks through all the steps.

### **Notes**

**The Concept of Asymmetric Risk [00:00]**
*   Startups are risky; ensure the potential upside far outweighs the downside.
*   Aim for 10x returns rather than small salary-replacement increments.

**Mistake 7: Quitting Your Day Job [00:49]**

**Mistake 6: First Building a Working Product [02:10]**
*   The primary risk is market risk (does anyone want it?), not technical risk (can we build it?).
*   Strategy: **Demo-Sell-Build**. Sell the promise first via ads or landing pages to validate demand before writing code.

**Mistake 5: Premature Fundraising [03:46]**
*   Investors fund traction, not just ideas.
*   Focus on bootstrapping and customer acquisition first.
*   Raising money too early can lead to being stuck with an uninvestable idea in an accelerator.

**Mistake 4: Public Launch [05:03]**
*   Avoid "Premature Optimization." Don't scale until you've proven value.
*   Mindset: **Deliver Value or Go Home**.
*   Start with just 10 hand-selected customers. Use a **10x Product Launch** (scaling in stages: 10 to 100 to 1000).

**Mistake 3: Starting with a Freemium Model [06:31]**
*   Free products often fail to generate honest feedback (users just ghost).
*   Pricing is your job to set; charging from day one extends your runway.

**Mistake 2: Going Too Broad [07:37]**
*   Marketing to "everyone" often results in reaching "nobody."
*   Start with a narrow **Early Adopter** segment (e.g., Facebook at Harvard, Apple for creative pros).
*   Early adopters are more motivated and less price-sensitive.

**Mistake 1: Falling in Love with Your Solution [08:50]**
*   This is the root of most startup failures.
*   Focus instead on **Problems Worth Solving**.
*   Problems create the space for innovation. Achieving Problem/Solution Fit is the goal.

**The 90-Day Challenge [09:54]**
*   You can validate an idea and reach Problem/Solution Fit in 90 days with minimal weekly commitment.
