**Introduction: Launching a Startup in 2026**

**00:00**
If you want to launch a startup in 2026, my hope is that this video might save you months or years of wasted effort.

**00:06**
I've watched the same mistakes kill startups over and over after coaching thousands of founders across dozens of different business models.

**00:14**
In this video, I'll share 10 harsh lessons with the exact frameworks to avoid them. No sugar coating, just the brutal reality I wish someone had told me before my first startup. So let's dive in.

**Lesson 1: Your Idea Doesn't Matter, Your Business Model Does**

**00:26**
Lesson number one: Your idea doesn't matter, your business model does.

**00:31**
I can't tell you how many times I've heard, "I have the perfect product idea." But the harsh truth is that most product ideas are worthless.

**00:39**
I've seen brilliant product ideas fail because the business model was broken, and I've seen mediocre product ideas succeed because the business model was sound.

**00:48**
Your idea is just a starting point. Your business model is what actually matters.

**00:54**
The framework to avoid this pitfall is: Don't just start with a product idea or even a Lean Canvas for your product idea. Start with Business Model Design.

**01:03**
Ask yourself:
1. What's the real problem I'm solving?
2. Who's affected?
3. How much do they currently pay?
4. What's your unique value proposition or promise?
5. What's your unfair advantage or moat?
6. Can this be repeatably scalable?

**01:18**
There's quite a bit here, which can be overwhelming. The good news, of course, is that you don't have to tackle all the right answers at the outset to get started.

**01:28**
But you should know the right questions to be systematically asking yourself along the way.

**01:33**
Now, most founders skip this step and then wonder why their perfect idea fails months down the road.

**01:38**
Ideas themselves are cheap; business models that work repeatably and scalably is the real work here.

**Lesson 2: Building First is Backwards (Think Demo-Sell-Build)**

**01:45**
Lesson number two: Building first is backwards. Think Demo-Sell-Build.

**01:50**
Most founders think the path is: Build, then Launch, then Sell. But that's costly, risky, and frankly, backwards.

**01:57**
The better path is Demo-Sell-Build.

**02:01**
Now, if you're a regular to this channel, you know I constantly harp about Demo-Sell-Build versus Build-Demo-Sell. And there are probably a dozen videos here on this channel with many different concrete examples ranging from B2B to B2C products.

**02:15**
Yet, after each and every video, there are still always a few comments at the bottom of the video to the effect of: "This will never work for us because we are different."

**02:25**
Now, the harsh reality here is that you're not really all that different. I've seen this work across every product category imaginable.

**02:32**
Every product in the world needs to be sold, and most sales don't need a working product, but a good demo to make the sale.

**02:40**
If someone won't buy your demo, they definitely will not buy your product. So why not start with the demo?

**02:47**
The framework to avoid this pitfall is taking a traction-first versus a build-first approach.

**02:52**
Because remember, if you can't sell the demo, you won't be able to sell the product.

**Lesson 3: 90% of Validation Fails Because You Asked the Wrong Question**

**02:57**
Lesson number three: 90% of validation fails because you asked the wrong question.

**03:03**
The most common validation questions I see founders using in their conversations with customers are asking things like, "Would you use this?" or "Will you pay for this?"

**03:13**
These questions kill startups. Everyone says yes to these kinds of hypothetical questions because it costs them nothing.

**03:21**
Here's what actually works: Instead of "Would you use this?", you should ask, "Will you pre-order this?"

**03:26**
Do you see the difference? One is future-based; the other requires commitment in the present.

**03:31**
The framework here to avoid this pitfall is: Don't measure what customers say; always measure what they do.

**03:38**
If 10 people say, "I'd probably use that," but zero are going to pre-order, you have zero validation.

**03:44**
Customer actions always speak louder than their words.

**Lesson 4: Your First 10 Customers Should Look Nothing Like Your Next 1000**

**03:48**
Lesson number four: Your first 10 customers should look nothing like your next 1,000.

**03:54**
This one cost me nine months with one of my early products. I had built a general-purpose file-sharing product.

**03:59**
Users loved it and gave glowing testimonials, and so I doubled down and built tons of more features that they were requesting.

**04:07**
After nine months, I ended up with thousands of free users that weren't buying anything.

**04:12**
Why? Because I had been targeting and listening to the wrong early adopters.

**04:18**
Lots of founders think that chasing more free users will help you build a better product faster, and so they pursue things like freemium.

**04:26**
The harsh reality is that freemium is not a business model but a marketing tactic—one you can experiment with later down the road, but it's not the best tactic to use when you're just launching a new product.

**04:39**
In my case, I decided to focus on the much smaller minority of paying customers and learned that what they wanted was quite different from what my non-paying users wanted.

**04:50**
I saved this product by getting rid of freemium in the short term and pivoting and growing this early adopter segment from there.

**04:57**
The framework here to avoid this is carefully handpicking your first 10 early adopters and charging from day one.

**05:04**
If you can't deliver and capture value back from your 10 carefully picked early adopters, you won't be able to do this with hundreds or thousands of random users.

**Lesson 5: Revenue Solves Most Problems (Funding Creates New Ones)**

**05:14**
Lesson number five: Revenue solves most problems; funding creates new ones.

**05:19**
Everyone wants to raise money. VC funding seems like the goal. Here's what they don't tell you:

**05:24**
Your first $1,000 in revenue teaches you more than $2 million in funding.

**05:30**
Why? Because earning revenue forces you to solve real customer problems, while funding only sometimes delays that reality.

**05:39**
The framework I recommend here to all founders is to bootstrap your way to at least your first 10 paying customers, then decide if you need funding at all.

**05:48**
And before you think this is impossible for your product, remember lesson number two: You can apply Demo-Sell-Build to do this.

**05:56**
Customer funding is much, much greater than investor funding.

**05:59**
When customers pay:
* You validate your model.
* You learn what works.
* You maintain control.
* You build sustainably.

**06:07**
When investors pay:
* You validate their thesis (not yours).
* You learn how to pitch (which might be a good thing).
* You might lose some control along the way.
* You have to start optimizing for exit (not customers).

**06:21**
The key takeaway here is that it is possible to bootstrap any idea until you validated real demand first.

**Lesson 6: Co-Founders are Like Marriage (Date Before You Commit)**

**06:28**
Lesson number six: Co-founders are like marriage. Date before you commit.

**06:33**
80% of billion-dollar companies have two or more co-founders. So you need a co-founder, right?

**06:38**
Yes, but if you choose wrong here, you only make already hard startups even harder.

**06:44**
The harsh reality here is that most co-founder breakups can kill a company.

**06:49**
The framework I like to use here is to experiment quickly with co-founders but hire slowly.

**06:54**
In other words, find ways to work together before you commit.

**06:58**
Do a weekend project first, or a side project for three months. See how you handle conflict and align on your vision, mission, and goals, and then commit.

**Lesson 7: Your Product's Bigger Context > Your Product's Features**

**07:08**
Lesson number seven: Your product's bigger context is much greater than your product's features.

**07:14**
Don't make a better camera; make a better photographer. This lesson changed my entire business.

**07:20**
Apple didn't disrupt cameras with a better camera; they disrupted cameras with smartphones that made you better at capturing moments.

**07:28**
The framework here is that features live in the solution context, but customer outcomes live in a much bigger context. And every product has this much bigger context.

**07:39**
So ask yourself:
1. What job is the customer trying to do?
2. What outcome do they really want?
3. How can I make them better (not just my product)?

**07:48**
When I shifted my internal mantra from building a better business modeling tool like Lean Canvas to making better entrepreneurs, everything changed in my business.

**Lesson 8: Overthinking Kills More Startups Than Bad Ideas**

**07:58**
Lesson number eight: Overthinking kills more startups than bad ideas.

**08:02**
A perfect plan is a plan for never start.

**08:05**
I see founders spending six months planning a perfect pitch deck, creating financial models, doing market research, writing business plans. Then they launch and learn that it was all wrong.

**08:15**
The framework I use is a 90-day startup blueprint.

**08:19**
90 days is all you need to:
1. Design a starting business model.
2. Validating demand before you build.
3. And if that checks out, then going all in from there.

**08:28**
You don't need a perfect plan to start; you can systematically test any idea in just 90 days.

**Lesson 9: The Happy Customer Loop is Your Only Growth Engine**

**08:34**
Lesson number nine: The happy customer loop is your only growth engine.

**08:39**
Forget everything about growth hacks. There's only one growth engine that matters.

**08:43**
The true job of an entrepreneur is to make a happy customer. Happy customers tell other people, which bring more happy customers to the mix. And that's it.

**08:52**
You can visualize this happy customer loop with this three-step framework:

**08:56**
Step number one: Activation. Get them to an "aha" moment quickly.

**09:02**
Step number two: Retention. Make them repeatedly happy through the happy customer loop.

**09:07**
Step number three: Then work on making referrals easy.

**09:12**
Most founders obsess over acquisition or conversion, and this is the wrong lever.

**09:16**
The happy customer moment is where you deliver value to your customers, and doing that repeatedly is the only causal step that matters.

**09:24**
It causes people to use your product more, buy more from you, and tell other people, which creates a natural growth loop.

**Lesson 10: 2026 Won't Be Any Different Unless You Are**

**09:32**
Lesson number 10: 2026 won't be any different unless you are.

**09:37**
"I'll start when the market is ready." "I'll launch after the holidays." "I'll validate when I have more time."

**09:43**
The harsh truth: Waiting for perfect timing is waiting forever.

**09:47**
2026 will look exactly like 2025 unless you're ready to think differently.

**09:53**
After working with thousands of founders, I've found that what separates success isn't differing skillsets, but differing mindsets.

**10:00**
Remember, with the right mindset, 90 days is all you need to test any type of an idea.

**10:06**
Like planting a tree, the best time to start was yesterday; the second-best time is now.

**10:11**
So if you have an idea gathering dust, stop waiting and just start.

**10:16**
On that note, if you're looking to get started with a new idea, I'll link a couple of resources in the description below.

**10:22**

Thanks for watching, and until next time, take care.


### **Startup Build Lessons Organized Notes**

**Business Model Strategy**
*   **00:26** Your business model is more critical than your initial product idea. A sound model can carry a mediocre idea, but a broken model will sink a brilliant one.
*   **01:03** Key Business Model Questions: Identify the problem, those affected, current alternative costs, your unique promise, your moat, and scalability.

**Execution & Launch Frameworks**
*   **01:45** Use the **Demo-Sell-Build** approach. Don't build the full product first; sell the demo to establish traction and minimize risk.
*   **08:15** Utilize a **90-Day Startup Blueprint**. Design a model and validate demand within 3 months before committing fully. Avoid spending months on pitch decks or financial models before real-world testing.

**Customer Validation & Acquisition**
*   **03:31** **Measure actions, not words.** Hypothetical "Would you use this?" questions are useless. Demand commitments like pre-orders to validate true interest.
*   **03:48** Handpick your first 10 early adopters. They should be distinct from your eventual mass-market users.
*   **04:26** Avoid freemium at launch. Focus on paying customers early to solve real problems and capture value.

**Financials & Funding**
*   **05:14** **Revenue is the best teacher.** Early revenue forces problem-solving, whereas VC funding can mask underlying issues.
*   **05:56** Prioritize customer funding over investor funding to maintain control and ensure you are building for customer value rather than an exit strategy.

**Team & Retention**
*   **06:28** Treat co-founder selection like marriage. Work on short projects or side projects for several months before formalizing the commitment.
*   **08:34** The **Happy Customer Loop** is the only sustainable growth engine. Focus on activation (quick "aha" moment), retention (repeated value), and referrals.

**Product Development Philosophy**
*   **07:08** Focus on the **bigger context of the customer outcome**. Instead of just improving product features, focus on making the customer more successful at their desired job/task.
*   **09:32** Success is driven by mindset rather than just technical skillsets. Avoid waiting for "perfect" timing; start testing ideas immediately.
