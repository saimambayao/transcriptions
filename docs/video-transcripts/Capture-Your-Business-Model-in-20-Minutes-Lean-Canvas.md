**Capture Your Business Model in 20 Minutes**

**Introduction: Create a Business Model Canvas in 20 Minutes**

**00:00**
Hi, this is Ash with Spark59. Today I'm going to show you how to create your initial business model canvas in 20 minutes.

**00:09**
You might be wondering why just 20 minutes? After all, a business model is a pretty complicated and critical thing to get right. Surely you should spend a lot more time on this.

**The Myth of the Perfect Plan**

**00:19**
But here's the thing: the perfect plan is a myth. 

**00:22**
Studies have shown that most successful companies report having drastically changed their original plans along the way. Companies like Groupon and PayPal, Flickr are all examples of this.

**00:33**
What really separates successful products from those that don't make it isn't necessarily starting with a perfect plan, but finding a plan that works before running out of resources.

**Empirical Testing vs Rhetorical Reasoning**

**00:44**
The way you do that isn't through rhetorical reasoning on a whiteboard in pursuit of that perfect plan, but rather through empirical testing.

**00:52**
Getting outside the building and stress testing and then refining your plan.

**Time Box Your Initial Canvas**

**00:57**
Time is our scarcest resource in a startup, which is why it is important to time box your initial canvas so you don't fall into the analysis paralysis trap.

**01:07**
I find that 20 minutes is enough time for the first pass. Perfection is not the goal here, but rather the goal is to sketch or baseline a snapshot of your current thinking.

**Getting Started on leancanvas.com**

**01:17**
With that out of the way, let's get started. 

**01:19**
If you haven't done this already, head on over to leancanvas.com and click the "Create Your Canvas" button to sign up for a free account.

**Naming Your Canvas**

**01:28**
After creating your account, you will be prompted to name your first canvas.

**01:32**
I like to name my canvases by the customer segment they address because I find that the customer segment box drives the rest of the canvas.

**01:40**
You probably already have an inkling of possible customers your product addresses in your head. 

**Segmenting Broad Markets**

**01:45**
But the first step is splitting broad customer segments into smaller ones. 

**01:50**
Each of these vertical segments potentially represents a different business model and should ideally have its own canvas.

**01:57**
This is sometimes hard to see, so it might help to consider an example.

**Case Study: CloudFire Photo Sharing**

**02:02**
This is an actual product I built in my last company. CloudFire was a service that helped people share lots of photos and videos easily with each other. 

**02:11**
The really broad category here was anyone that shares lots of photos and videos. While I would have loved to service that market, it's not specific enough.

**02:20**
When you try to market to everyone, especially as a startup, you end up marketing to no one.

**Identifying Specific Customer Segments**

**02:26**
Down below you'll see a number of more specific and possible customer segments that I then created.

**02:32**
Sometimes the split won't be perfect. For instance, photographers, videographers, and graphic designers may share enough common attributes to be lumped together as a creative segment.

**02:43**
I wouldn't worry too much about that right now. The most important thing though is not going too broad, like using "anyone that shares lots of photos and videos," or going too narrow where you shrink the market size too much.

**Pick Your Strongest Segment**

**02:57**
The next step is to pick your strongest customer segment for your canvas. 

**03:01**
This might be one you most want to service, know the most about, or have the strongest channel to reach. 

**03:08**
Whatever your reasons, start with a single customer segment and use that as the name of your canvas.

**CloudFire Example: Choosing Parents**

**03:14**
For the CloudFire product, I decided to use parents as my first customer segment, mostly because I had recently become a parent around that time frame and observed several problems that I was motivated to explore.

**Traversing the Canvas Screen**

**03:26**
After doing this, you should then see the canvas screen. You can simply click in any of the boxes to start typing. 

**03:33**
The blue numbers indicate a suggested order for traversing the canvas. This order is only a recommendation. Even I'm going to deviate from it slightly in this video, based on a newer flow I have been more recently using.

**Walkthrough Instructions**

**03:46**
For the rest of the video, I'm going to walk the canvas and show you how to fill each section using the CloudFire product as a concrete example you can reference.

**03:55**
It is most effective to complete your canvas as I cover each section while the content is still fresh in your mind. So I'll have you pause the video after each section before moving on.

**The Problem-Customer Segment Quadrant**

**04:06**
So my preferred flow these days is to complete the canvas in a set of blocks. 

**04:11**
The first block that I like to tackle is the problem-customer segment quadrant. 

**04:16**
So much of your business model is dependent on the proper identification of customers and their problems that a solid footing here creates a very strong foundation for the rest of your canvas.

**Filling the Customer Segment Box**

**04:28**
You've already identified your main customer segment from earlier which goes in the customer segment box. 

**04:34**
It's common to have multiple participants or user roles in your business model. I would next go ahead and list all of them out here. 

**04:42**
But you should distinguish between customers and users when you do so. 

**Defining Customers vs Users**

**04:47**
That distinction is pretty simple: customers pay you, and your users do not. 

**04:52**
For most products, that distinction is also pretty straightforward. In a software as a service product for instance, you attract leads or users and aim to convert some or all of them into paying customers.

**Multi-sided Businesses and Advertising Models**

**05:04**
In a multi-sided business like the one driven by advertising, for example Google search, you have users who create value through participation that you then monetize through ads. 

**05:15**
Here the advertisers are your customers and the users are those that are doing searches.

**Single Canvas Strategy**

**05:20**
For these types of products, I recommend keeping both users and customers on a single canvas.

**Marketplace Business Complexity**

**05:26**
Marketplace businesses, however, are a lot more complicated. Here you often have two or more parties that simultaneously work to create value. 

**05:35**
Classic examples are eBay, Airbnb, where you need both buyers and sellers to make the business work.

**Incentives for Multiple Parties**

**05:42**
Additionally, each party often has a different incentive, channel, and other elements on the canvas that you also need to understand. 

**05:50**
So for these types of businesses, I recommend creating a separate canvas for each party involved.

**Hashtag Feature and Grouping**

**05:57**
As a side aside, there is a hashtag feature in the Lean Canvas tool that lets you visually group different customer segments on the same canvas.

**06:05**
In the screenshot above, you'll notice different colors for buyers and sellers on the canvas based on the hashtags that are reused in multiple sections.

**06:14**
This is a nice feature that lets you quickly keep all your customer segments on a single canvas and toggle them on and off. 

**06:20**
But if you're more comfortable creating separate canvases, do that instead.

**Identifying Early Adopters**

**06:25**
Now it's time to get even more specific with your customer segments and further narrow them down into early adopters. 

**06:32**
Early adopters are those people that need your product the most and the early success of your business model is going to be highly dependent on how well you can define and qualify your early adopters.

**Narrowing Your Focus: The Facebook Example**

**06:44**
While we all would like to build a product like Facebook that is used by practically everyone on the planet, even Facebook started with a very specific early adopter.

**06:53**
Which happened to be a college student, and not just any college student, but a college student on the Harvard campus.

**CloudFire Example: Customer Segment List**

**07:00**
Here is a customer segment box for the CloudFire product. I've listed parents as the primary customer and their family and friends as viewers. 

**07:09**
Down below I've further qualified my early adopters to be parents with younger kids because I felt that they would need my product more than parents with older kids.

**Pause: Complete Customer Segment Box**

**07:18**
Pause the video here and complete your customer segment box before moving on.

**The Problem Box: Top Three Problems**

**07:25**
With your customer segments and early adopters defined, we'll now move on to the problem box. 

**07:31**
Outline the top three problems your product addresses for this early adopter. You can have less than three problems but try not to list more than three.

**Root Cause Analysis: The Five Whys**

**07:38**
A helpful technique for uncovering good problems at this stage is using a "five whys." 

**07:43**
You start with a customer problem, which is usually a surface problem or symptom. You then ask yourself why this is a problem and do this five times. 

**07:52**
Each time refining the list of problems till you have a list of deeper problems that you can put on your canvas.

**CloudFire Example: The Hardship of Photo Sharing**

**07:58**
Here's an example of this technique applied to the CloudFire product. 

**Jobs to be Done Concept**

**08:04**
Another useful technique is using the "job to be done" concept popularized by Clayton Christensen. 

**08:10**
The basic idea here is that customers hire your product to get a job done. This is often something they have already been trying to do but probably unsuccessfully.

**08:20**
Once you correctly identify that job, you're in a much better position to identify underlying problems and eventually define a solution for that.

**Existing Alternatives Quadrant**

**08:30**
This idea also ties nicely into the next quadrant where you ask yourself how your early adopters solve these problems today.

**08:37**
Here you want to be able to describe your customer's current reality. What existing solutions or alternatives are they using today to get the job done? 

**08:46**
Doing nothing, by the way, is also an alternative. 

**08:50**
As we'll see shortly, this information will be invaluable in properly positioning and pricing your product.

**CloudFire Example: Problem List and Alternatives**

**08:57**
Here is my filled-out problem box for the CloudFire product. You'll see a list of three top problems I picked from the earlier "five whys" analysis.

**09:05**
Along with a list of possible existing alternatives parents use for photo and video sharing.

**Pause: Complete Problem Box**

**09:12**
Pause the video here and complete your problem box before moving on.

**The Solution, UVP, and Revenue Blocks**

**09:18**
The next set of blocks I like to tackle is the combination of your solution, your unique value proposition, and revenue streams. 

**09:26**
These three things taken together help to define your offer or minimum viable product, which I'll define here in a second.

**Avoiding the Solution Hazard**

**09:33**
The solution box is the one we entrepreneurs are most in love with because we love to build cool stuff. But your solution isn't usually what's riskiest on the canvas.

**09:43**
Instead of falling in love with your solution, embrace the concept of a minimum viable product.

**Minimum Viable Product Definition**

**09:49**
An MVP is the smallest solution that delivers customer value. That is, it still solves a specific problem and ideally also captures some of that value.

**10:00**
Which is just a fancy way of saying it gets you paid.

**Deep Understanding Before Solution Definition**

**10:04**
Until you gain a deep understanding of your customers and their problems, you cannot really define the right solution.

**10:11**
That said, I'm sure you have an inkling of what you'd like to build anyway, so let's list those but still constrain them around the top three problems you listed earlier.

**Outline Your Solution Vision**

**10:20**
So for each problems that you listed earlier, briefly outline how you envision solving them using your solution.

**CloudFire Example: Software and Features**

**10:29**
Here is my filled-out solution box for the CloudFire product. I envision solving these problems with software and list the top three features I would need to include in my minimum viable product.

**Pause: Complete Solution Box**

**10:41**
Again, pause the video here and complete your solution box before moving on.

**The Unique Value Proposition Box**

**10:48**
Next we turn to the unique value proposition. Not only is this one of the hardest things to get right, but it's also the most critical, at least initially.

**Winning the Battle for Attention**

**10:57**
For new products, the initial battle is getting noticed at all. It's getting a chance to have a meaningful dialogue with a prospect.

**11:06**
You get this chance by making a compelling offer or promise represented by your unique value proposition.

**11:12**
The good news is that like everything else on your canvas, your unique value proposition is also a guess or hypothesis. You'll have lots of opportunity to test and refine it later.

**Deriving the UVP**

**11:22**
Here are some techniques for getting started. 

**11:24**
Your unique value proposition is derived from the intersection of your problem and your solution. So craft your unique value proposition around your number one problem and finished story benefit.

**The Finished Story Benefit**

**11:41**
Your finished story benefit is the value a customer derives after using your product. 

**11:46**
So if you have a job board service for instance, your unique value proposition isn't the cool resume building feature you have, but rather the promise of helping job seekers find their dream job.

**Avoiding Generic Marketing Buzzwords**

**11:57**
Next, avoid the use of empty words like simple, fast, or easy. Yes, I know Apple uses these all the time, but you are not Apple.

**12:05**
They can get away with it because they have built a reputation and brand around simplicity. You haven't and need to be a lot more specific with your unique value proposition.

**The Instant Clarity Headline Formula**

**12:14**
Here is a formula by way of Dane Maxwell for creating a compelling unique value proposition that uses three fragments.

**12:21**
The first is the end result the customer wants, which is like the finished story benefit. 

**12:26**
The next is constraining that with a specific period of time when they would see these results. 

**12:31**
And then finally you want to address any objections they might have.

**12:35**
The second and third items in the formula are great if you can fit them into your unique value proposition without sounding overly salesy. Otherwise, leave them out.

**Examples of UVP Story Elements**

**12:44**
Down below are several examples of unique value propositions that use a finished story benefit with some or all of these elements.

**The High-Concept PitchSound Bite**

**12:53**
And finally it's a good exercise to work on your high-concept pitch. 

**12:56**
The high-concept pitch is something Hollywood producers use all the time to distill the script of a new movie they are pitching into a memorable sound bite.

**High-Concept Pitches for Products**

**13:04**
So for instance, instead of describing the movie *Aliens*, they might just say it's like the movie *Jaws*, only in space.

**13:11**
You can do the same thing with products. 

**13:13**
For example when YouTube first launched, the founders were describing it as "Flickr for videos."

**Distinguishing UVP and High-Concept Pitch**

**13:18**
It's important to recognize that the high-concept pitch is not a unique value proposition. It's not something you'd put on your landing page, but it is valuable nonetheless.

**13:27**
It's valuable for helping spreading the meme of your product by word of mouth.

**CloudFire Example: UVP and High-Level Concept**

**13:32**
Here is my filled-out unique value proposition for the CloudFire product. You'll see a couple of unique value propositions here along with a simple high-level concept.

**Pause: Complete Unique Value Proposition Box**

**13:42**
Pause the video here and complete your unique value proposition box before continuing on.

**The Revenue Streams and Pricing Box**

**13:49**
Next we're going to cover your revenue streams or pricing box. 

**13:52**
At first glance this might seem a little out of place since we have mostly been considering aspects around your solution.

**Pricing is Part of Your Product**

**13:58**
But pricing is very much part of your solution. It's very much part of your product. I often use an example to illustrate this.

**14:06**
Imagine you have two bottles of water in front of you. One is priced at a dollar and the other at three dollars. Which one do you think is better?

**Pricing Logic vs Taste Tests**

**14:14**
Even though both bottles would probably be indistinguishable in a blind taste test, here price alone has the power to define the product in your mind.

**14:23**
The next question: which bottled water would you pick?

**Pricing Determines the Target Customer**

**14:27**
Not only is price a part of your product but it also determines the customers you attract. 

**14:33**
In the case of bottled water, we know markets exist at both price points, but the customers who routinely buy three dollar bottled water are different from those that would prefer the one dollar bottle.

**Daunting Task: Value-Based Pricing**

**14:44**
Pricing is often considered more art than science and can seem pretty daunting, but there are some simple techniques for getting you started.

**14:52**
I often see entrepreneurs doing cost-based pricing versus value-based pricing, which is a mistake. 

**15:00**
Remember customers hire your product to get a job done. When they view your product, they naturally compare it against their existing alternatives, not what it costs you to deliver your solution.

**Alternatives as Price Anchors**

**15:08**
These alternatives serves as price anchors in your customer's minds. That is why it is so important to understand these existing alternatives and then position your solution against them.

**Keeping Pricing Simple at the Start**

**15:19**
I'm also a big proponent of keeping your pricing as simple as possible, at least at the beginning.

**15:24**
Resist the urge to create multiple pricing plans at this point. Rather pick a price aimed at your early adopters and keep their existing alternatives in mind.

**Tipping Points in Multi-sided Business Models**

**15:34**
In the case of a multi-sided business model, even though you aren't directly charging your users, you are still building an asset. 

**15:42**
The challenge with these business models is that this asset isn't worth anything until you pass a certain threshold or tipping point.

**Advertising Rates and Acquisitions Estimations**

**15:48**
Find out what that tipping point is and get some ballpark numbers on the value of that asset by looking at comparable advertising rates and/or acquisitions depending on the type of business you are building.

**CloudFire Example: Revenue Streams and Anchors**

**16:01**
Here is my filled-out revenue streams box for the CloudFire product. I used my existing alternatives as anchors which range from zero dollars with Facebook all the way to 99 dollars for the Apple MobileMe service. 

**16:13**
I used these alternatives to come up with my starting price of 49 dollars a year.

**Pause: Complete Revenue Streams Box**

**16:18**
Pause the video here and complete your revenue stream box before moving on.

**The Channels: Your Path to Customers**

**16:25**
Next we're going to cover channels or your path to customers. 

**16:29**
Your channels or path to customers are one of the more riskier items on your canvas. 

**16:34**
You might be able to identify a problem worth solving, build out a solution and even get a small group of customers to derive value from it. 

**16:41**
But if you can't get your product in front of enough customers, none of that might matter.

**Building Channels from Day One**

**16:46**
Channels aren't something to defer to later but rather something you should start building and testing from day one.

**Manual Channels and Initial Learning**

**16:53**
The good news is that you don't need to build scalable channels from day one. It's okay to start with a handful of outbound channels to jumpstart your learning first.

**Outbound Channel Prospecting**

**17:02**
Here are some possible outbound channel suggestions that might help.

**Planning Future Scalability**

**17:07**
At the same time, take a step at identifying where your scalable channels might come from. 

**17:12**
These typically take time to build so it helps to think about them now versus later.

**Scalable Inbound Channels List**

**17:18**
Here's a list of some possible scalable channels that you might be able to employ later on.

**CloudFire Example: Outbound and Inbound Channels**

**17:25**
Now here is my filled-out channels box for the CloudFire product. You'll find a combination of outbound and inbound channels listed here.

**Pause: Complete Channels Box**

**17:34**
Pause the video here and complete your channels box before moving on.

**Measuring Success: Key Metrics**

**17:40**
Now we're going to move on to how you measure success using key metrics. 

**17:44**
Key metrics represent the key numbers that tell you how your business is doing. 

**17:48**
A startup is inherently chaotic but at any given point in time there only a few key actions or metrics that matter.

**Identify Two Initial Key Metrics**

**17:55**
These will change as your product moves through various stages but at this point in time I'd like you to identify two key metrics.

**Identifying the Value Action**

**18:03**
The first is identifying the key customer action that drives value in your product. 

**18:07**
In other words, ask yourself what key activity would you use to measure your value proposition? 

**18:13**
So for example, if you were building a blogging platform, publishing a blog post would be the key activity. For Twitter, posting a tweet is a key activity.

**Worthwhile Product Targets**

**18:22**
The second key metric is stating your success metric for your product. 

**18:26**
What would you need to achieve to make this product worthwhile? It could be a revenue target like building a 10 million dollar business or a 100 million dollar business. 

**18:36**
It could be having some impact on the world or it could be something else altogether.

**CloudFire Example: Sharing and Customer Volume**

**18:41**
Here is my filled-out key metrics box for the CloudFire product. My key activity is based around sharing. 

**18:47**
If a parent doesn't routinely share their photos and videos with others, chances are they will lose interest and not keep paying for the product.

**18:54**
My success metric for CloudFire was building a 5 million dollar business which roughly translated to 100,000 customers.

**Pause: Complete Key Metrics Box**

**19:03**
Pause the video here and complete your key metrics box before moving on.

**The Home Stretch: Runway and Affordability**

**19:09**
We're at the home stretch now. 

**19:12**
After getting hit with a killer idea and convincing yourself it's worth pursuing, the next thing that should be keeping you up at night is how you build enough runway for your product.

**Ballpark Sizing and Resource Feasibility**

**19:22**
We'll use this section to do some ballpark sizing of your business model and estimate scope and feasibility of implementing it.

**Fixed and Variable Costs Outline**

**19:29**
Start by outlining your fixed and variable costs. Things like people, servers, and other resources you will need to implement this business model. 

**19:38**
It's impossible to be totally accurate at this stage because a lot of it will change with time.

**Horizon Analysis: The Break-Even Point**

**19:43**
It does help to consider a shorter horizon like a break-even point and use your pricing and cost structure to come up with the number of customers you would need to break even.

**Identifying Worthwhile Problems**

**19:53**
And then go all the way. Calculate how many customers you would need to realize your metric for success from earlier. 

**20:00**
Again, the point is not accuracy but ballpark sizing for establishing if you have a problem worth solving on your hands.

**CloudFire Example: Cost Structure Estimate**

**20:07**
Here is my filled-out cost structure box for the CloudFire product.

**The Final Box: Unfair Advantage**

**20:18**
And now the final box: the unfair advantage. 

**20:22**
Unfair advantage is also sometimes called competitive advantage or barriers to entry on a business plan. 

**20:28**
It essentially describes how you'll defend against competitive attacks. 

**20:32**
Most first-time entrepreneurs don't completely understand what constitutes an unfair advantage and often list things that aren't.

**The First-to-Market Disadvantage**

**20:40**
One of the most commonly cited unfair advantage is being first to market. 

**20:43**
Take a look at these companies. None of them were first movers in their markets but fast followers. 

**20:49**
One could actually argue that being first to market can be a disadvantage because the burden of learning and marketing a new product is all on the first mover.

**Sustainable Competitive Advantages**

**20:57**
Here are other things commonly cited on business plans. All of these things while important don't create a sustainable unfair advantage on their own.

**A Real Unfair Advantage Defined**

**21:05**
So what is a real unfair advantage? I subscribe to a simple definition put forward by Jason Cohen who is currently the founder of WP Engine and also writes the popular *A Smart Bear* blog.

**21:16**
His definition is that a real unfair advantage is something that cannot be easily copied or bought.

**Real Unfair Advantage Examples**

**21:22**
So let's list out some examples of some real unfair advantages.
1. Insider information
2. Personal authority
3. A dream team
4. Existing customers
5. The "right" celebrity endorsements
6. Large network effects
7. Community
8. Organic search (SEO) ranking
9. Patents (maybe)
10. Core values

**The Facebook Growth Story**

**21:29**
The bad news is that you probably didn't see an unfair advantage that applies to you today. The good news is that that's okay. 

**21:35**
Even Facebook didn't really have an unfair advantage when they started. They were number 11 or 12 at building a social network but they still managed to build the largest social network on the planet, which has now become their unfair advantage.

**The Unfair Advantage Narrative**

**21:47**
The more important thing is to have an unfair advantage story. 

**21:51**
Unlike the other boxes on the canvas, the unfair advantage is unfortunately not one you decide to test one day. 

**21:58**
If and when you start getting some traction with your product, your unfair advantage will be tested by competition and copycats.

**Blank Boxes as Reminders**

**22:06**
You may also not have a readily identifiable unfair advantage today. Rather than listing something weak and clearly not an unfair advantage, leave this section blank.

**22:15**
Some unfair advantages are revealed over time, like in the case of Zappos. 

**22:19**
Having a blank box staring back at you also serves as a constant reminder to keep looking for one.

**CloudFire Example: Community Differentiation**

**22:26**
Here is my filled-out unfair advantage box for the CloudFire product. 

**22:30**
Since it's targeted at a very specific and emotional niche, I envision building differentiation over time by fostering a strong sense of community among my customers.

**Congratulations: Capturing Plan A**

**22:44**
So there you have it. If you followed along you should have captured your first business model. Congratulations. 

**Stress Testing Your Business Model**

**22:50**
Next time I'll cover how to bulletproof this business model from here and show you how to start the process of stress testing your Plan A. 

**Closing Remarks**

**23:00**
Until then, take care.

### **Organized Notes: Capturing a Business Model in 20 Minutes**

**I. Strategic Philosophy**
*   **Timestamp: 00:19 - 00:33**
*   **The Myth of the Perfect Plan:** Successful companies rarely stick to their original Plan A. 66% report drastic changes.
*   **Goal:** Focus on finding a path to a plan that works before running out of resources, rather than writing a "better" initial plan.
*   **Time Boxing:** Limit initial canvas creation to 20 minutes to avoid the analysis paralysis trap and focus on empirical testing.

**II. The Lean Canvas Tool**
*   **Timestamp: 01:19 - 01:40**
*   **Website:** Initial canvases can be built at [leancanvas.com](http://leancanvas.com).
*   **Naming Convention:** Canvases should be named after the customer segment they address, as this box drives the entire model.

**III. Customer Segmentation & Narrowing**
*   **Timestamp: 01:45 - 03:14**
*   **Broad vs. Specific:** Broad segments like "anyone who shares photos" are ineffective. Startups must market to specific verticals.
*   **Rule of Reach:** Marketing to everyone results in marketing to no one.
*   **Case Study (CloudFire):** Transitioned from a broad photo-sharing category to a specific segment: "Parents with young kids."

**IV. Users vs. Customers**
*   **Timestamp: 04:42 - 05:50**
*   **Customer:** The person who pays for the product.
*   **User:** The person who uses the product without direct payment (e.g., in advertising-driven models).
*   **Separate Canvases:** Required for complex "multi-sided" or marketplace models (like eBay or Airbnb) where buyers and sellers have distinct incentives and channels.

**V. Early Adopters**
*   **Timestamp: 06:25 - 07:00**
*   **Definition:** People who need the product most urgently. Early success depends on identifying and qualifying this group.
*   **Example:** Facebook initially ignored the general public and focused exclusively on Harvard students.

**VI. Identifying Problems**
*   **Timestamp: 07:38 - 08:30**
*   **Top Three:** List no more than the three most critical problems addressed by the product.
*   **The Five Whys:** A technique to dig past surface symptoms to find root causes.
*   **Jobs to be Done (JTBD):** Customers "hire" products to accomplish specific tasks.

**VII. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**
*   **Timestamp: 09:33 - 10:11**
*   **The Hazard:** Founders often fall in love with features rather than solving the risky problems on the canvas.
*   **MVP Definition:** The smallest solution that solves a problem, delivers value, and gets the founder paid.

**VIII. Unique Value Proposition (UVP)**
*   **Timestamp: 10:48 - 12:52**
*   **Winning Attention:** The UVP is a promise meant to secure dialogue with a prospect.
*   **Finished Story Benefit:** Focus on the outcome for the customer (e.g., "Find your dream job" vs. "Resume builder").
*   **Dane Maxwell Formula:** [End result customer wants] + [Specific time period] + [Address objections].

**IX. High-Concept Pitch vs. UVP**
*   **Timestamp: 12:53 - 13:27**
*   **Distinction:** The High-Concept Pitch is a sound bite (e.g., "Flickr for videos") used for word-of-mouth meme spreading, not for landing pages.

**X. Pricing Strategy**
*   **Timestamp: 13:58 - 15:18**
*   **Price as Quality Indicator:** Price alone has the power to define product perception in a customer's mind.
*   **Value-Based vs. Cost-Based:** entrepreneurs should focus on value relative to existing alternatives rather than internal costs.
*   **Price Anchoring:** Customers compare new products to the alternatives they currently use.

**XI. Distribution Channels**
*   **Timestamp: 16:29 - 17:18**
*   **Building early:** Channels must be built and tested from day one.
*   **Outbound vs. Inbound:** Start with outbound (direct outreach) for initial learning; plan inbound (content, ads) for later scalability.

**XII. Key Metrics & Cost Structure**
*   **Timestamp: 17:40 - 20:00**
*   **Value Proposition Metric:** Identify the one specific customer action that proves they derived value (e.g., posting a tweet).
*   **Ballpark sizing:** Cost structure and revenue streams should be used to estimate break-even points and the volume needed for long-term success.

**XIII. Unfair Advantage**
*   **Timestamp: 20:22 - 21:16**
*   **Common Myths:** First-to-market is not a sustainable advantage; most giants (Toyota, Apple, Google) were fast followers.
*   **Jason Cohen Definition:** Something that cannot be easily copied or bought (e.g., insider information, dream team, large network effects).
*   **Zappos Model:** Some advantages reveal themselves over time. If unidentified, leave the box blank as a reminder to keep looking.
