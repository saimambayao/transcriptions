**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) was established as the interim government of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) to oversee the transition period until the election of the first regular Bangsamoro Parliament;

**WHEREAS**, pursuant to Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), the BTA is mandated to ensure the smooth transition of governmental powers, functions, assets, and liabilities to the duly elected regular Bangsamoro Parliament;

**WHEREAS**, the BTA currently manages a budget allocation of approximately P75-90 billion annually, encompassing various development projects, infrastructure programs, and governance initiatives that will require systematic documentation and proper turnover;

**WHEREAS**, the upcoming first parliamentary elections scheduled for October 2025, as provided by Republic Act No. 12123, will mark the formal turnover of governance from the BTA to the duly elected regular Bangsamoro Parliament, necessitating the proper documentation, inventory, and transition planning to ensure continuity and efficiency in governance;

**WHEREAS**, several BTA offices and ministries have yet to complete their staffing, systems, processes, and implementation of programs and projects, thereby necessitating comprehensive and integrated documentation;

**WHEREAS**, it is imperative for the Office of the Chief Minister (OCM) and the Office of the Parliament Speaker (OPS) to jointly coordinate in establishing a Technical Working Group (TWG) to oversee the preparation of necessary documents, reports, and transition plans for the turnover of the BTA to the incoming regular Bangsamoro Parliament;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved, to urge the Office of the Chief Minister (OCM) and the Office of the Parliament Speaker (OPS) to jointly create a Technical Working Group (TWG) which shall be tasked with preparing the necessary documents, reports, inventories, and plans to ensure the effective and orderly turnover of the BTA to the incoming regular Bangsamoro Parliament;
