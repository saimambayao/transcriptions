**DIRECTING THE MINISTRY OF PUBLIC WORKS (MPW) AND THE BANGSAMORO PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY (BPDA) TO FACILITATE THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF THE PROVINCIAL AND MUNICIPAL PRIORITY DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, FOR NATIONAL GOVERNMENT FUNDING**

**WHEREAS**, under Section 8, Article XVI of the Organic Law, 15 primary ministries are created to serve as the institutional mechanisms for the implementation of good governance policies in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. One of the primary ministries is the Ministry of Public Works that takes the lead in the planning and implementation of infrastructure plans and programs;

**WHEREAS**, Section 6, Article VI of the same law created an Intergovernmental Infrastructure Development Board which shall be responsible for coordinating and synchronizing national and Bangsamoro infrastructure development plans whose members shall be representatives from both the Bangsamoro Government and the National Government, respectively;

**WHEREAS**, Section 37, Article XIII of the same law provides that the National Government shall fund and implement the construction and maintenance of national roads, bridges, water supply and services and flood control and irrigation systems and for the maintenance of existing airports, seaports and wharves in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS**, Section 23, Article XII of the same law provides that immediately after the ratification of this Organic Law, and for another five (5) years thereafter, the National Government shall provide for additional funds that will subsidize expenditures for development projects and infrastructure in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, including provincial and municipal roads in accordance with a development plan formulated by the Bangsamoro Government. Despite this provision nearing its conclusion, there are no notable nor significant programs and projects that have been implemented;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority (BPDA) is created under Section 14 of Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 06 as the socio-economic development planning and policy coordinating authority of the Bangsamoro Government;

**WHEREAS**, the BPDA is mandated as responsible for development planning, investment programming, monitoring and evaluation and coordination of all development initiatives in the region¹;

**WHEREAS**, the MPW and the BPDA shall facilitate the preparation and submission of the proposed provincial and municipal development projects and infrastructure of the local government units, significantly provincial and municipal roads, for funding by the national government agencies, as required by the Organic Law. The National Government and the Bangsamoro Government, through the Intergovernmental Relations Body, shall agree on the amount and manner of release of said amount to the Bangsamoro Government;

**WHEREAS**, it is important to underscore that the funding assistance being extended by the National Government to the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region for nationally funded infrastructure projects including provincial and municipal road projects of the local government units, are outside of the block grant provided by the National Government to the Bangsamoro Government.

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED** by the BTA Parliament to pass and approve this Resolution directing the Ministry of Public Works and the Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority to facilitate the preparation and submission of the provincial and municipal priority development projects, for National Government funding.
