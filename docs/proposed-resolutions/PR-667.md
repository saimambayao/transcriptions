**WHEREAS**, the inhabitants of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region have been plagued by a rise in the prices of basic commodities in the Region.

**WHEREAS**, the Philippine Statistics Authority – Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (PSA-BARMM) released the 2024 Annual Average Inflation Rates on January 7, 2025. The report highlighted a decline in the overall average inflation rate from 6.3% in 2023 to 3.9% in 2024. However, several essential commodity groups experienced inflationary pressures. The average inflation rate for health in the region increased to 2.1% in 2024 from only 0.8% in 2023. The inflation rate for transport services increased to 3.1% in 2024 from 0.6% in 2023. The inflation rate of Housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels increased to 3.4% in 2024 from 3.0% in 2023. Finally, the inflation rate for education services increased to 6.8% in 2024 from 5.0% in 2023.

**WHEREAS**, the persistent rise in the cost of living due to inflation has significantly affected the purchasing power of employees, particularly those in the lower income brackets, making it imperative for the government to extend financial relief;

**WHEREAS**, the price surge will be aggravated further by the rise in the cost of basic commodities during the month of Ramadhan.

**WHEREAS**, the Holy Month of Ramadhan is a sacred and significant period for the Bangsamoro people, marked by spiritual reflection, fasting, and communal generosity, and providing financial assistance during this time would greatly aid employees in meeting their essential needs;

**WHEREAS**, providing additional allowance during the month of Ramadhan to all personnel and employees of the BARMM is one way of motivating them to work harder and be more productive even in the difficult time of the month-long fasting and dusk-to-dawn prayers;

**WHEREAS**, the grant of this assistance to the regional government employees will also redound to the benefit of business entrepreneurs as it will contend the reduction in the purchasing capabilities of most of the consumers;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Government had previously granted similar relief allowance in the past years.

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Parliament of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to **REQUEST THE OFFICE OF THE HONORABLE CHIEF MINISTER TO GRANT INFLATION RELIEF ASSISTANCE OF NOT LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND PESOS (₱10,000.00) TO ALL OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS GOVERNMENT, REGARDLESS OF STATUS, INCLUDING PERSONS ENGAGED UNDER CONTRACTS OF SERVICE AND JOB ORDERS, EXCLUDING MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT, MINISTERS, DEPUTY MINISTERS, DIRECTOR GENERALS, AND HEADS OF OFFICES, TO BE RELEASED DURING THE MONTH OF RAMADHAN 1446, SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS.**
