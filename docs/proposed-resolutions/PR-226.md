**A RESOLUTION REQUESTING THE HONORABLE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT AND MINISTER OF THE MINISTRY OF BASIC, HIGHER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION (MBHTE) MOHAGHER M. IQBAL TO ESTABLISH A MECHANISM THAT GUARANTEES STREAMLINED TRANSITIONAL MANAGEMENT OF THE COTABATO FOUNDATION COLLEGE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (CFCST) - PIKIT EXTENSION UNIT, NOW UNDER THE TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION OF THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS GOVERNMENT; AND PROPOSING CONDITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN MBHTE AND CFCST SUCH AS, BUT NOT LIMITED TO CONTINUED PROVISION OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO AND MANAGEMENT OF THE SCHOOL BY CFCST, WITH MBHTE COUNTERPARTING DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD WHICH MAY DEPEND ON THE AVAILABILITY OF SEPARATE FUNDS FOR THE SCHOOL AT THE TIME OF ITS TURNOVER TO MBHTE AS MAY BE FURTHER EXPLORED AND AGREED UPON BY THE TWO PARTIES, WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO RELATED IDEAS OR PLANS OF THE MINISTRY**

**WHEREAS**, the Cotabato Foundation College of Science and Technology (CFCST) - Pikit Extension Unit, also called CFCST-Pikit Extension College or Pikit Extension College, or simple Extension College is situated in Barangay Batulawan, Pikit, Cotabato with a consistent student population of almost 100% Bangsamoro who are children of Moro mujahideen and mujahidat;

**WHEREAS**, Barangay Batulawan is among the sixty-three (63) barangays of Cotabato province which opted to join the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in the February 6, 2019 plebiscite, and consequently became integral component of the Special Geographic Area (SGA) of the Bangsamoro autonomous region;

**WHEREAS**, the CFCST-Pikit Extension College is offering undergraduate programs in agriculture, education, social works, criminology, community development, food technology, forestry and other related disciplines; and graduate programs, both master’s and doctorate, in education and rural development;

**WHEREAS**, all of the specifically mentioned academic programs of the Pikit Extension College are certified by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and are all accredited by the Accrediting Agency of Chartered Colleges and Universities in the Philippines (AACCUP), ranging from Level I to Level IV;

**WHEREAS**, the ISO-Certified and AACCUP-Accredited academic programs of the Extension College are the results primarily of the school’s effective management, availability of competent learning facilitators and motivated students, accessibility of the learning facilitators and students to teaching and learning equipment and facilities although these equipment and facilities are still limited; and the inspiring performance of its graduates in board examinations, especially in education where the school has mustered above the national average passing rate in the last Licensure Examination for Teachers (LET);

**WHEREAS**, the striking performance of the college is a primal asset for its recognition as future forefront Bangsamoro community college, and eventually Bangsamoro university in the Special Geographic Area (SGA), In Sha Allah, once it is turned over to the MBHTE by CFCST at the proper time;

**WHEREAS**, outright turnover of the school to the MBHTE may be untimely in consideration of some factors, the most probable are the recruitment and hiring of competent new personnel, provision of competitive salaries of these personnel and sustainable operation of the school if separate funds are not yet available during the turnover. It is possible that most, if not all, of the teaching and non-teaching plantilla personnel of the school under the CFCST management will return back to their mother unit if the Bangsamoro government is not yet ready to establish the aforesaid conditions;

**WHEREAS**, the experience of the Kidapawan City College (KCC) and USM-Buluan Extension College is a good example to ponder, where both schools wanted to separate from their mother unit, the University of Southern Mindanao (USM), Kabacan, Cotabato, and operate as autonomous college; and

**WHEREAS**, USM granted the demands of KCC and USM-Buluan but the personnel of these schools, particularly the teachers preferred to stay with the University for reason that USM is a Commission on Higher Education (CHED)-recognized Level IV university while the separating extension colleges may be granted a provisional Level I status which may affect their employment condition, the regular release of their salaries and access to more opportunities, to mention a few.

**NOW THEREFORE**, for and in consideration of the foregoing premises, be it

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to request the honorable Member of Parliament and Minister of the Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education (MBHTE) Mohagher M. Iqbal to establish a mechanism that ensures streamlined transitional management of the Cotabato Foundation College of Science and Technology - Pikit Extension Unit, now under the territorial jurisdiction of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Government; and proposing conditional arrangements between MBHTE and CFCST such as, but not limited to continuous provision of financial support to and management of the school by CFCST, with MBHTE contributing during the transition period which may depend on the availability of separate funds for the school at the time of its turnover to MBHTE as may be further explored and agreed upon by the two parties, without prejudice to related ideas or plans of the Ministry;

**RESOLVED SPECIFICALLY**, to offer conditional arrangements for consideration by MBHTE and CFCST, or as among other references of the two parties in the formulation of a feasible mechanism that ensures uninterrupted operation of the Pikit Extension College during the transition period, to wit:

**(1)** That the turnover of the Pikit Extension College to the MBHTE by CFCST shall be done after a separate national appropriation and/or sustainable alternative source(s) of funds for the personnel and operation of the school shall have been in place;

**(2)** That CFCST shall continue to administer and manage the school until the MBHTE takeover shall have been in place based on the agreed transition period between the two parties;

**(3)** That CFCST shall keep its financial obligation going for the salary of the school’s personnel, maintenance of existing material assets, and other related matters during the transition period which may be further explored and agreed by the MBHTE and CFCST in reference to the first arrangement;

**(4)** That MBHTE shall stipulate its technical and financial counterparts especially in the current academic, infrastructure and other development programs and activities of the college during the transition period; and

**(5)** That, the Pikit Extension College may bear a new name “Bangsamoro College of Science and Technology (BCST) after its turnover to the MBHTE by CFCST, subject to the observance of legal protocols.

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, that a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or any appropriate document relative to the MBHTE-CFCST transition arrangements in the management of the extension school shall be drafted and signed by the heads of the two parties.

**RESOLVED FURTHERMORE**, that close coordination and complementary management of the school by MBHTE and CFCST during the transition period should be earnestly observed, including assurance of sustainable financial support to the school by the Bangsamoro government after the transition period.

**RESOLVED FINALLY** that a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the Honorable Member of Parliament and MBHTE Minister Mohagher M. Iqbal for his consideration.
