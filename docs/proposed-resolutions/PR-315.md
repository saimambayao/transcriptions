**RESOLUTION**

**EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE IMMEDIATE PASSAGE OF SENATE BILL NO. 857, ENTITLED “AN ACT REORGANIZING THE OFFICES OF THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS AND RECLASSIFYING THE PLANTILLA POSITIONS IN THE AGENCY,” SEEKS TO STRENGTHEN THE FIELD OFFICES OF THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS (COMELEC)**

WHEREAS, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) is one of the independent Constitutional Commissions expressly created under the 1987 Constitution, whose primary duty is to enforce and administer election laws so that we may enjoy honest, orderly, and peaceful elections;

WHEREAS, the improvement in our election systems, the ever-growing increase in the number of registered voters, the introduction of the mandatory continuing registration system, and the other increasing administrative tasks of the Commission require an increased or strengthened workforce or personnel who are covered and protected by civil service laws and regulations;

WHEREAS, despite this constitutional independence, the power to create offices remains one of the legislative functions of Congress;

WHEREAS, as a result, the Commission’s power of appointment of competent civil service employees is restricted by the offices created by Congress, and the Commission is left with no better alternative but to hire contractual employees and issue job orders that threaten to undermine the rationale for civil service employment envision by our Constitution and existing laws;

WHEREAS, the present system of hiring contractual employees of the Commission is also prejudicial to the hired employees due to the disparity between their tasks and the compensation that the Commission can offer them;

WHEREAS, in the State’s pursuit for public officials and employees to be at all times accountable to the people and for them to discharge their duties with utmost responsibility, integrity, competence, and loyalty, and act with patriotism and justice, the State has the reciprocal burden to give these employees what is rightfully due to them;

WHEREAS, the House of Representatives, on 16 January 2021, approved on final reading House Bill No. 10579, seeking to strengthen field offices of the COMELEC by, among others, increasing the number of personnel in the field offices of the Commission;

WHEREAS, an equivalent Senate version, Senate Bill No. 857, a proposed act sponsored by Senator Ramon Bong Revilla, Jr. entitled “AN ACT REORGANIZING THE OFFICES OF THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS AND RECLASSIFYING THE PLANTILLA POSITIONS IN THE AGENCY,” is still pending in the Committee of the Senate;

WHEREAS, Senate Bill No. 857 similarly seeks to strengthen the field offices of the COMELEC by creating certain positions, reclassifying existing ones, and upgrading their salaries, amending for the purpose Section 53 of Batas Pambansa 881, or the Omnibus Election Code, as amended, and providing funds therefor;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved, to express support for the immediate passage of Senate Bill No. 857, entitled “AN ACT REORGANIZING THE OFFICES OF THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS AND RECLASSIFYING THE PLANTILLA POSITIONS IN THE AGENCY” that seeks to strengthen the field offices of the COMELEC;

**RESOLVED, FINALLY**, that copies of this resolution be furnished to the Office of the Senate President, the House of Representatives, and the Office of the Chief Minister.

**ADOPTED,**
