**WHEREAS,** Matling Industrial and Commercial Corporation or Matling was organized in 1928 and principally engaged in the milling of cassava tubers and the production of cassava starch and its principal place of business was in Barangay Matling, Malabang, Lanao del Sur, BARMM.

**WHEREAS,** on 29 May 1911, General Order No. 76 was issued, followed by Executive Order 1364 of William Howards Taft, president of the US, “Enlarging Torrey Barracks Reservation, Malabang, Mindanao Philippine Islands.”

**WHEREAS,** the above-mentioned General Order provided for conditions before the law could be invoked and that it shall be subject to private rights; that no property shall be taken or destroyed without first making payment therefore and the occupation or possession of the land required for the reservation must be extinguished by due process of law.

**WHEREAS,** some of these lands are ancestral in nature and therefore the rights of its occupant-owners must be respected.

**WHEREAS,** as of today there is no information that would suggest that Matling followed Executive Order No. 75 in its expansion program and no information that a validation and survey were conducted by the MAFAR that would cause the awarding of the subject land inside military reservation to Matling.

**WHEREAS,** the Bangsamoro Government is mandated by law to correct injustices inflicted upon the Moros, like the dispossession of their ancestral and legally owned land.

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved, by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, that the appropriate committee conduct an inquiry, in aid of legislation, on the alleged encroachment of private lands committed by Matling Industrial and Coporation (Matling).
