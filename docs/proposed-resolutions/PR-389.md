**A RESOLUTION URGING THE BARMM GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH (MOH) TO INSTITUTIONALIZE A PROGRAM ON CIRCUMCISSION FOR MALE LEARNERS IN ALL PUBLIC ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS, INCLUDING MADARIS, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**WHEREAS**, Section 22, Article IX of RA No. 11054, otherwise known as the “Bangsamoro Organic Law”, provides, that the Bangsamoro Government shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them;

**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Chapter I, Title V, of the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 13, otherwise known as the “Bangsamoro Administrative Code”, states that, the Ministry of Health (MOH) shall be primarily responsible for the formulation, planning, implementation and coordination of policies and programs for health. It shall promote, protect, preserve and restore the health of the people through the provision and delivery of health services through regulation and encouragement of providers of health goods and services.

**WHEREAS**, it appears from the result of our Medical Outreach Program (MOP): Free Circumcision, conducted last July 31 and August 2, 2023, we have catered a total of 1,162 patients for circumcision.

**WHEREAS**, notwithstanding the overwhelming number of afforded patients during our MOP, still, we had to deny a substantial number of possible patients, due to shortage in medicine and not enough manpower.

**WHEREAS**, circumcision reduces health risks by protecting males from sexually transmitted diseases, urinary tract infections, and other diseases affecting the reproductive organ.

**WHEREAS**, though not mentioned in the Holy Qur’an as a practice, circumcision is in accordance with cleanliness or purification which is a requirement in Islam.

**WHEREAS**, in the Philippines, circumcision is a social norm rooted in tradition that is followed by most Filipino communities. That being so, it is possible that a male individual may be subjected to bullying for not being circumcised. Hence, circumcision has a significant role in the psychological aspect of the development of a person.

**WHEREAS**, this resolution aims to provide awareness as to the importance and benefits of undergoing circumcision. Furthermore, this is to provide the Bangsamoro people access to affordable health services.

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Parliament – Bangsamoro Transition Authority of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao **A RESOLUTION URGING THE BARMM GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH (MOH) TO INSTITUTIONALIZE A PROGRAM ON CIRCUMCISSION FOR MALE LEARNERS IN ALL PUBLIC ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS, INCLUDING MADARIS, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**ADOPTED**, August ____, 2023.
