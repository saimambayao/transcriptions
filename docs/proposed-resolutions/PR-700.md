**WHEREAS**, Section 4, Article II of the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines states in part that “*The prime duty of the Government is to serve and protect the people*”, and Section 11, Article II, declares that “*The State values the dignity of every human person and guarantees full respect for human rights*”;

**WHEREAS**, Section 1, Article III of the Bill of Rights states that “*No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of laws*”;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Organic Law (Republic Act No. 11054), Article IX, underscores the importance of promoting and protecting human rights and commits to the establishment of mechanisms to ensure the dignity and safety of all individuals within the region;

**WHEREAS**, Section 6, Article IX of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (Republic Act No. 11054) explicitly provides that “*The Bangsamoro Government shall fully respect human rights*”;

**WHEREAS**, on March 17, 2025, Atty. Junisa Kimamao, a young and dedicated lawyer, was senselessly ambushed and killed in Maguindanao del Norte, and her fiancé, Atty. Ibrahim Pendatu, was critically injured in the attack;

**WHEREAS**, the police report from Datu Odin Sinsuat stated that Atty. Kimamao and Atty. Pendatu were aboard their vehicle traversing the highway of Barangay Awang, when they were shot by two gunmen aboard a motorcycle;

**WHEREAS**, Surah Al-Israh 33 states: “*Do not take a ‘human’ life—made sacred by Allah—except with ‘legal’ right. If anyone is killed unjustly, We have given their heirs the authority, but do not let them exceed limits in retaliation, for they are already supported ‘by law’.*”
