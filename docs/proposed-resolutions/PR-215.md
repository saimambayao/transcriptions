**WHEREAS**, by virtue of the passage of RA 11550 also known as *An Act Dividing the Province of Maguindanao into Two (2) Provinces, Namely: Maguindanao del Norte and Maguindanao del Sur*, the Province of Maguindanao was divided into two (2) distinct and independent provinces which brought about the need for the President to appoint OIC provincial chief executives in order to exercise the conferred powers and perform the concomitant responsibilities of such position as mandated by law.

**WHEREAS**, on September 17, 2022, during the Provincial Plebiscite, the majority of the people of Maguindanao province voted for “*yes*” as an answer to the question, “*Do you agree to divide the province of Maguindanao into two separate provinces to be known as Maguindanao del Norte and Maguindanao del Sur, in accordance with Republic Act No. 11550?*”
