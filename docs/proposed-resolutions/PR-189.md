**RESOLUTION**
**REQUIRING THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH TO PROVIDE A PROGRESS REPORT ON THE IMMUNIZATION OF BABIES AND CHILDREN IN BARMM AND TO PROVIDE AN ACTION PLAN FOR REACHING ITS TARGET IMMUNIZATION RATE**

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Government is mandated to protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them;

**WHEREAS**, the Ministry of Health is the ministry primarily responsible for the formulation, planning, implementation and coordination of policies and programs for health, and is mandated to promote, protect, preserve and restore the health of the people through the provision and delivery of health services through regulation and encouragement of providers of health goods and services;

**WHEREAS**, based on a 2019 BARMM Household Survey by the World Bank, only 34% of children aged 12-23 months received basic vaccine coverage, while 24% had no vaccine history at all;

**WHEREAS**, based on the report mentioned above, vaccine dropout is also a significant issue in BARMM where 25% to 50% of children who received first dose of vaccine antigen failed to receive the third doses in the series;

**WHEREAS**, while the ideal vaccination target in an area is 95% of all children, BARMM only managed to fully vaccinate around 61% of the eligible children based on the 2021 Field Health Services Information System of the Department of Health, which is also below the 63% national average;

**WHEREAS**, based on the abovementioned study by the World Bank, only 50% of the respondents heard about the importance of receiving all the recommended vaccines for their babies and children, and only 8.2% knew they had to return for the next doses of routine vaccination;

**WHEREAS**, immunization is vital in protecting babies and children from diseases which are already preventable by available vaccinations, and failure to do so may put their health at serious risk;

**NOW, THEREFORE,**

**BE IT RESOLVED**, as it hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to call on the Ministry of Health to provide its progress report on the immunization of babies and children in BARMM, including updates on its information drive campaign.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, to urge the Ministry of Health to furnish the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament of its action plans for reaching the target immunization rate of the region.

**RESOLVED FINALLY**, to send a copy of this Resolution to the Ministry of Health for their proper action.
