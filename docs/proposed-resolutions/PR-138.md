**A RESOLUTION STRONGLY REQUESTING THE CONGRESS OF THE PHILIPPINES THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY TO PASS A BILL CREATING A SEPARATE PROVINCE FOR THE SIXTY-THREE (63) BARANGAYS OF THE SPECIAL GEOGRAPHIC AREA (SGA)**

**WHEREAS,** the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides that:

*Section 10, Article X, Local Government - No province, city, municipality, or barangay may be created, divided, merged, abolished, or its boundaries substantially altered, except in accordance with the criteria established in the local government code and subject to approval by a majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite in the political units directly affected.*

*Section 11, Article X, Local Government - The Congress may, by law, create special metropolitan political subdivisions, subject to a plebiscite as set forth in Section 10 hereof. The component cities and municipalities shall retain their basic autonomy and shall be entitled to their local executive and legislative assemblies. The jurisdiction of the metropolitan authority that will thereby be created shall be limited to basic services requiring coordination.*

**WHEREAS,** the Local Government Code of 1991 provides that:

*Section 6, Authority to Create Local Government Units - A local government unit may be created, divided, merged, abolished, or its boundaries substantially altered either by law enacted by Congress in the case of a province, city, municipality, or any other political subdivision, or by ordinance passed by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan or Sangguniang Panlungsod concerned in the case of a Barangay located within its territorial jurisdiction, subject to such limitations and requirements prescribed in this Code.*

**WHEREAS,** Article VI, Section 10, Paragraph 3 of the Republic Act No. 11054 otherwise known as the "Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao" states that:

*"When such acts require the creation of a legislative district, the Bangsamoro Government shall cooperate and coordinate with the National Government through the Philippine Congress-Bangsamoro Parliament Forum to prioritize the deliberations on the creation of a legislative district".*

**WHEREAS,** the House of Representatives 19th Congress, First Regular Session, House amends law on urbanized cities, provinces par. 10 dated 16 September 2017 03:22:33 PM and Section 461, Requisites for Creation provides that:

*"On the formation of a province, the bill provides the following requirements: An average annual income of not less than P200 million for the last two consecutive years; and either of the following: A population of not less than 250,000 inhabitants or a contiguous territory of at least two thousand square kilometres.*

**WHEREAS,** Section 461 titled Requisites for Creation provides that (a) A province may be created if it has an average locally-generated annual income for the last two consecutive years, as certified by the Department of Finance, of not less than P200 million based on the year 2000 constant prices and either of the following requisites:

*"(i) A contiguous territory of at least 2,000 square kilometres, as certified by the Lands Management Bureau; or*

*"(ii) A population of not less than 250,000 inhabitants as certified by the PSA;*

"Provided, That the creation thereof shall not reduce the land area, population, and income of the original unit or units at the time of said creation to less than the minimum requirements prescribed herein.

"(b) The territorial jurisdiction of a newly-created province shall be properly identified by metes and bounds. The requirement on land area shall not apply where the province proposed to be created is composed of one or more islands. The territory need not be contiguous if it comprises two or more islands or is separated by a chartered city or cities which do not contribute to the income of the province.

"(c) The average annual locally-generated income shall include the income accruing to the general fund, exclusive of the IRA shares, special funds, trust funds, transfers, and non-recurring income."

**WHEREAS,** on January 20, 2019, the sixty-three (63) barangays of North Cotabato Province were officially turned over to the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) and were formed part of the Special Geographic Area (SGA). Consequently, they were dislodged from their previous province, the North Cotabato Province, leaving them with uncertainties and unclear identity.

**WHEREAS,** the urgency for the creation of a province for the SGA is sought since they can exist as a municipality only and not as a province. In addition to the proposed bill for the creation of eight (8) municipalities, it is urgently desired for the creation of the province.

**WHEREAS,** the creation of a province for the SGA met the necessary requirements provided for by law: an average annual income of not less than P200 million for the last two consecutive years and either a population of not less than 250,000 inhabitants or a contiguous territory of at least two thousand square kilometers.

**WHEREAS,** in view of the foregoing, it is imperative for the Bangsamoro Government to strongly request the Philippine Congress to pass a bill creating a separate Province for the above-mentioned 63 barangays.

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED,** to strongly request the Congress of the Philippines through the Government of the Day to pass a bill creating a separate Province for the Special Geographic Area (SGA).
