WHEREAS, disasters cause the destruction of communities, death of millions, and collapse of people’s livelihoods;¹

WHEREAS, the Philippines is one of the world’s most disaster-prone nations. The exposure of the Philippines to disasters can be attributed to its geographical and physical characteristics. Earthquakes are common and volcanoes abound because the country is in the Pacific Ring of Fire. The Philippines also absorbs the full strength of typhoons that develop in the Pacific Ocean;²
