WHEREAS, under Section 2 thereof, the “*Shari’ah courts within the Bangsamoro territorial jurisdiction shall form part of the Philippine judicial system subject to the supervision of the Supreme Court;*”

WHEREAS, the administrative functions of the Supreme Court are undertaken by the Supreme Court En Banc, “*assisted by the Office of the Clerk of Court in administrative matters and cases involving the Court and the collegial appellate courts, and by the Office of the Court in Administrative matters and cases involving the lower courts;*”

WHEREAS, Section 9 of Article X of the same law provides for the composition of the Shari'ah High Court, to wit: “*the Shari'ah High Court shall be composed of five (5) Justices, including the Presiding Justice;*”

WHEREAS, under Section 7, Article X of the BOL, the Shari’ah High Court in the Bangsamoro shall exercise appellate jurisdiction over Shari’ah Courts within and outside the region, and its decision “*shall be final and executory except on questions of law which may be raised before the Supreme Court xxx;*”
