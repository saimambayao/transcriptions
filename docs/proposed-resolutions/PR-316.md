**URGING THE STRICT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REPUBLIC ACT NO. 8485, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE ANIMAL WELFARE ACT, AS AMENDED, AND ENCOURAGING THE ADVOCACY OF STRAY ANIMAL ADOPTION PROGRAM IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO**

**WHEREAS**, Prophet Mohammad (*peace be upon him*) said in a Hadith: “*A good deed done to an animal is as meritorious as a good deed done to a human being, while an act of cruelty to an animal is as bad as an act of cruelty to a human being*”;

**WHEREAS**, in 1998, Congress enacted Republic Act No. 8485, which punishes cruelty to animals making it also unlawful for any person to abandon an animal under his custody or shall maltreat an animal;

**WHEREAS**, Section 5 thereof mandates the establishment of a Committee on Animal Welfare attached to the Department of Agriculture, which shall be responsible, subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, for the issuance of the necessary rules and regulations for the strict implementation of the provisions of the said Act;

**WHEREAS**, Section 6 thereof provides that “*it shall be unlawful for any person to xxx neglect to provide adequate care, xxx, kill or cause or procure to be tortured or deprived of adequate care, sustenance or shelter, xxx*”;

**WHEREAS**, Section 10 thereof empowers the Secretary of Agriculture to deputize animal welfare enforcement officers from non-government organizations, citizens groups, community organizations, and other volunteers who have undergone the necessary training for this purpose, with authority to seize and rescue illegally traded and maltreated animals and to arrest violators of this Act subject to the guidelines of existing laws and rules and regulations on arrest and detention;

**WHEREAS**, in the Bangsamoro Region, the PURPAWS (*People United to Rescue Pets that are Abused Wasted and Sick*) is a non-profit animal rescue organization based in Cotabato City that advocates animal compassion and adoption;

**WHEREAS**, based on the observation of PURPAWS, there is an increasing number of different animals being traded, sold, abandoned, or maltreated in the Region;

**WHEREAS**, stray animals are contributory health hazards to humans due to the spread of diseases like rabies, leptospirosis, and other parasites, including animal attacks;

**WHEREAS**, there is a need to establish more animal shelters in the Region;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority as follows:

**1.** For the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Agrarian Reform (MAFAR) to organize and establish a Committee on Animal Welfare and to strictly enforce the provisions of Republic Act No. 8485, as amended;

**2.** For MAFAR to lead the information campaign on the religious merits of treating animals kindly and the criminal liability that may be incurred under the Animal Welfare Act, as amended;

**3.** For MAFAR, in coordination with the Ministry of Interior and Local Government (MILG), to encourage the local government units in the BARMM to promote compassion for animals;

**4.** For MAFAR to seriously consider deputizing PURPAWS as one of the animal welfare enforcement officers in the Region;

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, that the Ministry of Interior and Local Government (MILG) shall urge LGUs to establish animal shelters to ensure the welfare of the animals in BARMM;

**RESOLVED, FINALLY**, that copies of this resolution be furnished to the MAFAR, MILG, and the PURPAWS for information and appropriate consideration.
