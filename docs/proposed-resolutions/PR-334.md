WHEREAS, Section 15, Article II of the 1987 Constitution declares the State’s policy to protect and promote the right to health of the people and to instill health consciousness among them;

WHEREAS, Section 22, Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), obliges the Bangsamoro Government to uphold the people’s right to have access to essential goods, health, and other social services that promote their well-being;

WHEREAS, Section 2, Chapter 1, Title V of the Bangsamoro Administrative Code provides that the MOH shall primarily be responsible for formulating, planning, implementing, and coordinating policies and programs for health. It shall promote, protect, preserve, and restore the health of the people through the provision and delivery of health services through regulation and encouragement of providers of health goods and services;

WHEREAS, according to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Guidelines for the Management of Snakebites, snakebites are well-known medical emergencies in many parts of the world, especially in rural areas;

WHEREAS, agricultural workers and children are the most affected, and studies show that rational use of snake anti-venom can substantially reduce mortality and morbidity due to snake bites;

WHEREAS, cobras are present in many types of terrain in the Philippines, from sea level to 1,800 meters elevation, with optimum habitat in grasslands, forests, swamps, and cultivated areas in Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago;

WHEREAS, Coral snakes and Sea snakes are typically found in Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago;

WHEREAS, bites of venomous snakes can result in a wide range of effects, from superficial puncture wounds to life-threatening illness and death;

WHEREAS, the BARMM is mainly an agricultural and fishery region where farmers and fisherfolks are at a high risk of snakebites which can cause permanent disability like blindness or restricted mobility, or death if there is no immediate access to healthcare antivenom and effective treatment;

WHEREAS, the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) houses the Purified Cobra Antivenin (PCAV), the only known effective antidote for snakebites, specifically those caused by the Philippine Cobra (*Naja philippinensis*);

WHEREAS, in an article published by Manila Bulletin in 2019, deaths by snakebites per year have been estimated to be around 250 persons;

WHEREAS, the clinical profile of snakebite patients admitted in RITM from July 1995-July 2000 results showed 79 snakebite patients were admitted at RITM; 97.5 percent were discharged improved, and 2.5 percent died;

WHEREAS, snakebite is a medical emergency that needs hospital management so that antivenom and emergency medical care can be administered;

WHEREAS, testimonies of several snakebite victims have shown that there is no adequate and readily available supply of Purified Cobra Antivenin (PCAV) in the Region;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved, by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to call on the Ministry of Health to ensure the establishment of accessible snake bite treatment centers and ensure the availability and adequate supply of Antivenin in each of the provinces of the Bangsamoro Region;
