**WHEREAS**, RA 10028 stipulates that "health, non-health facilities, establishments or institutions, including public places, shall establish lactation stations as appropriate," and these lactation stations are mandated to have adequate facilities that enable nursing mothers to collect milk or breastfeed their children in a conducive and private environment;
