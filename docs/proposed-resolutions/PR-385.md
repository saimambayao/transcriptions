**WHEREAS**, the Philippines is one of the United Nations member states that has committed in achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal No. 2, which provides, "*End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture*" by 2030;

**WHEREAS**, the Philippines has been experiencing food insecurity wherein 68.6 percent of Filipinos or about 75.2 million cannot afford a healthy diet in 2020;

**WHEREAS**, the 2019 Expanded National Nutrition Survey of Department of Science and Technology - Food and Nutrition Research Institute (DOST-FNRI) recorded that BARMM has 34.7% of the total households suffered from moderate food insecurity and 29.1% were not able to meet their basic food needs;

**WHEREAS**, the Philippine Development Plan, particularly in Chapter 3, states that “*Reduce Vulnerability and Protect Purchasing Power with the intended outcome of expanded access of consumers to affordable, safe, and nutritious food, and attainment of a sufficient and stable supply of food commodities*”;

**WHEREAS**, 2nd Paragraph of Section 22 of Article IX on Basic Rights of the RA 11054 otherwise known as Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao provides that “*Bangsamoro Government shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. It shall also uphold the people's right to have access to essential goods, health, and other social services that promote their well-being. xxx*”.

**WHEREAS**, a “healthy diet” is important to achieving a functioning and well-nourished body. It serves as the foundation for health, well-being, optimal growth, and development in all life stages in order to prevent all forms of malnutrition including undernutrition, such as wasting, stunting, underweight, or deficiencies in vitamins or minerals, and the risks of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) which includes heart diseases, diabetes, and certain types of cancers;

**WHEREAS**, despite the sustained economic improvement in the Bangsamoro Region, malnutrition and food insecurity remains a huge challenge. This challenge shall be addressed through timely information education campaign promoting diet that is healthy, inclusive, sustainable, affordable, and accessible to all;

**WHEREAS**, in view thereof, it is imperative for the Bangsamoro Government, its ministries, offices, and agencies, with the support of development partners including civil society organizations to strengthen its programs, projects, and activities on food security and nutrition that is consistent with the Bangsamoro Development Plan and Regional Plan of Action for Nutrition.

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the BTA Parliament, to urge the Bangsamoro Government to strengthen the promotion of sustainable, accessible, and affordable healthy diet for all Bangsamoro.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, that all member ministries and offices of the BARMM Regional Nutrition Committee shall coordinate, collaborate, and take the lead in strengthening the advocacy campaign, promotion, and implementation of respective nutrition sensitive and enabling programs embodied in the respective offices to support sustainable and affordable healthy diet.
