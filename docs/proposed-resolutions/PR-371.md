**WHEREAS**, a significant number of areas particularly in the outside core territories of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region were formerly owned and settled by the Bangsamoro since time immemorial;

**WHEREAS**, due to conflicts and other justifiable reasons, the affected Bangsamoro were forced to vacate their lands, and eventually occupied by squatters armed with documents such as but not limited to Certificate of Land Title (CLT) and Certificate of Land Ownership Award (CLOA) orchestrated by some individuals clothed with authority and influence in favor of the new occupants; and

**WHEREAS**, the realization of this noble proposal would be a milestone achievement of the Bangsamoro government in allusion to Section 12 (*Assistance to Other Bangsamoro Communities*), Article VI (*Intergovernmental Relations*) of the Bangsamoro Organic Law, which states that

> The National Government shall ensure the protection of the rights of the Bangsamoro people residing in communities outside the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region and undertake programs for their rehabilitation and development. The Bangsamoro Government, in coordination with the local government units where these communities are located and the appropriate national government agencies, shall provide assistance to enhance their economic, social and cultural development.

**NOW THEREFORE**, be it **RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Parliament, to enjoin the Bangsamoro Government to organize a legal assistance group under the Office of the Chief Minister to assist Bangsamoro who were illegally deprived of their lands, especially those located outside the core territories of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

**RESOLVED finally** to furnish the Honorable Ahod B. Ebrahim, Chief Minister, Bangsamoro Transition Authority, Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, a copy of this Resolution for his information and consideration on the matter.
