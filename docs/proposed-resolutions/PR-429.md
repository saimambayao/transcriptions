**RESOLUTION**

**URGING THE MINISTRY OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT (MSSD) TO APPRISE THE BANGSAMORO PARLIAMENT ON THE STATUS OF THE ORPHANAGES IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM)**

**WHEREAS**, Section 13, Article II of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides that the State recognizes the vital role of the youth in nation-building and shall promote and protect their physical, moral, spiritual, intellectual, and social well-being;

**WHEREAS**, Section 3 Paragraph 2, Article XV of the Constitution specifically provides that the State shall defend the right of children to assistance, including proper care and nutrition, and special protection from all forms of neglect, abuse, cruelty, exploitation, and other conditions prejudicial to their development;

**WHEREAS**, Section 14, Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall respect, protect, and promote the rights of children, especially orphans of tender age. They shall be protected from exploitation, abuse, or discrimination. Their education and development, both physical and mental, shall be fully addressed;

**WHEREAS**, the same provision states that Bangsamoro policies and programs shall take into utmost consideration the best interest of children, and promote and protect the rights of children, youth, and adolescents, including their survival and development;

**WHEREAS**, orphanages serve a crucial role in society and play an important part in the lives of children who have lost parental care or are abandoned;

**WHEREAS**, orphanages provide a safe and stable environment for children, ensuring that their basic needs such as food, shelter, clothing, and healthcare are met, and offering a supportive living space where children who are abused, neglected, and abandoned can thrive and grow;

**WHEREAS**, according to a study conducted by The Asia Foundation entitled “Children of War”, there are no Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD)-accredited orphanages or shelters in the Bangsamoro. Instead, many Muslim orphans handled by the DSWD in Mindanao are often sent to orphanages in Manila¹;

**WHEREAS**, the Ministry of Social Services and Development (MSSD), one of the ministries and offices in BARMM created by virtue of the BOL, is mandated to provide a balanced and responsive approach to social welfare whereby the rights, needs, and interests of all citizens within its jurisdiction, with special focus on the marginalized and vulnerable sectors, including women, children, senior citizens, differently-abled persons, indigenous cultural communities, internally displaced persons, and those similarly situated by analogy, are protected and addressed at all times, especially during the existence of a crisis, whether natural or human-induced, that affects their well-being and their participation in community affairs²;

**WHEREAS**, two (2) of the Ministry’s objectives are:

1) to provide an integrated welfare package to its constituents, on the basis of their rights, needs, and interests, and coordinate the service facilities required from such ministries or agencies, governmental and non-governmental, or local government units, which can best provide them; and

2) to care for, protect, and rehabilitate, differently-abled persons, as well as those who are socially disadvantaged, for effective social functioning.

**WHEREAS**, there is a need to establish and maintain a comprehensive and updated database of orphanages in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) to facilitate access to information and support for orphaned children in the region;

**WHEREAS**, a centralized database will enable government agencies, non-profit organizations, and other concerned stakeholders to efficiently identify and collaborate with orphanages to provide necessary assistance and support;

**WHEREAS**, this database will serve as a valuable resource for tracking and monitoring the welfare of orphaned children, ensuring that they receive appropriate care and services; and

**WHEREAS**, it is imperative for the Bangsamoro Parliament, as the interim government and policy-making body of BARMM, to be equipped with updated and crucial information about orphanages in the BARMM, which can support in its policy-formulation and decision-making related to protection and promotion of the rights of the children who are orphaned, abused, neglected, or abandoned in the Bangsamoro region.

**WHEREAS**, the Ministry Social Services and Development should share the processed data to the Bangsamoro Parliament to inform policy-making;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the Bangsamoro Parliament to pass and approve this Resolution urging the Ministry Social Services and Development to apprise the Bangsamoro Parliament on the status of the orphanages in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao .

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, that a copy of this Resolution be furnished to the Ministry of Social Services and Development, for information and appropriate action.

Adopted,
