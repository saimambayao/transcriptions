**A RESOLUTION**

**EXPRESSING SUPPORT TO THE MINDANAO STATE UNIVERSITY-COLLEGE OF LAW IN ITS FIGHT TO CONTINUE PROVIDING LEGAL EDUCATION FOR THE BANGSAMOROS**

WHEREAS, the Congress of the Philippines in 1955 enacted the Charter of the Mindanao State University, the Republic Act No. 1387 as amended;

WHEREAS, under Section 6 (b) of RA 1387, it mandates the establishment of a College of Law by the Mindanao State University (MSU) Board of Regents;

WHEREAS, in 1981, the MSU Board of Regents established the MSU- College of Law;

WHEREAS, since its establishment, the MSU- College of Law has produced members of the legal profession who have served not only Mindanao but the entire country with distinction, advancing justice and upholding the rule of law;

WHEREAS, graduates of the MSU-College of Law have significantly contributed to the establishment of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, have actively participated from the negotiation phase up until the present crafting of crucial legislations by the Bangsamoro Parliament;

WHEREAS, the Legal Education Board (LEB) has issued Resolution No. 231-18 canceling the accreditation of the law program of MSU- College of Law and ordering the closure of its program in all campuses effective Academic Year 2025-2026;

WHEREAS, the closure order issued by the LEB curtails access to legal education for the Bangsamoros community, particularly affecting underprivileged students who have limited opportunities to pursue legal studies in other institutions;

WHEREAS, the continued operation of the MSU-College of Law, along with its commitment to realizing its vision of producing competent legal professionals, is of paramount importance. These lawyers, who possess knowledge of both Philippine laws and Islamic Personal Laws, as well as a comprehensive understanding of the historical, cultural, and legal foundations of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), play a critical role in ensuring the stability, governance, and legal integrity of BARMM;

WHEREAS, the closure of MSU's College of Law may impede progress and have far-reaching consequences for the BARMM region;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved, by the Bangsamoro Parliament to express its support for the Mindanao State University (MSU)-College of Law in its fight to continue providing legal education for the Bangsamoros;
