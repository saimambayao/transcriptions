**WHEREAS**, the people working for the government must be accountable to the people whom they swore to serve with honesty and integrity; and

**WHEREAS**, in the interest of Moral Governance, the Bangsamoro Government should remind and enforce the implementation and observance of the COA Circular 2012-003 in order to preserve public interest, promote a more efficient and effective use of public resources and thereby preventing undue waste of government funds.
