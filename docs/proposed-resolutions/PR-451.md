**RESOLUTION TO HUMBLY AND EARNESTLY APPEAL TO HIS EXCELLENCY FERDINAND R. MARCOS, JR. TO GRANT PRESIDENTIAL ABSOLUTE PARDON TO FORMER ARMM GOVERNOR DATU ZACARIA CANDAO, DR. ABAS CANDAO, MR. ISRAEL HARON**

**WHEREAS**, Datu Zacaria Candao, his brother Dr. Abas Candao and Mr. Israel Haron were convicted of Malversation in 2009¹ for acts committed during the latter’s tenure as Governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao² and both have been incarcerated at the Bilibid National Penitentiary since 2011;

**WHEREAS**, Datu Zacaria Candao, now 80 years old and Dr. Abas Candao, now 77 years old, are presently in frail physical health;

**WHEREAS**, prior to their conviction, Datu Zacaria together with Dr. Abas³, as prominent figures in the Bangsamoro movement, spent decades fighting for peace in Mindanao, risking life and limb, exhausting all legal means and private resources, representing multi factions of the Muslim community in endless negotiations - all without personal gain;

**WHEREAS**, it cannot be denied that the efforts of Datu Zacaria were hugely instrumental in ending the Mindanao conflict⁴, saving thousands of lives, bringing peace to hundreds of communities, alleviating the lives of Muslims throughout Mindanao and bringing their aspirations for a better life to fruition;

**WHEREAS**, it also cannot be denied that the malversation charges against Datu Zacaria resulted from the lapses of the administrative staff of the then newly-formed Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao, and that aside from having endorsed the checks, there was no evidence of where, how and who actually benefited from the unaccounted funds⁵;

**WHEREAS**, the truth is that even during his term as ARMM Governor, Datu Zacaria relentlessly continued his peace and order campaign and maintained unofficial ties with many different sectors in the Muslim community in order to foster peaceful co-existence amongst them, and to salvage or safeguard peace agreements, with expenditures that cannot be accounted for in the conventional form;

**WHEREAS**, while the Supreme Court has already passed on the malversation cases against Datu Zacaria and Dr. Abas and there is no point in revisiting the same, it is grossly unfair that their excessive long prison sentences not, at the very least, be mitigated by their lifelong efforts which resulted in a more peaceful Mindanao – a gargantuan task that has eluded the government through several administrations for more than 50 years, and an outcome that cannot be measured in terms of money alone;

**WHEREAS**, Datu Zacaria, Dr. Abas and Mr. Israel Haron, while considered in hiding and are fugitives from justice are certainly suffering from their deprivation of mobility experiencing grave remorse for their oversight in the conduct of the administrative affairs of the ARMM during the latter’s tenure as Governor;

**WHEREAS**, Datu Zacaria and Dr. Abas are both professionals, being a lawyer and doctor, respectively, and despite their convictions, are honorable men at its most basic definition, and hence, never did and do not constitute threat of any kind, manner or form to the government or society at large;

**WHEREAS**, justice has already prevailed and further incarceration can no longer punish Dr. Zacaria, Dr. Abas and Israel Haron more than they have already suffered as fugitives and granting them Pardon under the context of the normalization process⁶ under the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro will give credence to the process of healing and transitional justice objective of the normalization process;

**WHEREAS**, in addition to all the foregoing, our innate humanity may recognize that Datu Zacaria and Dr. Abas, like all men, just want to be relieved of their darkest hours, live out the short remainder of their lives and finally, to die as free men, surrounded by family and friends;

**WHEREAS**, it is hoped that as a son who endured the agony of watching his own father wither away and die in a foreign land, your Excellency may take mercy on Datu Zacaria, Dr. Abas and Mr. Israel Haron before it is too late for them as well;

**WHEREAS**, forgiveness is a divine attribute, that in pardoning Dr. Zacaria and Dr. Abas, can only be construed as a further recognition of the aspirations of the Moro community which they have peacefully served for most of their lives;

**WHEREAS**, absolute pardon has been granted to murderers, plunderers of more substantial amounts and coup plotters who caused many deaths and directly and frontally attempted to topple the government⁷;

**WHEREAS**, your Excellency has the sole power, discretion and authority to grant absolute pardon to Datu Zacaria Candao and Dr. Abas Candao⁸, upon the recommendation of the Bureau of Pardons and Parole, which has favorably endorsed it;

**NOW RESOLVED**, be it –

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved, to humbly and earnestly appeal to His Excellency Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. to grant presidential clemency and absolute pardon to ex-ARMM Governor Datu Zacaria Candao, his brother, then former ARMM Executive Secretary Dr. Abas Candao and Mr. Israel Haron.
