**A RESOLUTION REQUESTING THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MINISTER HON. AHOD BALAWAG EBRAHIM TO GRANT INFLATION RELIEF ASSISTANCE OF AT LEAST TEN THOUSAND PESOS (₱10,000) TO ALL EMPLOYEES OF THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT, REGARDLESS OF EMPLOYMENT STATUS, INCLUDING PERSONS ENGAGED UNDER CONTRACTS OF SERVICE AND JOB ORDERS, TO BE RELEASED DURING THE MONTH OF RAMADHAN 1446, SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS**

**WHEREAS**, the Holy Month of Ramadhan is expected to commence on or after February 28, 2025 (29 Shabaan 1446);

**WHEREAS**, Ramadhan is a sacred and significant period for Muslims worldwide, observed with fasting, prayers, and communal reflection, bringing spiritual and communal blessings;

**WHEREAS**, the observance of Ramadhan entails additional financial obligations, including increased spending on food and other essential goods, which are further exacerbated by inflation and seasonal price surges;

**WHEREAS**, the rise in commodity prices during Ramadhan affects not only Muslims observing the fast but also the general population of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS**, granting additional financial assistance to employees of the Bangsamoro Government will help mitigate the financial burden faced by public sector workers, particularly those in lower income brackets, during this period;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Government has previously provided similar financial assistance during Ramadhan, demonstrating its commitment to the welfare of its employees and constituents;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to respectfully request the Office of the Chief Minister, Hon. Ahod Balawag Ebrahim, to grant an inflation relief assistance of at least Ten Thousand Pesos (₱10,000) to all employees of the Bangsamoro Government, regardless of employment status, including individuals engaged under contracts of service and job orders, to be released during the Holy Month of Ramadhan 1446, subject to the availability of funds;

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, that a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to the Honorable Chief Minister Ahod Balawag Ebrahim for his information and appropriate action.
