**A RESOLUTION DECLARING SITIO MEKIR IN BARANGAY LAMUD, SOUTH UPI, MAGUINDANAO DEL SUR AS A PEACE SANCTUARY AND SAFE EVACUATION CENTER FOR NON-MORO INDIGENOUS PEOPLES DURING ARMED HOSTILITIES**

**WHEREAS**, the Teduray and Lambangian tribes' traditional territory (*fusaka ingëd*) is the foundation of their economic, social, cultural, and political life, entrusted by the Creator (*Tulus*) to be protected and passed on to future generations;

**WHEREAS**, this territory is not only a source of shelter and nourishment but also a place where these tribes govern themselves, practice customary laws, and establish their own political, justice, and defence systems, in accordance with **Republic Act No. 8371 or the Indigenous Peoples’ Rights Act (IPRA) of 1997**, which recognizes the rights to ancestral domains (Section 4), self-governance (Section 7), and protection in times of armed conflict (Section 15);

**WHEREAS**, Section 22, Article II and Section 5, Article XII of the **1987 Philippine Constitution** affirm the recognition and protection of Indigenous Cultural Communities and their ancestral lands;

**WHEREAS**, the **Bangsamoro Organic Law (Republic Act No. 11054)**, particularly Article IX, Section 12, guarantees the rights of Non-Moro Indigenous Peoples (NMIPs) within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, including their right to ancestral domains and self-governance, and the protection of their culture and traditions;

**WHEREAS**, the **Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB)** and the **Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro (FAB)** commit the Bangsamoro Government to respect human rights, including the rights of Indigenous Peoples, and uphold humanitarian protection during conflict;

**WHEREAS**, international instruments such as the **United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)** affirm the rights of Indigenous Peoples to life, integrity, security, and protection of their ancestral territories (Articles 7, 10, 26, and 30), including the right to be free from militarization or forced displacement;

**WHEREAS**, the **Fourth Geneva Convention (1949)** mandates the protection of civilians during armed conflict, including the establishment of safe zones or evacuation centers for vulnerable populations;

**WHEREAS**, the **International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)** provides that ethnic and Indigenous minorities shall not be denied the right to enjoy their own culture or to live securely within their communities (Article 27);

**WHEREAS**, the spiritual and political leadership of the Teduray and Lambangian Peoples, including the *Këmamal Këadatan*, uphold traditional peacekeeping and governance systems that sustain harmony, social justice, and community welfare, grounded in Indigenous worldviews and sacred rituals;

**WHEREAS**, the Indigenous concept of "**Mëginëknëk Bation**", meaning peace sanctuary, is an essential traditional institution that provides refuge and spiritual restoration during periods of conflict and distress;

**WHEREAS**, on July 26, 2023, armed hostilities in the area resulted in the displacement of approximately 579 families or 2,300 individuals—primarily Non-Moro Indigenous Peoples—underscoring the need for a safe and designated evacuation area in times of violence;

**WHEREAS**, this declaration aligns with the **Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010 (Republic Act No. 10121)**, which mandates the protection of marginalized and vulnerable groups, including Indigenous Peoples, in disaster and emergency situations;

**WHEREAS**, in the absence of a formal peace process between conflicting armed groups, establishing Sitio Mekir as a peace sanctuary offers a community-driven protection mechanism consistent with the **whole-of-nation approach** under the **National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC)**, adapted within the BARMM context;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Parliament of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, to declare **Sitio Mekir in Barangay Lamud, South Upi, Maguindanao del Sur, as a Peace Sanctuary and Safe Evacuation Center for Non-Moro Indigenous Peoples during armed hostilities;**

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, that the Bangsamoro Government, through its relevant ministries such as the **Ministry of Indigenous Peoples’ Affairs (MIPA)**, the **Ministry of Public Order and Safety (MPOS)**, the **Bangsamoro Human Rights Commission (BHRC)**, and local government units (LGUs), coordinate with national agencies, civil society organizations, and traditional leadership structures to institutionalize the protection, development, and cultural preservation of this peace sanctuary.

Adopted this ____ day of ____________, 2025 at the Bangsamoro Parliament Hall, Bangsamoro Government Center, Cotabato City.
