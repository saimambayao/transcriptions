**RESOLUTION**

**URGING THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO ALLOCATE FUNDS FOR THE HIRING OF A DEDICATED BARANGAY JUSTICE SECRETARY FOR THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTATION NEEDED FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE KATARUNGANG PAMBARANGAY**

**WHEREAS**, Section 6, Article IV of Republic Act 11054, otherwise known as the “Bangsamoro Organic Law” states that the Bangsamoro Government shall promote unity, peace, justice, and goodwill among all peoples, as well as encourage a just and peaceful settlement of disputes;

**WHEREAS**, Chapter VII, Title I, Book III of Republic Act 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Act of 1991, provides for a system of settling disputes or differences operating in all barangays in the country with the objective to promote, among others, the speedy and effective administration of justice, by laying the ways to amicably resolve personal and family differences among barangay members which considerably reduced the bloating of court dockets¹;

**WHEREAS**, in a report filed by then Department of Interior and Local Government Secretary Mar Roxas, in 2014, the government has realized an estimated savings of P3.1-billion in court litigation costs through the implementation of the barangay justice system or Katarungang Pambarangay with an estimated cost of adjudication per case at Php 9,500.00²;

**WHEREAS**, the Revised Katarungang Pambarangay Law provides that the barangay secretary shall concurrently serve as the secretary of the lupon. He shall record the results of mediation proceedings before the punong barangay and shall submit a report thereon to the proper city or municipal courts. He shall also receive and keep the records of proceedings submitted to him by the various conciliation panels³;

**WHEREAS**, this added function of the Barangay Secretary hampers the necessary documentation of proceedings in the implementation of the Katarungang Pambarangay, as the Barangay Secretaries would prioritize the functions vested to them in Sec. 394 of RA 7160, which is already hefty to begin with, due to the lack of material time to perform other tasks and duties;

**WHEREAS**, the documentation of all steps in the implementation of the Katarungang Pambarangay is essential in the evaluation of the efficacy of this law as well as to court proceedings which have gone through the prerequisite of barangay mediation;

**WHEREAS**, in a series of consultations made with the Majority of Barangay Units in Cotabato City, one of the highly urbanized cities in the region, it was observed that most if not all barangay units fail completely to lodge all the disputes being brought to them by their constituents for lack of time and manpower for documenting said mediation proceedings;

**WHEREAS**, this misstep in recording the proceedings leads to an inaccurate appraisal of the effectiveness of the Katarungang Pambarangay system, especially in our region, which boasts a myriad of traditional and contemporary modes of settling disputes without the need for court intervention;

**WHEREAS**, it is only appropriate that a new barangay position be opened in every Barangay Unit in the Bangsamoro to be dedicated solely for the purposes of recording the results of mediation proceedings before the punong barangay, for submitting a report thereon to the proper city or municipal courts, and for receiving and keeping the records of proceedings submitted by the various conciliation panels⁴;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, BY THE PARLIAMENT, to pass and approve this resolution urging the Ministry of Interior and Local Government (MILG) to allocate funds for the hiring of a dedicated barangay justice secretary for the necessary documentation needed for the implementation of the Revised Katarungang Pambarangay Law.
