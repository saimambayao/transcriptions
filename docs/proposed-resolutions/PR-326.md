**RESOLUTION**

**URGING THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH TO CONDUCT AWARENESS CAMPAIGN ON THE HEALTH RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE AND CONSUMPTION OF BETEL NUT OR “MAMAH” IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM)**

**WHEREAS**, **Section 15**, Article II of the 1987 Constitution guarantees the protection and promotion of “*the right to health of the people*” and mandates the State to “*instill health consciousness among them*”;

**WHEREAS**, **Section 3**, Article V of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), provides that “*the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare*”;

**WHEREAS**, **Section 22**, Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054, provides that “*the Bangsamoro Government shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. It shall also uphold the peoples’ right to have access to essential goods, health, and other social services that promote their well-being*”;

**WHEREAS**, the Betel Nut (“*Momah*” or “*Mamah*”) is a betel nut and leaf concoction or quid with tobacco, the chewing of which produces blood-red spittle. The practice of betel chewing used to be prevalent throughout the Philippines, from the mountains in the north to the Muslim communities in the south. The tribal people of the Cordillera, commonly called Igorots, carry their containers around their waists or in little baskets specially made to parcel betel. Most of the men, especially the older ones, chew betel constantly;

**WHEREAS**, according to a research article made in Zamboanga City which was published in 2019, the use of betel nut is a health risk among frequent chewers, and it can lead to oral submucous fibrosis, which is attributed to the presence of the active alkaloid arecoline present in the betel nut - individuals with oral submucous fibrosis are at high-risk for precancerous conditions which may develop into malignancy at a rate of 7.6%;

**WHEREAS**, a study made by the World Health Organization (WHO) shows that the International Agency for Cancer Research classifies betel nut as a Group 1 carcinogen. Smokeless tobacco use is associated with cancers of the oral cavity, pancreas, and esophagus. The nicotine in tobacco also leads to addiction, making it more difficult to give up the betel nut chewing when mixed with tobacco;

**WHEREAS**, a technical report has been published by WHO in 2012, which establishes a platform of action in the control of betel nut and tobacco use;

**WHEREAS**, up to this date, there are no existing laws that regulate the use of betel nut or mama within the BARMM area even though one of the components in betel nut use is tobacco which is being regulated under R.A. 9211;

**WHEREAS**, in view of the use of Betel Nut (“Momah or Mamah”) within the localities and provinces of the Bangsamoro, the government has to take necessary measures to regulate the use of betel nut, thus preventing higher health risks and promote the health consciousness among the constituents;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it RESOLVED, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Parliament, TO URGE THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH TO CONDUCT AWARENESS CAMPAIGN ON THE HEALTH RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE AND CONSUMPTION OF BETEL NUT OR “MAMAH” IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM);**

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, that a copy of this resolution be furnished to the Office of the Minister of Ministry of Health.
