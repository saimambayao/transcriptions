**"A RESOLUTION STRENGTHENING THE SECURITY IN COTABATO CITY BY URGING THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO ASSIST THE PHILIPPINE NATIONAL POLICE - COTABATO CITY IN SEARCHING FOR A PARCEL OF LAND WHERE THE TWO ADDITIONAL POLICE STATIONS OF COTABATO CITY MAY BE BUILT"**

WHEREAS, Section 3, Article V of the Bangsamoro Organic Law, the general welfare clause, provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among others, the [maintenance] of peace and order and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants;

WHEREAS, the regional seat of the Bangsamoro Government is in Cotabato City where it only has four (4) police stations for its population of 325,079;

WHEREAS, through General Order Number DPL-18-25 pursuant to NAPOLCOM Resolution No. 2019-1032 dated December 27, 2019, the National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM) provided for the restructuring and strengthening of units of city police offices including the City Police Office in Cotabato City;

WHEREAS, included in the said Order is the creation of two (2) additional police stations in Cotabato City which shall augment the already existing four (4) police stations in the City;

WHEREAS, the two (2) additional police stations have not yet been built until the present because while the Department of Budget and Management has approved its budget, there is no identified parcel of land yet where the said buildings or police stations may be built, despite the earnest efforts of searching by the Cotabato City Police Office.

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, to strengthen the security in Cotabato City by extending assistance to PNP-Cotabato City in searching for a parcel of land where the two additional police stations of Cotabato City may be built.
