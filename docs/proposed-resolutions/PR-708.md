**WHEREAS**, the Special Geographic Area (SGA) was sub-divided into eight (8) municipalities, namely: Pahamuddin, Kadayangan, Nabalawag, Old Kaabakan, Kapalawan, Malidegao, Tugunan and Ligawasan by virtue of Bangsamoro Autonomous Act (BAA) Nos. 41 to 48, s. 2023 in that order, and duly ratified in a plebiscite on April 13, 2024;

**WHEREAS**, Bangsamoro Resolution Number (BRN) 499 requesting the Honorable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives, and likewise the Honorable President and Members of the Senate to create the Special Geographic Area into a province called **Kutawato Province** has been passed by the BTA Parliament on September 27, 2024;

**WHEREAS**, in direct response to BRN 499, s. 2024, the honorable Senator Robin C. Padilla filed Senate Bill No. 2857 in November 2024 and the honorable Congressman Raymund Democrito C. Mendoza with his House Bill No. 11177 in January 2025, both proposing for the creation of the “Kutawato Province” from the Special Geographic Area;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro government, upon invitation by the Senate Committee on Local Governments during its public hearing on Hon. Padilla’s Senate Bill No. 2957 at the Senate of the Philippines, GSIS Bldg., Financial Center, Diokno Blvd., Pasay City, Philippines, on December 4, 2024, proposed instead that the SGA be renamed into **“Moro Province”** to avoid confusion with Cotabato Province; and

**WHEREAS**, in allusion to the ruling of the Philippine Congress that a Senate or House Bill or Resolution that languished in the past congress may be refiled with the new congress, and in cognizance of the Bangsamoro government’s proposed **Moro Province** for SGA instead of Kutawato Province, there is an urgent need for the Bangsamoro Parliament to pass a resolution to these effects.

**NOW THEREFORE**, for and in consideration of the foregoing,

**BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED** by the BTA Parliament to request the Honorable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives, and also the Honorable President and Members of the Senate to sponsor and enact a law creating a province called **Moro Province** and a Congressional District for the Special Geographic Area, Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.
