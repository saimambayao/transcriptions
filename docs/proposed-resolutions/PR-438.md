**A RESOLUTION URGING THE COMMITTEE ON RULES OF THE BANGSAMORO PARLIAMENT TO PROMULGATE GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES IN ALLOWING REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS IN THE BANGSAMORO TO ATTEND AND PARTICIPATE IN THE BANGSAMORO PARLIAMENT SESSIONS WITHOUT VOTING POWER**

**WHEREAS**, Section 3 of the Bangsamoro Organic Law provides that the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region shall have a democratic political system that allows its people to freely participate in the political processes within its territorial jurisdiction;

**WHEREAS**, the importance of engaging civil society organizations (CSOs) in the democratic process and valuing their contributions to the Bangsamoro region are manifestations of people-empowering governance;

**WHEREAS**, it is essential to foster an inclusive and participatory governance system that allows for the input and representation of various sectors and stakeholders in the decision-making processes of the Bangsamoro Parliament;

**WHEREAS**, the CSO’s role is crucial to ensure that the voices of marginalized and vulnerable populations are heard and taken into account. They also provide a platform for Bangsamoro people to voice their concerns and advocate for their rights and can help to create an environment of greater transparency and accountability in the political process;

**WHEREAS**, in order to facilitate transparency, promote inclusivity, and strengthen the dialogue between the Bangsamoro government and the civil society sector, there is a need to establish a mechanism for the participation of the CSOs in the parliamentary process with the following guidelines for consideration of the Committee on Rules:

1. A qualified representative from a recognized and accredited CSO shall be granted access to attend and participate in the Bangsamoro Parliament sessions as a non-voting member.

2. The CSO representative shall have the right to speak on matters related to the welfare and development of the Bangsamoro region during the parliamentary sessions. They shall be given the opportunity to present their perspectives, insights, and recommendations on legislative issues.

3. The CSO representative shall be required to register with the Parliament Secretariat in advance to attend a particular session. The Secretariat shall provide the necessary guidelines and procedures for registration.

4. The CSO representative shall be granted a designated seat within the parliamentary chamber, appropriately marked to indicate their non-voting status. The CSO representative shall have access to parliamentary documents, reports, and other relevant information necessary for their informed participation.

5. The CSO representative shall not be entitled to vote on any parliamentary matters. However, their presence and input shall be duly acknowledged and taken into consideration by the lawmakers during the decision-making process.

6. The CSO representative shall adhere to the parliamentary code of conduct and shall conduct themselves with professionalism and respect towards the parliamentary proceedings and its members.

**WHEREAS**, granting a qualified CSO representative the opportunity to attend and actively participate in the Bangsamoro Parliament sessions would promote transparency, accountability, and moral governance;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED** by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority to urge the Committee on Rules to issue guidelines and procedures in allowing the participation of the representatives of the Civil Society Organizations in the Bangsamoro Parliament sessions.

Adopted,
