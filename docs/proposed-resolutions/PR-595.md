**WHEREAS**, The Ministry of the Local Government (MILG) is mandated to assist the Chief Minister in the regulation of its constituent local governments to ensure that their affairs are within the scope of their powers and functions²;

**WHEREAS**, previous legislation such as Republic Act No. 9513, or the Renewable Energy Act of 2008, have long promoted the increased utilization of Renewable Energy³;

**WHEREAS**, if such continued growth is left unchecked, dependency towards non-renewable energy may continue and increase;

**WHEREAS**, Solar photovoltaic (PV) generation has great potential and has been the most attractive renewable energy source amongst the Southeast Asian nations⁴;

**WHEREAS**, for 2023, Southeast Asia’s continued focus with renewable energy is reflected in the region’s 20% increase in adoption and use in just a year⁵;

**WHEREAS**, Southeast Asia is home to some of the world’s fastest-growing economies. As energy grows, the region is turning to renewable energy to safeguard its energy security⁶;

**WHEREAS**, global efforts in combating climate change have placed a renowned emphasis on sustainable development;

**WHEREAS**, developed states such as California in the United States have successfully implemented mandatory Solar Planning for new homes, exemplifying the feasibility of such a policy⁷;

**WHEREAS**, the adoption of a Solar Electrification Plan can showcase and exemplify the Bangsamoro’s commitment in adopting Sustainable Development Goals;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the BTA Parliament, to pass and approve this Resolution urging the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources and Energy (MENRE) in coordination with the concerned ministries to prepare a comprehensive solar electrification plan for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.
