**WHEREAS**, on the early hours of February 6, 2023 while people were inside their homes and sleeping an earthquake with 7.8 magnitude struck Turkey and Syria;

**WHEREAS**, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the epicenter of the 7.8-magnitude earthquake was 23 kilometers east of Nurdagi, in Turkey’s Gaziantep province, at a depth of 24.1 kilometers. The preliminary location of the earthquake places it within the vicinity of a triple junction between the Anatolian, Arabian, and African plates;

**WHEREAS**, according to CNBC News article that was published on Monday, February 13 2023 7:46 AM the combined death toll in Turkey and neighboring Syria exceeds 41,000 leaving other thousand injured in the disaster.

**WHEREAS**, the earthquake and powerful aftershocks also cut a swath of destruction that stretched hundreds of kilometers (miles) across southeastern Turkey and neighboring Syria. The shaking toppled thousands of buildings and heaped more misery on a region wracked by Syria’s 12-year civil war and refugee crisis;

**WHEREAS**, World Health Organization (WHO) estimates up to 23 million people could be affected by the earthquake across both countries. Search and rescue efforts are still underway, bolstered by aid groups and countries that have rushed teams to the worst-hit areas, but they are battling grim conditions with thousands of collapsed buildings and freezing temperatures;

**WHEREAS**, The Government of the day together with tens of millions of people around the world mourns the loss of so many lives and offers its deepest condolences to the bereaved loved ones of those that are departed, and may Allah (s.w.t) protect the remaining people in the affected regions, and ease the pain they are currently facing;
