WHEREAS, Section 5, Article II of the 1987 Constitution provides that the maintenance of peace and order, the protection of life, liberty, and property, and the promotion of the general welfare are essential for the enjoyment by all the people of the blessings of democracy;

WHEREAS, Section 2 of the Republic Act No. 10817, or the Act Instituting the Philippine Halal Export Development and Promotion Program Creating for the Purpose the Philippine Halal Export Development and Promotion Board, and for Other Purposes, declares that it is the policy of the State to develop and promote Halal industries as a mode of achieving equity and justice among our farmers and producers, and increasing employment opportunities for the domestic labor force;

WHEREAS, Section 2, Article IV of the Republic Act No. 11054, also known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), states that in the exercise of its right to self-governance, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is free to pursue its political, economic, social, and cultural development as provided for in this Organic Law;

WHEREAS, Section 3, Article V of the aforementioned law provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants;

WHEREAS, Section 30, Article XIII of the same law states that the Parliament shall enact laws to further strengthen its policy and programs on halal development;

WHEREAS, Section 3, Title XIV of the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act (BAA) No. 13, or the Bangsamoro Administrative Code, mandates the Ministry of Trade, Investments, and Tourism (MTIT) to coordinate with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Agrarian Reform (MAFAR), and other concerned agencies in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) in the development and promotion of halal industry;

WHEREAS, Section 3, Title XII of the same code mandates the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) to contribute to the development and quality standards including Halal for food and non-food industry through testing, analysis, and capacity-building;

WHEREAS, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Briefing states that BARMM has the potential to be a Halal hub in the Philippines since it has the largest concentration of Muslims in the country and its strategic location in the southern part of the Philippines, close to the large Muslim markets of Indonesia and Malaysia¹;

WHEREAS, the MAFAR has intensified its activities aimed to strengthen the Halal food industry within the Bangsamoro Region as part of its Halal Program and Development ²;

WHEREAS, the Halal Industry Development aims to turn the country into a supplier of Halal products, which are items that comply with the provisions of the Islamic or Shariah law³;

WHEREAS, in the People’s Budget - Bangsamoro Halal Ecosystem Program, the Development Advisory Group Philippines reports that the Halal market is still a fledgling endeavor. It has not fully evolved into an industry but a small niche with very few players and a very large unserved market⁴;

WHEREAS, the Department of Science and Technology Food Sector Halal Roadmap (2022-2028) demonstrates that currently, the importance of the Halal industry is not widely understood both locally and globally⁵;

WHEREAS, a significant number of Muslims are still not aware of the importance of complying with the Islamic laws in producing and consuming goods and services⁶;

WHEREAS, the integration of the Halal food industry development to regular programs and projects could make Halal food more widely available and accessible to Muslims in the region;

WHEREAS, the conduct of the Halal food industry development activities can also further foster harmony and greater appreciation and understanding of the Muslim culture.

WHEREAS, there are efforts towards the institutionalization of Halal Food Industry Development, but we have yet to see the outcome of these initiatives; and

WHEREAS, this industry remains to be promising, popular in paper yet its contribution to economic development of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region remains to be seen.

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the BTA Parliament, to pass and approve this Resolution encouraging the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Agrarian Reform (MAFAR), Ministry of Trade, Investments, and Tourism (MTIT), and Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) to strengthen the institutionalization in their regular programs and projects the Halal food industry development.

Adopted,
