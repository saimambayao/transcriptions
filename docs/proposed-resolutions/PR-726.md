**A RESOLUTION ENCOURAGING THE MAINSTREAMING OF RENEWABLE ENERGY, SPECIFICALLY SOLAR ENERGY, IN INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IMPLEMENTED BY BANGSAMORO MINISTRIES, OFFICES, AND AGENCIES (BMOAs)**

**WHEREAS, Section 2, Article IV** of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) states that in the exercise of its right to self-governance, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is free to pursue its political, economic, social, and cultural development as provided for in this Organic Law;

**WHEREAS, Section 3, Article V** of the BOL provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the powers expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, the promotion of health and safety, the enhancement of the right of the people to a balanced ecology, the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, the improvement of public morals, the enhancement of economic prosperity and social justice, the promotion of full employment among its residents, the maintenance of peace and order, and the preservation of the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants;

**WHEREAS, Section 2, Article VII** of the BOL states that the powers of government shall be vested in the Parliament, which shall exercise those powers and functions expressly granted to it in this Organic Law, as well as those necessary for, or incidental to, the proper governance and development of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. It shall set policies, legislate on matters within its authority, and elect a Chief Minister who shall exercise executive authority on its behalf;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Organic Law affirms the Bangsamoro Government’s commitment to sustainable development, environmental protection, and inclusive progress for the people of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM);

**WHEREAS**, several Bangsamoro Ministries, Offices, and Agencies (BMOAs) have been implementing infrastructure projects in BARMM, but only a few of these projects utilize solar energy;

**WHEREAS**, solar-powered infrastructure, or a combination of solar and conventional energy sources, ensures cost-efficiency and sustainability;

**WHEREAS**, access to reliable and affordable energy remains a critical development challenge in many rural and remote areas of the region, hindering economic productivity, access to social services, and quality of life;

**WHEREAS**, renewable energy—particularly solar energy—offers a clean, sustainable, and cost-effective solution to addressing energy gaps in infrastructure development, especially in off-grid and underserved communities;

**WHEREAS**, solar energy has demonstrated viability in powering schools, multi-purpose halls, covered courts, training centers, day care centers, hospitals, rural health units, barangay health stations, public markets, public terminals, housing units, street lighting, ports, airports, water systems, government offices, and other public infrastructure;

**WHEREAS**, mainstreaming solar energy in public infrastructure projects aligns with global and national commitments to climate action, disaster resilience, and sustainable energy access, while also promoting energy independence and reducing long-term operating costs;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Government, through the BMOAs, plays a key role in shaping development investments and can lead by example in adopting renewable energy solutions;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved, to encourage the mainstreaming of renewable energy, specifically solar energy, in infrastructure development projects implemented by Bangsamoro Ministries, Offices, and Agencies;

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, that BMOAs are encouraged to incorporate solar energy components in the planning, budgeting, and implementation phases of public infrastructure projects, in coordination with relevant agencies and stakeholders;

**RESOLVED FINALLY**, that copies of this Resolution be furnished to the Office of the Chief Minister and other concerned BMOAs for their information and appropriate action.
