**RESOLUTION ENCOURAGING THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MINISTER, ALL MINISTRIES, AGENCIES, AND OFFICES, AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNITS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO TO REQUIRE THEIR EMPLOYEES TO ATTEND THE VALUES ORIENTATION WORKSHOP AND TO INSTITUTIONALIZE VOW AS A YEARLY EVENT FOR ALL EMPLOYEES, ESPECIALLY NEW HIRES**

**WHEREAS**, Section 1, Article XI of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides: “Public office is a public trust, requiring public officials and employees to serve with responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency, and tasks the Civil Service Commission to promote ethical standards and morale in the civil service”;

**WHEREAS**, Section 6, Article IV of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the “Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao” (BOL) states: “the Bangsamoro Government shall promote unity, peace, justice, and goodwill among all peoples, as well as encourage a just and peaceful settlement of disputes”;

**WHEREAS**, under the leadership of Honorable Chief Minister Abdulraof Macacua, the Bangsamoro government has reaffirmed moral governance as the fundamental guiding principle in governance,¹ emphasizing integrity, accountability, transparency, and inclusive public service² — core values that align closely with the principles promoted in VOW aimed at strengthening ethical standards and professionalism among BARMM public servants;

**WHEREAS**, the Values Orientation Workshop (VOW) is a continuing intervention program designed by the Civil Service Commission (CSC) to inculcate core public service values such as Pagkatao (Personhood), Pagka-Filipino (National Identity), Pagka-Kalikasan (Environmental Consciousness), and Pagka-Tagapaglingkod (Public Service and Professionalism), in accordance with Republic Act No. 6713, the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees;³

**WHEREAS**, VOW has been successfully conducted in some BARMM ministries, agencies, and offices (MAOs), demonstrating its relevance and significant impact in strengthening the ethical standards and character of civil servants in the region, as evidenced by the VOW session held by the Ministry of Social Services and Development (MSSD) in July 2025 with 63 participants from its regional and provincial offices,⁴ and the earlier VOW facilitated by the Civil Service Commission BARMM for the Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority (BPDA) in May 2019, which effectively integrated values orientation into their organizational capacity-building initiatives;⁵

**WHEREAS**, the research entitled “*Values Orientation Workshop (VOW) and its Contribution to the Work Motivation and Organizational Commitment of Government Hospital Personnel: The Iloilo Experience*” underscores the importance of VOW, revealing that participation in the program significantly enhances employees’ knowledge and integration of core public service values—particularly *Pagka-kalikasan* and *Pagka-tagapaglingkod*—while fostering work motivation, promoting positive behavioral changes, and reinforcing professionalism, thereby demonstrating its vital role in strengthening the ethical foundation and effectiveness of government personnel;⁶

**WHEREAS**, institutionalizing the VOW as a regular, preferably annual, program—especially for new hires—will ensure the sustained internalization of ethical standards, professionalism, and values-based leadership across all BARMM MAOs and LGUs, thereby fostering a culture of integrity, accountability, and moral governance that strengthens public trust and enhances the overall quality of public service delivery in the region;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved to:

1. Encourage the Office of the Chief Minister, all Ministries, Agencies, and Offices, and all Local Government Units in BARMM to require their employees to attend the Values Orientation Workshop as part of their professional and ethical development;

2. Urge all MAOs and LGUs to institutionalize the VOW as an annual event, prioritizing attendance by new hires to ensure early and consistent values formation;

3. Request the Civil Service Commission BARMM, in coordination with the Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority and other relevant bodies, to provide technical assistance, standardize the VOW curriculum, and monitor its implementation across BARMM;

4. Encourage MAOs and LGUs to integrate VOW outcomes into their human resource development plans to sustain moral governance and enhance public service quality;

5. Direct concerned agencies to document and evaluate the impact of VOW on employee conduct and organizational performance to inform future policy and training improvements.

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, that copies of this resolution be furnished to the Office of the Chief Minister, Civil Service Commission BARMM, Bangsamoro Development Agency, all Ministries, Agencies, Offices, and Local Government Units for their information and appropriate action.
