**WHEREAS**, in letter (p), Section 2, Article V of Republic Act No. 11054 otherwise known as Bangsamoro Organic Law it states that “xxx The Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, xxx.”

**WHEREAS**, mandated in Section 24, Article IX for the Bangsamoro Government to preserve the culture xxx of the Bangsamoro People xxx.

**WHEREAS**, Muslims believe in the afterlife and that once an individual’s soul is freed from the physical body, they await a reckoning where they can account for their actions in this life. As part of this belief, Muslim funerals and burials are usually held as soon as possible after death to free the soul from the body.

**WHEREAS**, the family of the dead expects the body of the deceased to be handled with the utmost respect and gentleness as possible, because the sanctity of the dead person is considered to be the same as for the living. Muslim culture has a specific way of handling the *mayat*, before the burial, it must undergo mandatory 3 steps – washing, shrouding, and prayer.

**WHEREAS**, when a Muslim dies, it is the responsibility of his/her family or other Muslims in the community to wash him/her according to the Islamic rites of washing the *mayat*. It shall be done in a secluded and private place where clean water and soap are available.

**WHEREAS**, an Imam or knowledgeable person may be present to advice and guide the family who will be washing the deceased’s body. Washing the deceased’s body is obligatory on Muslims; if some members take the responsibility of doing it the need is fulfilled, but if no one fulfills it, then all Muslims will be accountable.

**WHEREAS**, this Proposed Resolution aims in the preservation of the Islamic Culture by training interested Muslim individuals, particularly the young generation, and the Imams or Muslim religious persons of the traditional Muslim funeral ritual of Ghusl. (*Ghusl is an Arabic term to the full-body ritual purification mandatory before the performance of various rituals and prayers, for any adult Muslim after having ejaculation or complete of the menstrual cycle. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghusl*) To pass on to the next generation the proper procedure of handling the *mayat* in accordance with the religion or culture of the dead.

**WHEREAS**, this aims to also provide facilities such as but not limited to a building or infrastructure where the washing and shrouding of the MAYAT will be performed, water and soap, assigned *Asatidz* or *Imam* in the absence of a family member to perform, transport vehicle for the *mayat*, and other necessaries as may be required.

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Parliament – Bangsamoro Transition Authority of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao on **A RESOLUTION CALLING THE BANGSAMORO DARUL-IFTA’ TO FACILITATE THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THE PROPER HANDLING OF “MAYAT” PROVIDING NECESSARY FACILITIES, CAPACITY BUILDING OF THE ASATIDZ AND APPROPRIATIONG FUNDS THEREOF.**
