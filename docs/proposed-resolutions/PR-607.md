Ebrahim also declared a state of calamity in the Bangsamoro region after Typhoon Paeng caused massive flooding and landslides in some parts of the region—particularly in Cotabato City, Maguindanao del Norte, and Maguindanao del Sur—which displaced thousands of families and caused widespread damage to properties, infrastructure, power and telecommunications services, and casualties;

**WHEREAS**, on 2 November 2022, the Hon. President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. signed Proclamation No. 84 placing BARMM, Regions IV-A (Calabarzon), V (Bicol Region), and VI (Western Visayas) under the state of calamity for six months after the onslaught brought about by Severe Tropical Storm “Paeng;”

**WHEREAS**, the article "Harnessing the Power of Trees: Nature’s Flood Protectors" by the Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Office declares that as climate change intensifies flooding, communities globally are turning to trees as a natural and cost-effective flood mitigation strategy.
