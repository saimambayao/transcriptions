**WHEREAS**, as enshrined under Section 7, Article IV of RA 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law, “the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure every Filipino citizen in its territorial jurisdiction the provision of the basic necessities and equal opportunities in life.”

**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Chapter 1, Title VIII, of the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 13, provides that, “the Ministry of Interior and Local Government (MILG) is mandated to exercise general supervision over the constituent local government units of the Bangsamoro Government, and ensure public safety and disaster preparedness, local autonomy, decentralization, and community empowerment”.

Furthermore, under the same code, Section 32, Chapter 3(B), Title III, states that, “the Bangsamoro Information Office (BIO) is mandated to be the center of information through the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region’s communication platforms to promote transparency, moral governance, and to enrich the quality of public discourse.”

**WHEREAS**, our constituents have visited various offices within the Bangsamoro Government Region seeking assistance for a range of issues. Nonetheless, certain concerns cannot be addressed, as they fall beyond the scope of authority of those specific offices or agencies.

**WHEREAS**, the office of Member of the Parliament Dr. Susana Salvador-Anayatin has been conducting a monthly forum to present the programs and projects of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).
