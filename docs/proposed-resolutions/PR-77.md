WHEREAS pursuant to the foregoing premises, it is now imperative that the Rules of the Bangsamoro Parliament Governing Inquiries in Aid of Legislation must be adopted;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Parliament to adopt the RULES AND PROCEDURES GOVERNING BANGSAMORO PARLIAMENT INQUIRIES IN AID OF LEGISLATION by providing the following:

It need not be under oath but may be accompanied by supporting affidavits. Such petition or information shall be addressed to the Speaker, who shall refer the same to the appropriate Committee.

Nothing in this provision shall preclude the BTA Parliament from referring to any Committee or Committees any speech or resolution filed by any Member of BTA Parliament which in its judgment requires an appropriate inquiry in aid of legislation.

**SEC. 4. Petition by Non-Members.** - A petition filed or information given by any person not a Member of BTA Parliament shall be under oath, stating the facts upon which it is based, and shall be accompanied by supporting affidavits. If the Speaker finds the petition or information to be in accordance with the requirements of this Section, he shall refer the same to the appropriate Committee.

**SEC. 5. Jurisdictional Challenge.** - If the jurisdiction of the Committee is challenged on any ground, the said issue must first be resolved by the Committee before proceeding with the inquiry.

If the Committee, by a majority vote of its members present there being a quorum, decides that its inquiry is pertinent or relevant to the implementation or re-examination of any law or appropriation or in connection with any pending or proposed legislation or will aid in the review or formulation of a new legislative policy or enactment, or extends to any and all matters vested by the Constitution in the Bangsamoro Parliament, it shall overrule such objection and proceed with the investigation.

A decision to conduct an inquiry shall require the concurrence of a majority of the members present provided there is a quorum.
