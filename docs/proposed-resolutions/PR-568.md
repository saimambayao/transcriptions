**A RESOLUTION**
**REQUESTING ALL FOOD ESTABLISHMENTS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM) TO LABEL AND IDENTIFY IN A CONSPICUOUS PLACE AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE ESTABLISHMENT IF THEY ARE SERVING OR NOT SERVING PORK ND ITS BY-PRODUCTS**

**WHEREAS,** At the 2023 Halal in Travel Global Summit, the Philippines was recognized as an Emerging Muslim-friendly Destination;

**WHEREAS,** Republic Act No. 10611, also known as the “Food Safety Act of 2013”, provides regulations to ensure food safety, protect consumer health, and facilitate market access for local foods and food products in the Philippines;

**WHEREAS,** in the absence of a direct law requiring restaurants to label all pork dishes, the broader food safety regulations aim to protect consumers and promote fair practices in the food trade, RA No. 10611 does have broader objectives, *to wit*;

1. Protection from unsafe foods
2. Enhancing industry and consumer confidence
3. Economic growth and fair trade

**WHEREAS,** The Philippines is an emerging market for halal products due to its growing Muslim population and is positioning itself as a halal food processing hub for export to other countries and regions with significant Muslim populations;

**WHEREAS,** in Southeast Asia, the Philippines has the third largest Muslim population. Philippine Statistics Authority reported that approximately six (6%) percent of the population is Muslim, growing at a rate of three (3) percent annually;

**WHEREAS,** the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF) estimates the Muslim population is ten (10%) percent, equivalent to twelve (12) million people;

**WHEREAS,** the majority of Muslims in the Philippines reside in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to request all food establishments in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) to label and identify in a conspicuous place at the entrance of the establishment if they are serving or not serving pork and its by-products.

**RESOLVED FURTHER,** that a copy of this resolution be furnished to Ministry of Trade, Industry and Tourism (MTIT), National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF) and Darul-Ifta’.
