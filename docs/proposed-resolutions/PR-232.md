**RESOLUTION**

**DIRECTING THE MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT (MILG) IN COORDINATION WITH CONSTITUENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNITS TO CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE CENSUS AND ASSESSMENT REPORT ON THE COMPLIANCE BY THE BARANGAY OFFICIALS IN BARMM IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE KATARUNGANG PAMBARANGAY LAW (BARANGAY JUSTICE SYSTEM)**

**WHEREAS**, Section 6, Article IV of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) provides that:

> “*Promotion of Unity.* — The Bangsamoro Government shall promote unity, peace, justice, and goodwill among all peoples, as well as encourage a **just and peaceful settlement of disputes**”;

**WHEREAS**, Barangays are at the very frontline of provision of basic services and have become a strategic point to ensure that government programs are felt by the people, they being the first responders of governance and are within the reach of mostly all constituents¹;

**WHEREAS**, Katarungang Pambarangay or Barangay Justice System is a community-based mechanism for dispute settlement administered by the basic political unit of the country - the Barangay² whose ultimate goal is to improve access to justice through amicable settlement of family and community disputes;

**WHEREAS**, it provides for an alternative mode for dispute resolution to the costly and lengthy process of settling disputes in regular courts thereby negating the common view that justice works only for the rich;

**WHEREAS**, it maximizes the use of time-honored traditions and practices of communities in settling disputes between community members in recognition of traditional customary practices in some indigenous communities³;

**WHEREAS**, statistics reveal that the government is able to save approximately P10,000 for every case settled at the barangay level;

**WHEREAS**, factors which adversely affect the Barangay justice system’s effectiveness include unsatisfactory budget distribution, lack of technical capacity, lack of information and limited outreach, and weak reporting and supervision systems⁴;

**WHEREAS**, study shows that numerous barangays do not even constitute a Lupon⁵;

**WHEREAS**, with a working barangay justice system in place, many communities could end up more harmonious and peaceful;

**WHEREAS**, a comprehensive census and assessment report can serve as a baseline for developing new policies and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance by the incumbents with all the functions mandated by law;

**WHEREAS**, a report can show the realities taking place at the grassroots and can help in estimating changes which can be introduced through evidence-based legislation;

**WHEREAS**, based on the 2020 census of the Philippine Statistic Authority published on August 23, 2021, the total number of barangays in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao are 2,490;

**WHEREAS**, considering the number of constituents who will benefit in strengthening and enhancing the implementation of the *Katarungang Pambarangay*, there is a need for the policy-makers to be informed on the status of the barangay officials’ compliance with their mandate not only to monitor their progress but also to address gaps that hinder their effectiveness;

**WHEREAS**, Chapter VII, Title I, Book III of the proposed Bangsamoro Local Governance Code deals with *Katarungang Pambarangay* similar to the provisions on Barangay Justice System in Republic Act 7160, otherwise known as the 1991 Local Government Code which gave the Barangays the mandate to enforce peace and order and provide support for the effective enforcement of human rights and justice;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the BTA Parliament, for the Ministry of the Interior and Local Government (MILG) in coordination with constituent local government units to conduct a comprehensive census and assessment report on the compliance of all Barangay officials in BARMM in the implementation of the Barangay Justice System or the Katarungang Pambarangay Law;

**RESOLVED, FINALLY**, that a copy of this resolution be furnished to the Office of the Minister of Interior and Local Government.

**ADOPTED**,
