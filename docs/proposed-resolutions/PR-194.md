Two other Councils were also mandated to be established by the LGUs, namely:

**WHEREAS**, as mandated by the aforementioned Code, the functions and responsibilities of the Local Special Bodies are hereby summarized, as follows:

h) **Local Council for the Elderly** – the LCE shall formulate policies and adopt measures mutually beneficial to the elderly and to the community.

**WHEREAS**, the national legislation of the Local Government Code of 1991 beneficially includes the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, where some of its provisions are quoted and cited in the Bangsamoro Organic Law.

**WHEREAS**, after 30 years of implementation, there was no review and assessment of the effectiveness and relevance of the Local Special Bodies in local governance, especially in the autonomous regions;

**WHEREAS**, the proposed review and assessment of the Local Special Bodies is intended to determine the functionality of the local structure at all levels (municipal, city, and provincial);

**WHEREAS**, the result of the review and assessment shall also be used by the Parliament to formulate or revise the Bangsamoro Local Government Code;

**WHEREAS**, the result of the review and assessment could also potentially inform policy-makers at the national level towards revisiting the RA No. 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991;

**WHEREAS**, the Ministry of Interior and Local Government shall ensure that the results of the review are properly communicated to the Local Government Units in order to guide them in improving the functionality of their Local Special Bodies as mandated by the local government code;
