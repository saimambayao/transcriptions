MUHTAMAD, BASILAN PROVINCE**

**WHEREAS**, ARTICLE XIII, Section 38 of the *Bangsamoro Organic Law* provides that “The Bangsamoro Government shall have the authority to grant regional franchises, licenses, and permits to land, sea and air, and transportation plying routes in the provinces or cities within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region xxx.”;

**WHEREAS**, Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 13, also known as the *Bangsamoro Administrative Code*, under Title XV thereof, mandates the Ministry of Transportation and Communications to be the primary policy, planning, programming, coordinating, implementing, regulating, and administrative entity of the Bangsamoro Government in the promotion, development, and **regulation** of dependable and coordinated networks of transportation and communications systems, as well as fast, **safe**, efficient and reliable transportation and communications services.” (emphasis supplied);

**WHEREAS**, the same Code likewise provides under Section 25 thereof, that the MOTC, through its sectoral office the Bangsamoro Maritime Industry Authority (BMARINA), shall have the powers, among others, to: “issue Special Permit to all vessels operating within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region” as well as “conduct safety inspections of vessels operating within the jurisdiction of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region so as to determine compliance with Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and manning requirements”;

**WHEREAS**, “Safety of Life at Sea” refers to the measures undertaken to ensure the safety and well-being of people traveling on or working at sea. This includes everything from ensuring that vessels are seaworthy and properly equipped, to implementing measures to prevent accidents, to providing emergency response and rescue services, as set out in the International Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea (CSOLAS), ratified by the Philippines in 1979 and entered into force in 1980;

**WHEREAS**, the implementation of the CSOLAS in the Philippines is primarily undertaken by the national government through the Philippine Coast Guard, as an attached agency to the Department of Transportation and Communications under Republic Act No. 9993 or the “Philippine Coast Guard Law of 2009”;

**WHEREAS**, Section 3 of said law provides that “The PCG shall have the following powers and functions:
(a) To enforce regulations in accordance with all relevant maritime international conventions, treaties or instruments and national laws for the promotion of safety of life property at sea within the maritime jurisdiction of the Philippines and conduct port state control implementation;
(b) To inspections on all merchant ships and vessels, including but shall not be limited to inspections prior to departure, to ensure and enforce compliance with safety standards, rules and regulations;”;

**WHEREAS**, last March 29, 2023, at around 11:30 PM, *M/V Mary Joy 3*, a cargo and passenger vessel owned and operated by Aleson Shipping Lines and plying the route Zamboanga-Jolo, caught fire while sailing some kilometers off the coast of Hji. Muhtamad municipality, Basilan province, resulting in the death of 33 passengers (as per news update¹ dated April 13, 2023), various injuries and distress to survivors as well as missing persons as of April 13, 2023;

**WHEREAS**, the official Passenger Manifest only listed 205 persons whereas reports of the incident revealed that there were 240 people on board the vessel: 205 passengers and 35 crew members, with others are still missing;

**WHEREAS**, Bureau of Fire Prevention officers has identified electrical wiring as the cause of the fire, which according to the same officers, originated from the cabin section of the vessel;

**WHEREAS**, this representation has had the experience of being a passenger herself of the same vessel plying the Jolo-Zamboanga route, just 10 days before the incident, and has observed the insufficiency of safety precautions implemented by the shipping line;

**WHEREAS**, there is an urgent and critical need for the Bangsamoro Government to step up in its efforts to regulate the seafaring vessels that traverse the Bangsamoro waters, as well as its collaboration and coordination with the Philippine Coast Guard operations in the BARMM, so that the tragedy that befell M/V Mary Joy 3 and its passengers and crew members, will not be repeated;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED by the BTA Parliament, to pass this resolution urging the Ministry of Transportation and Communications to intensify the implementation and performance of its mandate, specifically under Section 25, paragraph (f) of the Bangsamoro Administrative Code, to “conduct safety inspections of vessels operating within the jurisdiction of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region so as to determine compliance with Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and manning requirements”;

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED**, that the Ministry foster closer collaboration and cooperation with the Philippine Coast Guard through the latter’s BARMM District Office, to ensure maritime safety and security in the Bangsamoro waters, especially as it relates to passenger vessels with routes in the BARMM;

**BE IT FINALLY BE RESOLVED**, that the Statutory Committee on Transportation and Communications be provided a report detailing the measures undertaken by the Ministry in furtherance of this Resolution 60 days from adoption hereof.
