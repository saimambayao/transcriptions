**WHEREAS,** according to the statement of Police Chief Major Jenahmeel Toñacao of Lambayong, the three Bangsamoro youths were riding a motorcycle when they were stopped for an inspection in Purok 4, Barangay Didtaras by the policemen manning the checkpoint, however the youths allegedly sped away, prompting the police to give chase. The youths allegedly fired at the policemen who cornered them in a 'brief chase', thus provoking the police to return gunfire shots. Two 45-caliber pistols, a hand grenade, and a sachet of shabu from the fatalities were allegedly recovered;
