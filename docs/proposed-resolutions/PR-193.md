Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants;

**WHEREAS**, Section 8 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 10176 or the Arbor Day Act of 2012 states that all able-bodied citizen of the Philippines, who are at least twelve (12) years of age, shall be required to plant one (1) tree every year;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Government has a pivotal role in protecting the environment within the region through the implementation of effective environmental policies;

**WHEREAS**, tree planting activities have extensive environmental benefits. It helps fight climate change, prevents natural calamities, give more oxygen in our air, and thus making the air we breathe clean. Limited number of trees in the region may result to breathing harmful pollutants;

**WHEREAS**, trees (together with plants) use sunlight energy to do photosynthesis - a process that uses carbon dioxide and water to create energy (glucose) for their cells¹. When trees breathe they take in carbon dioxide, release oxygen and store carbon in their trunks. When trees are cut down, much of the stored carbon is released into the atmosphere again as CO₂.² The CO₂ in the atmosphere warms the planet, thus, the increase of CO₂ in the Earth's atmosphere contributes to global warming and climate change;

**WHEREAS**, according to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), a single tree can sequester 0.56 metric tons of carbon dioxide in its lifetime, and around 10 trees are needed to capture the emissions of just one car³;

**WHEREAS**, the recent calamities, especially typhoons, massive flooding and landslides have brought so much destruction and caused the lives of our people. Tree-planting consciousness needs to be reinforced annually in order to continuously give an awareness to the Bangsamoro people the importance of protecting and sustaining the environment for the future generations;

**WHEREAS**, the reforestation activity is one of the environmental interventions to minimize the effects of natural calamities and reduce climate change according to the Director of Forest Management Services Forester Abdul-Jalil Umngan. He further explained that, "the impact of climate change knocks on our doors already and there is no quick solution to lessen the floods aside from reforestation. That is why, we encourage people to support environmental advocacies for the current and future generations,"⁴;

**WHEREAS**, fewer trees in the region may result to frequent flooding, soil erosion, landslides and pollution. As a means of prevention, it is imperative for the Bangsamoro Government to create sustainable solutions in addressing these worsening effects caused by cutting down trees;

**WHEREAS**, Earth Day was first celebrated on April 22, 1970 in the United States of America. Now, it is observed in more than 175 countries annually. It is an annual celebration that honors the achievements of the environmental movement and raises awareness of the need to protect Earth's natural resources for future generations⁵;

**WHEREAS**, institutionalizing annual tree planting during the Earth day is one way of mobilizing massive voluntary action in bringing awareness and appreciation to the environment by protecting the Earth;

**WHEREAS**, that in the conduct of the Annual Tree/Propagules Planting, the 4th to 6th class municipalities are required to plant trees in at least five thousand square meters (5,000 sqm.) of land while the 1st to 3rd class municipalities shall be required at least three thousand square meters (3,000 sqm.) of land;

**WHEREAS**, for municipalities within the coastal areas and island provinces, it is encouraged to plant propagules in order to help protect the region's marine resources;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the BTA Parliament, to pass and approve this Resolution urging the Ministry of Local Government (MILG) and the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources and Energy (MENRE) and to conduct an annual simultaneous tree/propagules planting during Earth Day to their respective areas.

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, that copy of this Resolution be furnished to the MILG and MENRE for appropriate action.
