**RESOLUTION**

**CALLING ON THE MINISTRY OF BASIC, HIGHER, AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION TO REVIEW AND READJUST THE MAINTENANCE AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES (MOOE) OF THE DIVISION OFFICES, DISTRICT OFFICES, AND SCHOOLS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION AND TO REGULARLY AND TIMELY DOWNLOAD OR RELEASE THE SAME, WITH THE END VIEW OF DEVELOPING ENHANCED GUIDELINES FOR THE UTILIZATION THEREOF**

**WHEREAS,** Section 17, Article II of the 1987 Constitution requires the State to give priority to education;

**WHEREAS,** in furtherance thereof, Section 5 (5) of Article XIV further mandates “the State to assign the highest budget priority to education”;

**WHEREAS,** in order, among others, “to enable the schools and learning centers to reflect the values of the community by allowing teachers/learning facilitators and other staff to have the flexibility to serve the needs of all learners” and “to encourage local initiatives for the improvement of schools and learning centers and to provide the means by which these improvements may be achieved and sustained,” Republic Act 9155, otherwise known as the “Governance of Basic Education Act of 2001” provides that:

> “the Secretary of the Department of Education shall ensure that resources appropriated for the field offices are adequate and that resources for school personnel, school desks and textbooks, and other instructional materials intended are allocated directly and released immediately by the Department of Budget and Management to said offices.”

**WHEREAS,** pursuant thereto, the Department of Budget and Management and the Department of Education issued Joint Circular No. 2004-1 dated January 01, 2004, entitled Guidelines on the Direct Release of Funds to DepEd-Regional Offices and Implementing Units;

**WHEREAS,** RA 9155 specifically provides that the powers and functions of the Regional director of the Department of Education in the ARMM are to be performed by the Regional Education Secretary for the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao:

> “Sec. 13. Governance in the ARMM. - The Regional Education Secretary for the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) shall exercise similar governance authority over the divisions, districts, schools, and learning centers in the region as may be provided in the Organic Act without prejudice to the provisions of Republic Act No. 9054, entitled “An Act to Strengthen and Expand the Organic Act for the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, Amending for the Purpose Republic Act No. 6734, entitled ‘An Act Providing for the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, as amended.’”

**WHEREAS,** the First Organic Act (RA 6734) of the ARMM also authorized the then ARMM to “establish, maintain and support a complete and integrated system of quality education” and “to develop curricula that are relevant to the economic, social, political, cultural, moral and spiritual needs of the people in the region,” our educational system still remains a sub-system of the national education system and mimic the national education programs”;

**WHEREAS,** similarly, under the BOL, our educational system in the BARMM remains a sub-system of the national as specifically stated in Section 16, Article IX of the BOL, thus:

> “**Section 16.** It shall be a top priority of the Bangsamoro Government to establish, maintain, and support a complete and integrated system of quality education, which shall be a subsystem of the national education system. The Bangsamoro Government shall develop an educational framework relevant and responsive to the needs, ideals, and aspirations of the Bangsamoro people. For this purpose, the Bangsamoro Government shall conform to the minimum standards set by the National Government.”

**WHEREAS,** in order for the MBHTE to fully fulfill its duties and for them to accomplish these objectives, its field offices shall be allocated and provided with adequate resources, in terms of personnel, books, furniture, and other instructional or learning materials, and sufficient funding support;

**WHEREAS,** the Division Office in Sulu, the District Offices, and the different elementary schools in the province have been raising concerns about the lack of resources, personnel, instructional materials, school furniture, other educational resources, and funding support;

**WHEREAS,** the above-mentioned Division offices and District offices find the MOOE that the MBHTE has been allocating to them to be insufficient and that almost all the elementary schools do not have their own MOOE and that is further compounded by the frequent delay of its release or downloading of their funds;

**WHEREAS,** under the aforementioned RA 9155, Division Officers, District Officers, and school heads are tasked with duties and functions not only of implementing the prescribed curricula but also monitoring of schools, continued staff development, and management and administration of personnel;

**WHEREAS,** the Bangsamoro Education Code also empowers the Division Offices as follows:

> “**Section 22. Functions.** - The Division Offices shall:
> 
> a. Formulate and implement the Division Plan;
> b. Implement laws, rules and regulations, policies, plans, programs, and projects of the Ministry;
> c. Coordinate with local government units, civil society, and non-government organizations; and
> d. Perform other functions as may be provided by law or by the Minister.

**WHEREAS,** the effective performance of these functions requires adequate funding support, which at present is inadequate or totally unavailable;

**WHEREAS,** due to the insufficiency, inadequacy, or unavailability of their MOOE, some programs intended to improve educational outcomes can no longer be fully implemented to the prejudice of the learners;

**THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED** by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament to strongly recommend to the MBHTE to review and readjust the Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) of the division offices, district offices, and schools in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, to regularly and timely download or release the same, with the end view of developing guidelines for the utilization thereof.

**RESOLVED FURTHER** that copies of this resolution be furnished to the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education and other concerned Ministries and Offices for information and appropriate consideration.
