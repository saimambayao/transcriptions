**“A RESOLUTION IN AID OF LEGISLATION URGING A REVIEW AND ENHANCEMENT OF SECURITY MEASURES IN INDIGENOUS PEOPLES’ COMMUNITIES IN MAGUINDANAO DEL SUR”**

**WHEREAS**, on July 25, 2025, an ambush occurred in the hinterlands of South Upi, Maguindanao del Sur, resulting in the death of a Teduray farmer, **Nicasio Mindo**, who was on his way to fetch his wife, a public-school teacher attending a faculty meeting at Timanan Central Elementary School. Mindo was also transporting several students on his vehicle back to Sitio Samurai, Barangay Pilar, South Upi;

**WHEREAS**, on the same date, **John Mark Kanakan**, a 34-year-old Teduray farmer, was fatally shot while riding his motorcycle in another area of South Upi. Eyewitnesses reported that he was shot three times by unidentified assailants;

**WHEREAS**, these incidents are part of a disturbing pattern of violence targeting Non-Moro Indigenous Peoples (NMIP), with this latest case reportedly being the **89th recorded killing** of NMIP individuals within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM);

**WHEREAS**, these violent attacks continue to exacerbate fear, insecurity, and displacement among the Indigenous communities, threatening their lives, livelihoods, and cultural survival;

**WHEREAS**, there is a growing perception of inadequate government response and limited visibility of law enforcement and security forces in conflict-vulnerable ancestral domains, particularly in far-flung Indigenous barangays and sitios;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Government, together with national security and law enforcement agencies, has the obligation to uphold the right to life, safety, and security of all constituents, including the Non-Moro Indigenous Peoples as recognized under the Philippine Constitution, the Indigenous Peoples’ Rights Act (IPRA), Bangsamoro Indigenous Peoples Act of 2024 and the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL);

**NOW THEREFORE**, on behalf of the Non-Moro Indigenous Peoples in Maguindanao del Sur, **be it resolved, as it is hereby resolved**, to:

**1.** Urge the **Ministry of Public Order and Safety (MPOS)** and the **Ministry of Interior and Local Government (MILG)** to conduct a joint assessment of the current peace and security situation in Indigenous communities of South Upi and adjacent areas;
**2.** Call on the **Philippine National Police (PNP)** and the **Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP)**, in coordination with the LGU of South Upi and the IP Mandatory Representatives, to deploy additional personnel and ensure sustained presence in conflict-prone areas, with special attention to cultural sensitivity and human rights;
**3.** Request the **Bangsamoro Human Rights Commission (BHRC)** to investigate the series of killings and alleged violations of the right to life and security of Non-Moro Indigenous Peoples in the area;
**4.** Enjoin the **creation of a localized inter-agency task force**, including representatives from the IP community, civil society, and local security sectors, to monitor, respond, and recommend proactive measures to prevent further attacks;
**5.** Recommend the **provision of immediate support and protection to the affected families**, including psychosocial services, legal assistance, and livelihood restoration;
**6.** Encourage the **Parliament to consider legislation or budget support** that institutionalizes community-based Indigenous peacekeeping mechanisms, such as indigenous watches (diyaga fenuwo or bantay-katutubo), in partnership with state security forces;

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, that copies of this resolution be furnished to the Office of the Chief Minister, Ministry of Public Order and Safety, Ministry of Interior and Local Government, Philippine National Police-BAR, Bangsamoro Human Rights Commission, and the Local Government Unit of South Upi and Datu Abdullah Sangki for their appropriate action.
