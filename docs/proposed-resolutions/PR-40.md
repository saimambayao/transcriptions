**A RESOLUTION CALLING ON THE MINISTRY OF TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATION (MOTC) TO ESTABLISH A FAST CRAFT SEA ROUTE FROM ZAMBOANGA CITY TO POLLOC PORT, PARANG, MAGUINDANAO**

**WHEREAS,** Section 38, Article XIII of the Bangsamoro Organic Law provides that "*The Bangsamoro Government shall have the authority to grant the regional franchise, licenses, and permits to land, sea, and air, and transportation plying routes in the provinces or cities within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region:* Provided that the national government shall regulate the airside operation of all existing airports";

**WHEREAS,** the seaport of Zamboanga is located in Zamboanga City, Philippines, managed by the Philippine Ports Authority, Port Management Office-Zamboanga, (PPA, PMO-Zamboanga), otherwise known by its corporate name, Zamboanga Freeport Authority (ZFA);

**WHEREAS,** Polloc Free Port is located in Parang, Maguindanao, and was constructed in 1977, funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and started its operation in March 1980;

**WHEREAS,** the driving distance from Zamboanga City to Maguindanao and vice versa is approximately 429.1 km. The total time spent driving by land is about nine (9) to ten (10) hours;

**WHEREAS,** in fast craft sea routes, as the vessel is capable of maximum speed (where "maximum speed" means the rate achieved at the maximum continuous rating of the vessel's propulsion machinery), the time for travel is approximately four (4) hours.

**WHEREAS,** in the past, Polloc was a viable port when the roads in the region were still in terrible condition. Sulpicio Lines and Aboitiz Shipping made sea transportation available and had dedicated passenger-cargo ships and container ships to Polloc port. Sulpicio Lines used the Doña Marilyn (the former Doña Ana), an efficient cruiser liner. They then fielded the RORO liner Cotabato Princess when it arrived and served the route well;

**WHEREAS,** From the early 90s to 2010, sea transportation was available for Cotabato to Manila routes and vice versa, passing through Zamboanga Port to transport passengers and other business purposes to Manila, but it was then suspended;

**WHEREAS,** establishing a direct route from Zamboanga port to Cotabato port and vice versa will improve accessibility between the two provinces, boosting the economy through the business trade of said provinces;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT HEREBY RESOLVED,** by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority:

**TO PASS AND APPROVE THIS RESOLUTION CALLING THE MINISTRY OF TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATION (MOTC) TO ESTABLISH A FAST CRAFT SEA ROUTE FROM ZAMBOANGA CITY TO POLLOC PORT, PARANG, MAGUINDANAO.**
