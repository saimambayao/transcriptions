     1. The importance of inclusive and participatory legislative processes to ensure that the diverse needs and concerns of women from different regions and sectors are adequately represented;

     4. Strategies for engaging civil society and the public in the legislative process to enhance transparency, accountability, and inclusivity;

     5. Continuous sharing of information and expertise between the committees;

     6. Entering into a "sisterhood agreement" between the committees;

     7. And the visitation in BARMM of CWGE, headed by its Chairperson Hon. Roman, to reciprocate the efforts of CWYCP;
