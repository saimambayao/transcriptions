**RESOLUTION**

**URGING THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH (MOH) TO ESTABLISH A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS HOTLINE IN THE BANGSAMORO REGION**

WHEREAS, Section 15, Article II of the 1987 Constitution guarantees the protection and promotion of “*the right to health of the people*” and mandates the State to “*instill health consciousness among them*”;

WHEREAS, in symmetry therewith, Section 22, Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), provides that “*[t]he Bangsamoro Government shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. It shall also uphold the peoples’ right to have access to essential goods, health, and other social services that promote their well-being*”;

WHEREAS, Section 2 of Republic Act No. 11036, otherwise known as the “Mental Health Act,” reaffirms the State’s recognition of “*the basic right of all Filipinos to mental health as well as the fundamental rights of people who require mental health services*”;

WHEREAS, among the objectives of the Mental Health Act is to “*develop and establish a comprehensive, integrated effective and efficient national mental health care system responsive to the psychiatric, neurologic, and psychosocial needs of the Filipino people; strengthen information systems, evidence and research for mental health; and to promote mental health in educational institutions, the workplace, and in communities*”;

WHEREAS, according to the research conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO)-Philippines Special Initiative for Mental Health in the early part of 2020, at least 3.6 million Filipinos suffer from one kind of mental, neurological, and substance use disorder;

WHEREAS, studies of the WHO show that recurring armed conflicts in conflicted areas have negative impacts on the mental well-being of individuals, especially those who were displaced, which might lead to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD);

WHEREAS, the International Committee of the Red Cross, after observing some of the victims of the Marawi Siege, published an article on its official website on June 2021, stating that “*people affected by conflict suffer from invisible wounds that hinder their ability to recover from trauma*” and concluded that “*mental health must not be an afterthought in armed conflicts and emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic*”;

WHEREAS, based on the reports made by the Department of Health (DOH), six months after being infected with the virus, one out of every three Covid-19 patients developed neuropsychiatric disorders;

WHEREAS, this is exacerbated by exposure to digital media, the irresponsible or excessive use of which can bring about depression, anxiety, loneliness, self-harm, and even suicidal thoughts, as social media may promote negative experiences such as inadequacy about one’s life or appearance;

WHEREAS, a United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) study found that 10.9 percent of ARMM participants reported suicidal thoughts in the Bangsamoro region;

WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 42 of the Mental Health Act, there is created in the DOH “*a Mental Health Division, staffed by qualified mental health specialists and supported with an adequate yearly budget,*” “*that shall implement the National Mental Health Program*”;

WHEREAS, Section 21 of the Mental Health Act requires the setting-up or strengthening of a “*twenty-four seven (24/7) hotlines, to provide assistance to individuals with mental health conditions, especially individuals at risk of committing suicide, xxx*”;

WHEREAS, the DOH has already implemented the provision of this law by establishing a Mental Health Crisis Hotline under the tagline: “*Kumusta ka? Tara, usap tayo*”;

WHEREAS, although this Crisis Hotline can also cater to residents of the Bangsamoro, the total devolution of powers over health services to the Region and the language or cultural barriers may hinder our residents from seeking assistance from the National Helpline, thus necessitating the setting up of our own Regional Mental Health Crisis Helpline;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved, by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to **URGE THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH (MOH) TO ESTABLISH A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS HOTLINE IN THE BANGSAMORO REGION**;

**RESOLVED, FINALLY**, that copies of this resolution be furnished to the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education and the Ministry of Health for information and appropriate consideration.

**ADOPTED,**
