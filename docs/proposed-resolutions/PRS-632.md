**A RESOLUTION URGING THE COMELEC TO RESCHEDULE THE PERIOD OF TIME TO FILE CERTIFICATES OF CANDIDACY FOR PARLIAMENT DISTRICT REPRESENTATIVES AND THE ELECTIONS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION OF MUSLIM MINDANAO TO ALLOW AMPLE TIME TO AMEND THE REGIONAL LAW CREATING PARLIAMENTARY DISTRICTS AND APPORTION THE SEVEN DISTRICT REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE PROVINCE OF SULU TO THE REMAINING TERRITORIES OF THE BARMM**

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) was established following the passage of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), which aimed to provide for a more inclusive governance structure and grant greater autonomy to the Bangsamoro people;

WHEREAS, significant efforts have been made towards the establishment of a parliamentary form of government in the BARMM with the purpose of fostering peace, stability, and development in the region;

WHEREAS, these efforts are embodied under the Bangsamoro Organic Law or Republic Act 11054;

WHEREAS, an indispensable element of the Bangsamoro Organic Law is the provision on parliament representation which are embodied under Section 6 of Article VII of the Bangsamoro Organic Law which specifically provides 80 Parliament Members divided into 32 District Representatives, 40 Party List Representatives and 8 Sectoral Representatives;

WHEREAS, the Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines recognizes the right of the Bangsamoro people to self-determination, and the creation of BARMM has been a landmark step in honoring this right while addressing historical injustices faced by the Bangsamoro communities;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 58 (BAA No. 58) delineates the representation of various districts within the BARMM Parliament to ensure that the diverse voices in the region are adequately represented;

WHEREAS, the recent Supreme Court ruling in the case of Province of Sulu v. Executive Secretary et al.; PHILCONSA v. Senate et al.; and Dimaporo v. COMELEC (G.R. Nos. 242255, 243246, and 243693) confirmed that the Province of Sulu does not fall within the territorial jurisdiction of BARMM, following its rejection of the BOL during the ratification process;

WHEREAS, as a consequence of the Supreme Court's ruling, the representation originally allotted to the Province of Sulu—which comprised seven district representatives—has been rendered ineffective and raises pertinent questions about the appropriate apportionment of district representatives within the BARMM parliamentary framework;

WHEREAS, neglecting to address the fallout of the Supreme Court's decision could lead to the violation of the Bangsamoro Organic Law and the disenfranchisement of stakeholders who seek equitable representation in the BARMM Parliament. Constituents of the Bangsamoro region deserve a legislative assembly that accurately reflects their territories and populations;

WHEREAS, there exists a pressing need to amend BAA No. 58 to clarify the reallocation of district representative roles that were previously apportioned to the Province of Sulu, ensuring that the remaining provinces and cities within BARMM are properly represented based on updated demography and territorial integrity;

WHEREAS, COMELEC Resolution no. 11045 promulgated on August 28, 2024 provides under section 37 that the period of filing of certificates of candidacy including that of Parliament District Representatives is on October 1, 2024 to October 8, 2024;

WHEREAS, this period of time is too short for the amendment of BAA no. 58 and will effectively deprive the election of 7 district representatives which composes 22% or almost 1/4 of the total parliament district representative.

WHEREAS, the conduct of the BARMM Parliamentary Elections, originally scheduled for the 2025 National and Local Election, needs to be postponed until such crucial amendments to the BAA and the reapportionment of parliamentary seats are effectively made;

WHEREAS, timely and equitable representation is critical not only for fulfilling the democratic principles enshrined in the Constitution but also for fostering public trust in the newly established regional governance system;

WHEREAS, effective and fair electoral processes are foundational for sustainable governance, and any oversight in this regard could result in a crisis of legitimacy for the BARMM government and its parliamentary members;

WHEREAS, it is the obligation of the Commission on Elections to facilitate a transparent and lawful process to ensure that provisions of the law pertaining to elections are complied with, more specifically the law on representation and composition of the Bangsamoro Parliament.

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED,** that the Bangsamoro Parliament requests that the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) reschedule the period of filing the certificate of candidacy for district representatives and the conduct of the BARMM Parliamentary Elections, allowing time for necessary amendments to BAA No. 58 and ensuring adequate representation for all constituents within the BARMM.

**BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED,** that copies of this resolution be furnished to the His Excellency Ferdinand “Bongbong” Romualdez Marcos Jr. the President of the Philippines, the House of Representatives and the Senate of the Philippines to serve as an expression of the collective will of the people's representatives in the pursuit of a just and lasting peace for the Bangsamoro people.
