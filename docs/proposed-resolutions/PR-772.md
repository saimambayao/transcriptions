**A RESOLUTION RESPECTFULLY URGING THE SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE OR RESOLVE ALL PENDING CASES IN RELATION TO THE HOLDING OF THE FIRST BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS BEFORE THE DATE OF THE ELECTIONS SET BY THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS ON MARCH 30, 2026**

**WHEREAS**, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) set the date of elections for the first Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) Parliamentary Elections on March 30, 2025 in its Resolution No. 11181 dated November 19, 2025 supposedly in compliance with the Supreme Court Decision in the case of “Lanang T. Ali, Jr., Samsodin C. Amella, and Datuan . Magon, Jr. Vs. Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, Abdulraof A. Macacua, in his capacity as the Interim Chief Minister of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, and Commission on Elections/Abdullah G. Macapaar, also known as "Commander Bravo," Mangontawar M. Macacuna, Sultan Alim Saan I. Amate, Najer D. Eppie, Nasif G. Marangit, and Maulana L. Mamutuk Vs. Commission on Elections and Bangsamoro Transition Authority,” G.R. No. E02219/G.R. No. E-02235, September 30, 2025;

**WHEREAS**, the Supreme Court in its Decision stated that the Bangsamoro Transition Authority shall pass a new Districting law after declaring as unconstitutional the previous Districting laws passed by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, and “THEREAFTER, and in compliance with Section 5 of the Voter’s Registration Act, respondent Commission on Elections is DIRECTED to PROMPTLY PROCEED with its preparations and conduct elections not later than March 31, 2026.”;

**WHEREAS**, to date the Bangsamoro Transition Authority has yet to pass a new Districting law and it proposed to finish the new Districting law by the end of the year but the Comelec already issued a Calendar of Activities including the filing of certificates of candidacy on January 5-9, 2026 for the conduct of elections on March 30, 2026;

**WHEREAS**, Comelec Chairman Atty. George Garcia previously stated on September 20, 2025 that “*Ang Comelec ay walang kapangyarihan mag-fix ng date ng election. Only Congress can fix the date of the elections. Kung ma-reset as a consequence ng TRO at pag-suspend namin in compliance sa TRO, wala kaming mao-offer na sagot kung kailan yung halalan kung sakali.*” (Comelec says it has no power to reset BARMM polls, GMA Regional TV News, September 20, 2025);

**WHEREAS**, the Supreme Court Decision recognized the legislative authority and original jurisdiction of Congress to reschedule the BARMM Parliamentary Elections, wherein it stated that, “With utmost respect, we urge the Members of Congress to exercise their legislative authority and promptly enact a law that would reschedule the BARMM Parliamentary Elections. It is apparent that the current circumstances present significant challenges to the conduct of free, orderly, honest, peaceful, and credible elections in the most immediate time, as envisioned by the Constitution and the Bangsamoro Organic Law. A priority legislative measure adjusting the election date would ensure ample preparation by all stakeholders, safeguard the integrity of the electoral process, and uphold the Bangsamoro people’s right to meaningful participation.”;
