**WHEREAS,** Section 10 of The Local Government Code of 1991 (RA7160) and Section 10 of the Bangsamoro Local Governance Code of 2023 (BAA 49), provide for similar provision which states that:

> “xxx No creation, xxx of local government units shall take effect unless approved by a majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite called for the purpose in the political unit or units directly affected.”

**WHEREAS,** Article VI, Section 10 of the Bangsamoro Organic Law or the RA 11054 provides that:

> “xxx The parliament may create, xxx municipalities xxx in accordance with a law enacted by the Parliament. xxx Provided, that it shall be approved by a majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite in the political units directly affected. xxx”

**WHEREAS,** on April 13, 2024, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) successfully administered the plebiscite for the creation of eight (8) new Municipalities in the Special Geographic Area (SGA) of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).

**WHEREAS,** SGA is the territory of BARMM distributed in eight (8) municipalities in Cotabato Province, created through the plebiscite in 2019, carving out 63 barangays from the municipalities of Aleosan, Carmen, Kabacan, Midsayap, Pigcawayan, and Pikit,

**WHEREAS,** a plebiscite is a substantial and indispensable requirement of the law to ratify the creation of new municipalities in the BARMM.

**WHEREAS,** the COMELEC said that the result of the plebiscite showed 72,658 out of the total 89,954 eligible voters, or 81.10 percent, cast their votes during the plebiscite day with the scheduled voting hours from 7:00 am to 3:00 pm.

**WHEREAS,** the COMELEC further specified that 72,358 residents voted “yes” in favor of the ratification of the creation of eight (8) municipalities while only 273 voted “no”.

**WHEREAS,** the newly created municipalities consist of Pahamuddin having 12 Barangays, Tugunan with nine (9) Barangays, and seven (7) barangays each for Kadayangan, Nabalawag, Old Kaabakan, Kapalawan, Malidegao, and Ligawasan.

**WHEREAS,** COMELEC’s spokesperson Atty. John Rex C. Laudingco commended the peaceful and orderly conduct of the plebiscites, he said that “the peaceful and orderly conduct of the plebiscites would not have been successful without the invaluable partner agencies, namely the PNP, and AFP, with the full support of the LGUs of the concerned municipalities”.

**WHEREAS,** OPAPRU Secretary Carlito G. Galvez, Jr., said “We are delighted to see such a high level of participation from our constituents in the SGA. This is a testament of the people’s aspiration for their barangays to be part of BARMM. This plebiscite is also a very good preparation for the first regular BARMM regional elections to be held in 2025”.

**WHEREAS,** this resolution intends to recognize and applaud the orderly, peaceful, and meaningful conduct of the plebiscites in the Special Geographic Area of BARMM, through the joint efforts and hard work of the COMELEC, Security Sector, Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education (MBHTE), and Provincial Government of Cotabato.

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Parliament of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to **CONGRATULATE AND COMMEND THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS (COMELEC), SECURITY SECTOR, MINISTRY OF BASIC, HIGHER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION (MBHTE), AND PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT OF COTABATO FOR THE ORDERLY, PEACEFUL, AND MEANINGFUL CONDUCT OF PLEBISCITE IN THE SIXTY-THREE (63) BARANGAYS IN SPECIAL GEOGRAPHIC AREA (SGA) TO RATIFY THE CREATION OF EIGHT (8) NEW MUNICIPALITIES IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM).**
