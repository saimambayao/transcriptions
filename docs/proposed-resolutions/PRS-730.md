**A RESOLUTION URGING THE APPROPRIATE COMMITTEE TO CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE LEGAL AUDIT OF ALL REGIONAL LAWS ENACTED BY THE REGIONAL LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY (RLA) OF THE FORMER AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (ARMM), WITH THE END IN VIEW OF DETERMINING THEIR CONTINUED RELEVANCE, NECESSITY FOR AMENDMENT OR REPEAL, AND CONSISTENCY WITH THE BANGSAMORO ORGANIC LAW AND CURRENT POLICY PRIORITIES OF THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT**

**WHEREAS**, Section 4, Article XVI of Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), provides for the transition from the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) to the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), including the transfer of powers and functions, assets, liabilities, and applicable laws;

**WHEREAS**, the Regional Legislative Assembly (RLA) of the ARMM had enacted a body of regional laws intended to address the unique needs and circumstances of the former autonomous region;

**WHEREAS**, Section 6, Article XVI of the Bangsamoro Organic Law provides that all laws enacted by the ARMM Regional Legislative Assembly shall remain valid unless amended or repealed by the Bangsamoro Parliament, thus making it necessary to evaluate the continued enforceability and relevance of these laws under the BARMM framework;

**WHEREAS**, it is imperative to determine which of these inherited regional laws remain relevant and consistent with the principles and framework of the Bangsamoro Organic Law and the policy direction of the Bangsamoro Government;

**WHEREAS**, a comprehensive legal audit of all RLA-enacted regional laws will assist the Bangsamoro Parliament in identifying obsolete, inconsistent, or duplicative statutes, and in formulating appropriate legislative responses that are reflective of the needs of the Bangsamoro people under a parliamentary system;

**WHEREAS**, such audit will promote legislative clarity, transparency, and legal coherence within the Bangsamoro legal framework;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, to urge the Committee on Rules, along with any other committee it may deem appropriate, to undertake a comprehensive legal audit of all regional laws enacted by the RLA of the former ARMM;

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, that the audit shall include, but not be limited to:
1. The identification of RLA laws still in effect within BARMM;
2. The determination of their consistency with the Bangsamoro Organic Law and other national laws;
3. The evaluation of their continued relevance and policy alignment;
4. Recommendations for amendment, repeal, codification, or integration into new Bangsamoro legislation;

**RESOLVED FINALLY**, that the appropriate committee shall commence the legal audit within thirty (30) days from the adoption of this Resolution, and shall endeavor to complete and submit its findings and recommendations to the Bangsamoro Parliament within one hundred fifty (150) days, unless an extension is warranted and approved by the Bangsamoro Parliament, and to submit the same for appropriate action.
