**WHEREAS**, the study conducted by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 2019, titled "Risk Assessment of Natural Hazards in the Philippines: Synthesis Report," has identified the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) as one of the areas highly vulnerable to a range of natural disasters, including earthquakes, typhoons, floods, and landslides;

**WHEREAS**, the BARMM is highly susceptible to various natural and man-made disasters, posing significant threats to the lives, properties, and well-being of its inhabitants;

**WHEREAS**, the frequency and intensity of disasters in the BARMM region have increased in recent years due to factors such as climate change, rapid urbanization, environmental degradation, and inadequate disaster preparedness and response mechanisms;

**WHEREAS**, House Bill No. 9935, entitled "An Act Institutionalizing a Mechanism on the Declaration of State of Imminent Disaster; Providing the Criteria for Such Declaration and Lifting; Enabling Anticipatory Measures and Providing Funds Therefor," aims to establish a systematic mechanism for declaring a State of Imminent Disaster, enabling proactive and effective response to impending disasters;

**WHEREAS**, the proposed legislation provides clear criteria for declaring a State of Imminent Disaster, including objective indicators such as weather forecasts, hydrological data, geological assessments, and other relevant information, as well as delineating the roles and responsibilities of government agencies, local government units, and stakeholders in disaster management;

**WHEREAS**, House Bill No. 9935 allocates funds for implementing anticipatory measures, including pre-disaster preparedness activities, evacuation and sheltering facilities, emergency response training, and other necessary interventions, thereby enhancing the resilience of communities in the BARMM region to disasters;

**WHEREAS**, passing House Bill No. 9935 into law would contribute significantly to the protection of lives, livelihoods, and properties in the BARMM region, as well as to the promotion of sustainable development and resilience-building efforts;

**NOW, THEREFORE**, be it

**RESOLVED**, by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, as it hereby resolved, expresses its full support for the swift passage of House Bill No. 9935, entitled "An Act Institutionalizing a Mechanism on the Declaration of State of Imminent Disaster; Providing the Criteria for Such Declaration and Lifting; Enabling Anticipatory Measures and Providing Funds Therefor."

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, that copies of this resolution be furnished to the Members of the House of Representatives, particularly Representative Jose Manuel F. Alba, for their reference in prioritizing the deliberations and enactment of this legislation for the benefit of the BARMM region and its inhabitants.
