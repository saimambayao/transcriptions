**RESOLUTION URGING THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY TO ADOPT COMPREHENSIVE GUIDELINES ON THE CONVERSION OF FORESTLANDS AND AGRICULTURAL LANDS INTO HOUSING, INDUSTRIAL, AND TOURISM USES IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM) TO SAFEGUARD FOOD SECURITY, PROTECT ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY, AND PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT**

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is endowed with ecologically significant forestlands and productive agricultural lands that serves as the lifeblood of its food systems, cultural heritage, and biodiversity;

**WHEREAS**, Article II, Section 16 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution mandates the State to "*protect and advance the right of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology in accord with the rhythm and harmony of nature*", a principle further enshrined in Islamic jurisprudence (*hifz al-bi’ah*—environmental stewardship) and Bangsamoro customary law (*adat*);

**WHEREAS**, Article XIII, Section 7 of the Constitution promotes agrarian reform and sustainable natural resource management for equitable access, particularly benefiting farmers, Indigenous Peoples, and traditional forest dwellers;

**WHEREAS**, Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law, mandates the protection of ancestral domains and natural resources, promoting inclusive and sustainable development based on Islamic and customary laws;

**WHEREAS**, Republic Acts No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL) of 1988), 8371 (Indigenous Peoples’ Rights Act of 1997), and 7586 ((National Integrated Protected Areas System (NIPAS) Act of 1992) collectively safeguard agricultural lands, ancestral domains, and protected areas from unsustainable and harmful conversion;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Administrative Code empowers the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Agrarian Reform to regulate land use conversion through regionally appropriate and nationally aligned guidelines;

**WHEREAS**, existing national laws and directives prohibit or restrict conversion in strategic agricultural and ecological zones to maintain food security and environmental stability;

**WHEREAS**, Republic Acts No. 9729 (Climate Change Act of 2009) and 10174 ((The People’s Survival Fund Act) require the integration of climate resilience in land use planning, reinforcing environmental protection and disaster risk reduction;

**WHEREAS**, the BARMM 12-Point Priority Agenda and Sustainable Development Plan identify environmental stewardship and reforestation as central to regional progress;

**WHEREAS**, widespread deforestation and unregulated land conversion in Mindanao, including BARMM, have weakened ecosystems and increased disaster vulnerability, highlighting the urgency of land use governance;

**WHEREAS**, the impacts of Tropical Storm Paeng and similar disasters demonstrate the grave consequences of environmental neglect, reinforcing the need to protect upland areas and watersheds;

**WHEREAS**, decades of conflict and challenges in management have degraded forests and water sources, endangering community safety and linking environmental protection with peacebuilding efforts;

**WHEREAS**, unregulated conversion of forests and farmlands for non-agricultural uses threatens food security, displaces Indigenous and farming communities, and increases climate risk. Given BARMM’s high food insecurity rates, safeguarding productive lands is critical;

**WHEREAS**, there is an urgent need for a participatory, science-based, and enforceable land conversion policy that balances development with environmental and social responsibilities;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Government must establish a comprehensive policy to protect critical natural assets while guiding responsible development for housing, industry, and tourism consistent with sustainable development principles;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, to respectfully urge the Government of the Day to formulate and adopt comprehensive and legally binding guidelines on the conversion of forestlands and agricultural lands in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. These guidelines must be developed through participatory processes with:

*   The Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources, and Energy (MENRE)
*   The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Agrarian Reform (MAFAR)
*   The Ministry of Indigenous Peoples’ Affairs (MIPA)
*   Local Government Units (LGUs)
*   Civil Society Organizations (CSOs)
*   Indigenous Peoples and affected farming communities

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, that the guidelines shall:

1.  Prohibit indiscriminate conversion of prime agricultural and forest lands (as classified under DAR Administrative Order No. 1, Series of 2009) and critical forestlands (including watersheds and protected areas under NIPA);
2.  Establish strict criteria for permissible land conversion, including:
    o   Proof of food security impact assessment;
    o   Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) compliance under PD 1586;
    o   Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) from affected ICCs/IPs under RA 8371;
3.  Strengthen enforcement mechanisms, including penalties for illegal conversions and a transparent review process involving multi-stakeholder oversight;
4.  Align with the BARMM Regional Land Use Policy, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the Bangsamoro Development Plan; and
5.  Promote climate-smart agriculture and reforestation as part of long-term environmental management.

**RESOLVED FINALLY**, that copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Office of the Chief Minister, the Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority, and all concerned ministries for their prompt and appropriate action.

Adopted,
