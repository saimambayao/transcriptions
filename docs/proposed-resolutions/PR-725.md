**WHEREAS**, Section 4, Article II of the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines states that the primary duty of the Government is to serve and protect the people;

**WHEREAS**, one of the declared policies of the State, as provided in the 1987 Constitution, is to promote a just and dynamic social order that will ensure the prosperity and independence of the nation and free the people from poverty through policies that provide adequate social services, promote full employment, a rising standard of living, and an improved quality of life (Section 9, Article II);

**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Article IV of R.A. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), provides that in the exercise of its right to self-governance, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is free to pursue its political, economic, social, and cultural development as provided for in the Organic Law;

**WHEREAS**, Section 3, Article V of the BOL provides for general welfare, which states that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the powers expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance, and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants;

**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Article VII of the BOL states that the powers of government shall be vested in the Parliament, which shall exercise those powers and functions expressly granted to it in this Organic Law, and those necessary for, or incidental to, the proper governance and development of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. It shall set policies, legislate on matters within its authority, and elect a Chief Minister who shall exercise executive authority on its behalf;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is governed by Republic Act No. 12009, or “An Act Revising Republic Act No. 9184, Otherwise Known as the ‘Government Procurement Reform Act,’ and for Other Purposes”;

**WHEREAS**, BARMM is committed to bringing the government closer to the people by strengthening governance mechanisms and delivering timely, responsive, and transparent public services across all its provinces and communities;

**WHEREAS**, the principles of subsidiarity and devolution in public administration encourage decision-making and resource allocation at the level closest to the people, ensuring that policies and services are responsive to local conditions and needs;

**WHEREAS**, timely procurement is essential for the effective implementation of programs and projects, particularly in health, education, infrastructure, and disaster response, where delays may adversely affect public welfare;

**WHEREAS**, decentralized procurement can enhance civic engagement and local oversight by increasing the visibility and accessibility of procurement processes to local stakeholders, civil society organizations, and community leaders;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP) emphasizes inclusive governance and service delivery at the local level, which necessitates the empowerment of provincial and district offices with operational functions, including procurement;

**WHEREAS**, the majority of Bangsamoro Ministries, Offices, and Agencies (BMOAs) have established provincial or district offices;

**WHEREAS**, among the major Bangsamoro Ministries, Offices, and Agencies (BMOAs) with established structures on the ground are the Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education (MBHTE), Ministry of Public Works (MPW), Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry of the Interior and Local Government (MILG), Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Agrarian Reform (MAFAR), and Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources, and Energy (MENRE);

**WHEREAS**, the MPW has decentralized some of its procurement to its District Engineering Offices (DEOs) for a limited range of projects;

**WHEREAS**, during the deliberation of the MOH’s budget for 2025, the Committee on Finance, Budget, and Management (CFBM), affirmed by the Bangsamoro Parliament, directed the ministry to decentralize the procurement of some projects, especially those with a direct impact on the communities;

**WHEREAS**, the experience of some ministries in limited decentralized procurement demonstrates its feasibility and the potential benefits of expanding such practice across BMOAs with sufficient institutional capacity and safeguards;

**WHEREAS**, many BMOAs remain heavily centralized in their procurement processes, often resulting in delays, logistical challenges, and missed opportunities to support local economies;

**WHEREAS**, decentralized procurement, if properly implemented and monitored, allows local offices to respond more swiftly to the specific and urgent needs of their constituents, while enhancing transparency and accountability through proximity and citizen engagement;

**WHEREAS**, empowering provincial and district offices with procurement functions would not only streamline operations and reduce bottlenecks but also build local capacities, strengthen the institutional presence of BMOAs at the grassroots level, and promote good governance;

**WHEREAS**, decentralization in procurement must be accompanied by strict safeguards, clear guidelines, training, and oversight mechanisms to prevent misuse, ensure compliance with procurement laws and regulations, and uphold the principles of integrity and efficiency;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved, to urge the Office of the Chief Minister (OCM) to implement a policy for decentralized procurement by Bangsamoro Ministries, Offices, and Agencies (BMOAs) through their provincial and district offices;

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, that the said policy shall provide the necessary framework, safeguards, and capacity-building support to ensure that decentralized procurement is carried out in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and audit standards;

**RESOLVED FINALLY**, that copies of this Resolution be furnished to the Office of the Chief Minister, the Ministry of Finance, Budget, and Management, and all concerned ministries for their information and appropriate action.
