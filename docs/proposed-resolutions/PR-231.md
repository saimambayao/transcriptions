**WHEREAS**, Section 9, Article II of the 1987 Constitution provides that the State shall promote a just and dynamic social order that will ensure the prosperity and independence of the nation and free the people from poverty through policies that provide adequate social services, promote full employment, a rising standard of living, and an improved quality of life for all;

**WHEREAS**, Section 6, Article IV of Republic Act 11054, otherwise known as the “Bangsamoro Organic Law” states that the Bangsamoro Government shall promote unity, peace, justice, and goodwill among all peoples, as well as encourage a just and peaceful settlement of disputes;

**WHEREAS**, Par. (b), Section 3, Article IX of the 1987 Constitution provides that the Civil Service Commission, as the central personnel agency of the Government, shall establish a career service and adopt measures to promote morale, efficiency, integrity, responsiveness, progressiveness, and courtesy in the civil service;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Region is a melting pot of cultures with people from different walks of life co-existing with one another towards peace, harmony, and progress;

**WHEREAS**, along with the multitude of cultures and traditions in the region comes the needed respect and courtesy towards another’s values and beliefs that need to be continuously reinforced and reminded to all public servants who are stationed in the Bangsamoro Region;

**WHEREAS**, lack of courtesy and sensitivity to another’s culture and the disregard thereof could become a source of dispute and conflict, especially in a region where most of the people pride themselves on the rich culture and heritage of their ancestors, such as what we have in the Region;

**WHEREAS**, the members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police would also benefit from becoming more culturally sensitive as they are working closely with the constituents to protect their respective areas of assignments and are converging with the different cultures of the Bangsamoro Region on a daily basis;

**WHEREAS**, a cultural sensitivity seminar will help strengthening respect to other cultures existing in the Bangsamoro Region;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, BY THE BANGSAMORO PARLIAMENT, to call on the BANGSAMORO CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION TO DEVELOP AND INSTITUTIONALIZE A CULTURAL SENSITIVITY TRAINING/SEMINAR FOR ALL PUBLIC SERVANTS STATIONED IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO INCLUDING THOSE IN THE ARMED FORCES OF THE PHILIPPINES AND THE PHILIPPINE NATIONAL POLICE.
