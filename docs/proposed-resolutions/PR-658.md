**A RESOLUTION STRENGTHENING THE ROLE OF TRIBAL COUNCILS IN THE PROPER HANDLING OF RAPE CASES IN INDIGENOUS PEOPLES (IP) COMMUNITIES**

**Whereas**, culture is a code of conduct and morality that should uphold the right of each member of the Indigenous Peoples (IP) communities, and hence should not be used as justification in defence of rape cases;

**Whereas**, suggesting that rape does not occur in IP communities by forcing a victim to marry the rapist is a myth that only perpetuates injustice against women, and should be denounced and eliminated;

**Whereas**, it is a false belief that there is no rape in IP traditions, as sexual violence is considered a grave offense (such as “Meduf Tiyawan”) that must observe international, national, and regional laws;

**Whereas**, it is contrary to the cultural value of protection to allow sexual abuse of individuals with mental disabilities, who are considered children, and to allow repeated rape in the context of arranged and forced marriage, and hence should be treated as serious crimes, demanding full accountability under the law;

**Whereas**, according to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), harmful cultural practices and traditions that endanger women's safety must be reviewed and reformed to protect women from harm. Globally, rape is considered a "crime against humanity," and perpetrators should be held accountable at the international level if necessary;

**Whereas**, Section 4 of the MMA 241 recognizes, respects, protects, and promotes the rights of indigenous women and calls for the strengthening of their roles in governance, justice systems, and customary laws. It emphasizes the need to review and eliminate discriminatory practices, ensure the participation of IP women, and address violence against women and children;

**Whereas**, obstructing justice by attempting to mediate rape cases, regardless of whether the perpetrator is motivated by so-called love or any other reason, is unlawful.

Rape is a public and heinous crime, with penalties under RA 8353 including life imprisonment or reclusion perpetua without the possibility of bail;

**Now, therefore, be it resolved** that the tribal council, as the recognized authority in Indigenous Peoples' governance, shall take a leading role in the proper handling of rape cases in IP communities through the following actions:

1. **Reinforce Awareness**: Launch awareness and education campaigns to eliminate myths that justify or downplay the severity of rape in IP communities. Ensure the dissemination of correct information about women’s rights and existing laws protecting victims of sexual violence.
2. **Review and Reform Customary Practices**: Review existing customary practices, especially those concerning the settlement of rape cases. Prohibit practices that are highly unfavorable to women, such as the amicable settlement of rape through marriage or compensation.
3. **Collaboration with Legal Authorities**: Work closely with the national justice system to ensure that all rape cases are handled according to national and international laws, and perpetrators face appropriate legal consequences. Ensure that no cultural “defense” obstructs justice.
4. **Empower IP Women**: Create and implement programs that encourage the participation of IP women in tribal governance, conflict management, and leadership roles. Recognize the important roles of IP women as arbiters, traditional healers, and leaders in maintaining justice within their communities.
5. **Protection of Vulnerable Individuals**: Protect the rights of individuals with disabilities by ensuring they are not exposed to dangerous situations, and that any cases of violence against them are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
6. **Strengthen Tribal Governance**: Build the capacity of tribal councils to handle rape cases in a manner that aligns with the rights of victims as stipulated under both customary laws and national legislation, including respect for due process and gender sensitivity.

**Be it further resolved**, that these actions shall be taken in accordance with the MMA 241 and other applicable laws, ensuring the rights and protection of IP women and children in all communities.
