**WHEREAS**, Section 10, Article XVI of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the “Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (OLBARMM)”, mandates the adherence to an independent, merit-based, and credible placement and hiring process for all offices, agencies, and institutions within the Bangsamoro Government;

**WHEREAS**, Civil Service Resolution No. 1800692, also known as the “2017 Omnibus Rules on Appointments and Other Human Resource Actions”, reaffirms the Constitutional mandate on merit- and fitness-based appointments in the Civil Service, considering education, experience, training, and eligibility as part of qualification standards and strict protocols in the hiring process;

**WHEREAS**, Bangsamoro Autonomy Act (BAA) No. 17, otherwise known as the “Bangsamoro Civil Service Code of 2021”, fortifies the adoption of an independent and credible merit and fitness system, the protection of civil service eligibles in government positions, and the security of tenure of civil service officers and employees in the Bangsamoro Government;

**WHEREAS**, Article 9 of the same Code advances the same thrust in the Bangsamoro career service, viz:

> “Article 9. Career Service. The Bangsamoro career service shall be characterized by (1) entrance based on merit and fitness to be determined as far as practicable by competitive examinations; (2) opportunity for advancement to higher career positions; and (3) security of tenure.”

**WHEREAS**, all permanent employees of Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) appointed by the Honorable Speaker Atty. Pangalian M. Balindong and duly attested by the Civil Service Commission (CSC) for BARMM, have successfully met all the qualifications and requirements as outlined in the merit- and fitness-based hiring process, thereby ensuring their eligibility and capability to fulfill the responsibilities of their positions with competence and integrity, and consequently, they also enjoy security of tenure in accordance with law;

**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Article XVI of the OLBARMM states that the BTA shall serve as the interim government in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region during the transition period;

**WHEREAS**, Section 1, Article XVI of the OLBARMM provides that the end of the transition period shall be upon the dissolution of the BTA;

**WHEREAS**, Section 12, Article XVI of the OLBARMM specifically articulates that the dissolution of the BTA shall be immediately upon the election and qualification of the Chief Minister under the first Parliament;

**WHEREAS**, Section 1 of Republic Act No. 12123, “An Act Resetting the First Regular Elections in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, Amending for the Purpose, Section 13, Article XVI of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the “Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao”, which was enacted on February 19, 2025, ultimately set the first BARMM Parliamentary elections on October 13, 2025, with subsequent elections aligning with the 2028 national elections and occurring every three years thereafter;

**WHEREAS**, the establishment of the first regular Bangsamoro Parliament after the October 2025 parliamentary elections shall entail the dissolution of the BTA;

**WHEREAS**, Section 4 of Republic Act No. 6656, “An Act to Protect the Security of Tenure of Civil Service Officers and Employees in the Implementation of Government Reorganization”, reiterates the implementation of the State’s policy of protecting the security of tenure of officers and employees in the Civil Service during the reorganization of government agencies, thus:

> “SECTION 4. Officers and employees holding permanent appointments shall be given preference for appointment to the new positions in the approved staffing pattern comparable to their former position or in case there are not enough comparable positions, to positions next lower in rank.
>
> No new employees shall be taken in until all permanent officers and employees have been appointed, including temporary and casual employees who possess the necessary qualification requirements, among which is the appropriate civil service eligibility, for permanent appointment to positions in the approved staffing pattern, in case there are still positions to be filled, unless such positions are policy-determining, primarily confidential or highly technical in nature.”

**WHEREAS**, Article 215 of BAA No. 17, otherwise known as the “Bangsamoro Civil Service Code of 2021”, sets forth the same rule for the preference of officers and employees with permanent appointments in case of government reorganization;

**WHEREAS**, the Supreme Court has consistently upheld a strong presumption against an intent to create a vacuum in government offices that will disrupt the efficient functioning of the government, which is contrary to public policy, interest and welfare¹;

**WHEREAS**, the Supreme Court also underscores that the conduct of reorganization in government office should be with utmost care to ensure the constitutional mandate of security of tenure is not compromised², viz:

> “A reorganization in good faith is one designed to trim the fat off the bureaucracy and institute economy and greater efficiency in its operation. It is not a mere tool of the spoils system to change the face of the bureaucracy and destroy the livelihood of hordes of career employees in the civil service so that the new-powers-that-be may put their own people in control of the machinery of government.
> 
> As a general rule, a reorganization is carried out in "good faith" if it is for the purpose of economy or to make bureaucracy more efficient. In that event no dismissal or separation actually occurs because the position itself ceases to exist. And in that case the security of tenure would not be a Chinese wall. Be that as it may, if the abolition which is nothing else but a separation or removal, is done for political reason or purposely to defeat security of tenure, or otherwise not in good faith, no valid abolition takes place and whatever abolition is done is void ab initio. There is an invalid abolition as where there is merely a change of nomenclature of positions or where claims of economy are belied by the existence of ample funds.”

**WHEREAS**, the “Enhanced Transition Plan 2019-2022 for the Bangsamoro Transition Authority” which was approved through Adopted Resolution No. 12 dated June 17, 2019, also provided for the same goal to facilitate proper transition from the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) to the BARMM, aiming for the least possible disruption of government performance, including the continuance of permanent employees in their positions, in the creation, merging, and phasing out of offices and employees, viz:

> “The creation, merging, and phasing out of offices and employees shall ensure the least possible disruption to the delivery of basic services and to the overall performance of the BARMM. As such, coterminous employees, as the nature of their employment implies, must end their services simultaneously to the one who appointed them. For those holding casual, contractual, job order, and contract of service positions, their contracts will generally be honored, subject to a review of the nature of the job and their performance. Permanent/plantilla employees shall continue in their respective positions subject to the proposed phasing out plan.”

**WHEREAS**, the phase-out plan for accountable officers of the ARMM has undergone three extensions, with Adopted Resolution No. 95 of the BTA recognizing that these employees cannot be easily replaced with new hires due to the length of time required to complete the hiring process, and thus ultimately setting the end of the phasing-out process on June 30, 2021, a span of two years since its approval in June 2019;

**WHEREAS**, by reason of the said transition plan, the BTA, since August 2021, hired a total of **249** appointees out of the **342** plantilla positions as of December 31, 2024, a complement expected to be fully staffed within the current fiscal year;

**WHEREAS**, since its establishment, the BTA has continuously invested in capacity-building and development programs for its employees, equipping them with the necessary skills and expertise to effectively support the institution’s legislative, administrative, and operational functions;

**WHEREAS**, as a result of these efforts, the functions of the BTA have significantly improved through the contributions of its permanent employees, who have developed specialized knowledge in their respective fields, providing essential support to the Members of the Parliament (MPs) in parliamentary-owned plans, activities, and

projects, committee and plenary affairs, legislative measures enhancement, sound management covering administrative and financial management for activities, and constituent services, thereby enhancing the efficiency, continuity, and effectiveness of the institution’s operations;

**WHEREAS**, the first regular Bangsamoro Parliament will require a competent and skilled workforce to ensure the seamless transition from the BTA and the uninterrupted functioning of its legislative, administrative, and financial operations;

**WHEREAS**, the experienced and trained personnel of the BTA, who have been permanently appointed by the Honorable Speaker Atty. Pangalian M. Balindong and duly attested by the CSC, possess the parliamentary knowledge and technical expertise necessary to support the establishment and reinforcement of the institutional framework of the first regular Bangsamoro Parliament;

**WHEREAS**, ensuring a smooth transition from the BTA to the first regular Bangsamoro Parliament is essential to maintaining governance stability, preserving institutional knowledge, and sustaining the efficient delivery of public services for the benefit of the people of the Bangsamoro Autonomous region;

**WHEREAS**, recognizing the valuable contributions of the current BTA permanent employees and providing them the opportunity to continue their service in the first regular Bangsamoro Parliament would help uphold operational continuity, strengthen institutional capacity, and support the Parliament in fulfilling its mandate effectively.

**NOW, THEREFORE**, be it

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved, that the BTA Parliament upholds and protects the security of tenure of all employees permanently appointed by the Honorable Speaker Atty. Pangalian M. Balindong and duly attested by the CSC, ensuring continuity of their employment beyond the first parliamentary elections, following the dissolution of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority and the creation of the first regular Bangsamoro Parliament;

**RESOLVED FINALLY**, that a copy of this Resolution be furnished to the CSC for BARMM for their consideration and appropriate action.
