**RESOLUTION**

**CALLING ON THE MINISTRY OF TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATION (MOTC) TO REQUIRE SHIPPING COMPANIES PLYING ROUTES OF ZAMBOANGA CITY TO JOLO, SULU, AND VICE VERSA TO PROVIDE AN OPTION FOR PASSENGERS TO PURCHASE THEIR TICKETS ONLINE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF THE PROLIFERATION OF “FIXERS” IN THE PURCHASE OF PASSENGER BOAT TICKETS**

**WHEREAS**, Section 3, Article III of Republic Act 11054, otherwise known as the “Bangsamoro Organic Law,” states that the Bangsamoro Government shall, among others, enhance economic prosperity and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants;

**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Chapter 1, Title XV of the Bangsamoro Administrative Code provides that the Ministry of Transportation and Communication (MOTC) shall be the primary policy, planning, programming, coordinating, implementing, regulating, and administrative entity of the Bangsamoro Government in the promotion, development, and regulation of dependable and coordinated networks of transportation and communications system as well as fast, safe, efficient and reliable transportation and communications services;

**WHEREAS**, sea travel is vital and essential for the Bangsamoro people residing in BASULTA – Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi;

**WHEREAS**, in recent weeks, one of the worsening problems that sea vessel passengers encounter is regarding the difficulty of purchasing tickets and the proliferation of “fixers” for sea trips from Zamboanga to Jolo, Sulu, and vice versa;

**WHEREAS**, in the past weeks, hundreds of passengers have needed to line up as early as 2 am in Jolo port and even in the Zamboanga ticketing outlets just to be able to get a chance to purchase tickets;

**WHEREAS**, even the regional employees of BARMM are experiencing these difficulties where tickets are already unavailable three (3) days before the scheduled trip, and travelers need to wait for several days to be able to go to Jolo or return to Zamboanga;

**WHEREAS**, this large discrepancy in the demand for travel to and from Sulu compared to the available transport has brought in ticket syndicates that take advantage of the situation and make passengers pay as much as 1.5 times the original cost of the ticket;

**WHEREAS**, this situation affects government service delivery as well as the emerging tourism industry in Sulu, which is frequented by local tourists from Western Mindanao;

**WHEREAS**, according to a Zamboanga City local news article, a total of six (6) fixers were apprehended by the Zamboanga City Police Station 11 after they were caught selling passenger tickets to Jolo at double the price to travelers going to the Island province of Sulu last April 19, 2023;¹

**WHEREAS**, passengers intending to buy tickets at the ticketing outlets several days prior are often told that there are no more available tickets and that their prospective trip is already fully booked, only to be offered overpriced tickets by fixers.

**WHEREAS**, the online purchasing of tickets will bypass the “fixers” that are hoarding tickets just to be resold at 1.5 to 2 times the original price;

**WHEREAS**, an option to purchase tickets online would provide a more transparent, convenient, and fair method of procuring tickets while also rendering the modus operandi of “fixers” ineffective;

**WHEREAS**, so much time, money, resources, and opportunities are lost and wasted with the needless lines by hundreds of passengers wanting to travel only to be taken advantage of unscrupulous “fixers”;

**WHEREAS**, the LGUs of Zamboanga City and Sulu have been trying to address this issue, but the solution seems to be too elusive, which may need the use of innovative ways such as technology and the online platform of the internet;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED** by the Bangsamoro Parliament, TO CALL ON THE MINISTRY OF TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATION (MOTC) TO REQUIRE SHIPPING COMPANIES PLYING ROUTES OF ZAMBOANGA CITY TO JOLO, SULU, AND VICE VERSA TO PROVIDE AN OPTION FOR PASSENGERS TO PURCHASE THEIR TICKETS ONLINE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF THE PROLIFERATION OF “FIXERS” IN THE PURCHASE OF PASSENGER BOAT TICKETS.
