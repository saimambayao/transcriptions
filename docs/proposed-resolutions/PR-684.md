**A RESOLUTION URGING THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH (MOH) BARMM TO ACTIVELY ENGAGE WITH THE PHILIPPINE MULTI-SECTORAL NUTRITION PROJECT (PMNP) IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS NUTRITIONAL PROGRAM**

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Organic Law (Republic Act No. 11054) mandates the Bangsamoro Government to protect and promote the right to health of its people, ensuring accessible and essential health services for all, including nutrition programs that address malnutrition and stunting;

**WHEREAS**, Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the "Local Government Code of 1991," upholds the principle of decentralization, requiring national government agencies to coordinate with local government units (LGUs) and provide technical and material assistance for effective policy implementation, including health and nutrition programs;

**WHEREAS**, malnutrition remains a pressing concern in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), with the 2021 Expanded National Nutrition Survey (ENNS) reporting a stunting rate of approximately 39%, significantly above the national average of 26%, necessitating urgent, coordinated, and multi-sectoral interventions;

**WHEREAS**, the Philippine Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Project (PMNP), spearheaded by the Department of Health (DOH) in collaboration with the World Bank and other stakeholders, aims to combat chronic malnutrition through integrated and evidence-based nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions, particularly in high-burden regions like BARMM;

**WHEREAS**, the PMNP employs a multi-sectoral approach by engaging various agencies, including health, social welfare, and local governance sectors, to comprehensively address the underlying causes of malnutrition and ensure sustainable solutions;

**WHEREAS**, the Ministry of Health (MOH) BARMM, as the primary health authority in the region, is responsible for setting health policies, implementing strategic health programs, and ensuring the delivery of healthcare services, making its active participation in PMNP crucial to addressing the region's specific nutritional challenges;

**WHEREAS**, MOH BARMM's engagement in PMNP will enhance coordination with national and international partners, leverage additional resources, and implement targeted interventions in geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas (GIDAs) where nutrition-related health issues are most severe;

**WHEREAS**, the Ministry of Social Services and Development (MSSD) BARMM, through its social protection programs such as conditional cash transfers and community-based interventions, plays a complementary role in reinforcing the health and nutrition initiatives of MOH, ensuring a holistic approach to addressing malnutrition;

**WHEREAS**, the effective implementation of PMNP in BARMM aligns with the national government's commitment to improving child health outcomes and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 2, which aims to end hunger and malnutrition in all its forms;

**NOW, THEREFORE**, be it

**RESOLVED**, by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, as it hereby resolves, to urge the Ministry of Health (MOH) BARMM to fully participate in and facilitate the implementation of the Philippine Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Project (PMNP) to improve the region's nutritional outcomes;

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, that the MOH BARMM be tasked to coordinate with relevant ministries, local government units, and stakeholders to ensure the effective execution of the PMNP and to secure the necessary support for its long-term sustainability;

**RESOLVED, FINALLY**, that copies of this resolution be furnished to the Ministry of Health (MOH) BARMM, the Office of the Chief Minister, the Ministry of Social Services and Development (MSSD), and other relevant agencies for their information and necessary action.

**ADOPTED**,

(Sgd.)
