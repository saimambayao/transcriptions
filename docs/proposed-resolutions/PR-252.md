**RESOLUTION**

**URGING THE BANGSAMORO MINISTRIES, OFFICES, AGENCIES, AND COMMISSIONS TO PROCURE STARLINK SATELLITE SERVICES IN THEIR FIELD OFFICES LOCATED IN AREAS WITH WEAK INTERNET CONNECTION TO IMPROVE THEIR OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR REGIONAL OFFICES AND STAKEHOLDERS**

**WHEREAS**, Section 4, Article II of R.A. No. 7925, otherwise known as the Public Telecommunications Policy Act of the Philippines, states that telecommunications are essential to the economic development, integrity, and security of the Philippines, and as such shall be developed and administered as to safeguard, enrich and strengthen the economic, cultural, social and political fabric of the Philippines;

**WHEREAS**, telecommunications is of vital importance in the community as an instrument to achieve good governance, economic development, access to high-quality education, development of technology in healthcare, investments, social welfare, security, and awareness for environmental issues;

**WHEREAS**, access to the internet in some jurisdictions is already one of the basic needs and one of the human rights aside from being an essential tool to take advantage of technological advancements and globalization;

**WHEREAS**, according to the latest National ICT Household survey, 99.1% of the barangays in the Bangsamoro Region do not have any Fiber Optic Cable facility installed, and 31.6% of the communities in the Bangsamoro Region do not have any cellphone signal¹;

**WHEREAS**, most of the offices in the Bangsamoro are utilizing outdated satellite technology that uses satellites that are very far from the Earth to send internet signals to Earth, which made it not only very expensive but also with very limited data cap that hinders its effectiveness;

**WHEREAS**, in the past years, Elon Musk developed a low-orbit satellite technology that enables it to transfer internet signals to Earth in a cheaper manner and with faster speeds as well as much higher data capacity;

**WHEREAS**, recently Starlink has provided the Philippines access to this low orbit satellite technology that allows most of the communities in the Bangsamoro the potential to access the internet even if they do not have access to cellphone signals;

**WHEREAS**, the internet plays a central role in the fundamental operations of society, from business to government to families;

**WHEREAS**, reliable internet connectivity would be instrumental in all Bangsamoro Offices and Ministries as it would improve the coordination between the said offices, which usually suffers due to the lack of cellular and broadband coverage in many areas of the Bangsamoro;

**WHEREAS**, Starlink offers high-speed broadband with exceptionally low latency, which has many applications that provide communications, as well as for educational purposes, with little to no hassle during the installation process of the satellite hardware;

**WHEREAS**, this has the potential to provide even school children in geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas to access the internet for research and information;

**WHEREAS**, according to Starlink’s Coverage Map, the company claims to be able to offer satellite internet connectivity to all areas of the Philippine Archipelago;

**WHEREAS**, some of the offices of the Bangsamoro located in far-flung areas of the Region are now utilizing the Internet connectivity being offered by Starlink, as the hardware can be easily installed without the need to wait for a local signal tower to be built near the area;

**WHEREAS**, Starlink will be able to deliver stable and efficient connectivity for the Ministries and Offices of the Bangsamoro Government and will ensure more timely and responsive delivery of the services being provided by the Bangsamoro Government;

**WHEREAS**, increased access to the internet by government offices and students in isolated communities will have a revolutionary impact on making these communities catch up with the rest of the world;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED** by the Bangsamoro Parliament, TO URGE THE BANGSAMORO MINISTRIES, OFFICES, AGENCIES, AND COMMISSIONS TO PROCURE STARLINK SATELLITE SERVICES IN THEIR FIELD OFFICES LOCATED IN AREAS WITH WEAK INTERNET CONNECTION TO IMPROVE THEIR OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR REGIONAL OFFICES AND STAKEHOLDERS.
