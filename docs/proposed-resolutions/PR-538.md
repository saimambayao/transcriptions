**RESOLUTION**
**URGING THE BANGSAMORO PILGRIMAGE AUTHORITY (BPA) TO UNDERTAKE AN IN-DEPTH STUDY AND ASSESSMENT ON THE 2023 PHILIPPINE HAJJ EXPERIENCE AND PROPOSE VIABLE POLICY AND EXECUTIVE SOLUTIONS TO THE IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES**

**WHEREAS,** Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, and all financially and physically able Muslims are required to perform it at least once in their lives;

**WHEREAS,** the Hajj pilgrimage comprises a series of rites and rituals that can be physically, emotionally, and spiritually challenging for some pilgrims;

**WHEREAS,** according to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), there were about 7,200 Filipino pilgrims who went to Saudi Arabia to perform Hajj this year¹ and a significant number of these pilgrims were from the Bangsamoro Region;

**WHEREAS,** the BPA has primary jurisdiction over Hajj matters affecting pilgrims from within the Bangsamoro as per Book IV, Title III, Chapter 3, [E] of the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 13, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Administrative Code, which provides in part, *viz*:

> “**Sec. 43. The Bangsamoro Pilgrimage Authority.** – *The Bangsamoro Government shall have primary jurisdiction over Hajj and Umrah matters affecting pilgrims from within the Bangsamoro.* **The Bangsamoro Pilgrimage Authority shall act in close coordination with the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos on Hajj and Umrah matters to ensure that the pilgrims from the Bangsamoro are provided with the same level of services as those from outside.**
> 
> “**Sec. 44. Mandate.** – *The Bangsamoro Pilgrimage Authority is primarily responsible for the administration of the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia of pilgrims from within the Bangsamoro.* **It shall formulate and implement programs, projects, and activities for the efficient administration and supervision of the conduct of pilgrimage activities of the Bangsamoro pilgrims**; x-x-x-x”

**WHEREAS,** BPA is the counterpart of the NCMF in the administration of the annual pilgrimage among the pilgrims within the Bangsamoro Region;

**WHEREAS,** the NCMF has crafted the Hajj Operations Manual of 2023 which embodies the policies and procedures on Hajj operations with respect to the Commission’s functions as mandated by law²;

**WHEREAS,** the Operations Manual was formulated to improve the services of NCMF in relation to the Hajj operations and to identify and define the responsibilities and accountabilities of every individual involved in the Hajj operations;

**WHEREAS,** despite the crafting of the Operations Manual, many of the 2023 pilgrims were disappointed with the services they received during the Hajj as they expressed their respective grievances and dissatisfaction on various social media platforms;

**WHEREAS,** the complaints include, among others, the following: a) *lack of transparency as to how the money was allocated*; b) *lack of information on who was responsible for billeting, food, and transportation*; c) *inadequate briefing and orientation of Jumaah*; d) *lack of dedicated National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF) staff to assist the pilgrims in every stage of the Hajj*; e) *disappointing food service*; f) *delayed and inadequate transportation*; g) *intermittent water supply in hotels*; h) *overcrowded accommodations*; and i) *flight delays*;

**WHEREAS,** national news outlets also published reports that more than 200 Filipino Hajj pilgrims were stranded in Muzdalifah, near Mecca in Saudi Arabia³;

**WHEREAS,** the BPA, being primarily responsible for the administration of the Hajj of pilgrims from the Bangsamoro Region needs to undertake an in-depth study and assessment on the 2023 Philippine Hajj experience of the pilgrims from the BARMM, and therefrom propose viable policy and executive solutions for the efficient administration and supervision of the Hajj of pilgrims from the BARMM;

**WHEREAS,** the BPA shall also forward the data gathered and proposed solutions and formulated programs, projects, and activities to the NCMF for its consideration;

**WHEREAS,** by urging the BPA to conduct an in-depth study and assessment of the 2023 Philippine Hajj operations, and cross-check the actual experiences of the pilgrims from the BARMM from what is articulated in the Operations Manual, as a guide, the Parliament can help in securing a smooth, efficient and systematic administration and supervision of the conduct of Hajj activities for every Bangsamoro Hujjaj;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED, BY THE BANGSAMORO PARLIAMENT, TO URGE THE BANGSAMORO PILGRIMAGE AUTHORITY (BPA) TO UNDERTAKE AN IN-DEPTH STUDY AND ASSESSMENT ON THE 2023 PHILIPPINE HAJJ EXPERIENCE AND PROPOSE VIABLE POLICY AND EXECUTIVE SOLUTIONS TO THE IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES;**

**RESOLVED, FINALLY,** that copies of this resolution be furnished to the Office of the Chief Minister and the office of the Bangsamoro Pilgrimage Authority.
