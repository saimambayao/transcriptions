**RESOLUTION**

**CALLING ON THE BANGSAMORO MINISTRIES, COMMISSIONS, AND OFFICES TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THE PRINCIPLE OF “5S LEAN METHOD” IN THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICES TO PROMOTE PRODUCTIVITY, CLEANLINESS, ORDER, AND SAFETY**

**WHEREAS**, 5S involves the removal of unnecessary items in the workspace, thus improving productivity with minimal waste of time and promoting a clean working environment to reduce or eliminate work-related injuries;

**WHEREAS**, previous studies have repeatedly shown positive relationships between the successful implementation of 5S, particularly when looking at overall productivity-related topics, including safety, quality, and cost, as well as employee attitudes;

**WHEREAS**, 5S Lean is designed to decrease waste while optimizing productivity through maintaining an orderly workplace and using visual cues to attain more consistent operational results through the adoption and integration of the following principles, to wit:

1. **Seiri (Sort)** - involves eliminating all unnecessary items in the workplace. Decluttering helps you keep stock of tools, supplies, and equipment in the workplace and get rid of those that need to be discarded. Sorting an area out, removing any clutter, and ensuring the only items in an area are those that are strictly required will eliminate obstacles. There are fewer items to run into, trip over, catch on fire, or cause other types of damage. A well-sorted workplace is a safer workplace;

2. **Seiton (Set in Order)** - involves organizing items in readily accessible and safe locations in the workspace. This requires an assessment of storage spaces and methods for efficient visual management. Items shall be kept in optimal location;

3. **Seiso (Shine)** - comes after one has decluttered the workspace and stored items in their proper locations. Seiso involves the thorough cleaning of tools, equipment, workspaces, and facilities every day. This is critical in sustaining the improvements gained in the Seiri and Seiton stages;

4. **Seiketsu (Standardize)** - standardizes the practices implemented in the Seiri, Seiton, and Seiso stages. This helps consistently gain the benefits of the first three stages of the 5S method. The practices will become the new norm for the organization, replacing the inefficient old habits;

5. **Shitsuke (Sustain)** - involves a commitment by all organization members to maintain the improvements made in the Seiri, Seiton, and Seiso stages. This requires one to develop a formal system that includes training workers and disseminating information about new practices on health and safety.

**WHEREAS**, through the employment of waste reduction measures being introduced by the 5S Lean Method, office injuries like trips and slips would be minimized, if not eliminated, as well as significantly reducing workplace susceptibility to severe accidents like fires;

**WHEREAS**, currently, the National Government, through the Development Academy of the Philippines, has institutionalized the integration of the 5S Lean Method in the public sector by aiding offices in the formulation of their official policies to adopt the 5S Lean Method, and it would be beneficial that the Bangsamoro institutionalizes the same;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED, BY THE PARLIAMENT**, to **CALL ON THE BANGSAMORO MINISTRIES AND COMMISSIONS TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THE PRINCIPLE OF “5S LEAN METHOD” IN THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICES TO PROMOTE PRODUCTIVITY, CLEANLINESS, ORDER, AND SAFETY.**
