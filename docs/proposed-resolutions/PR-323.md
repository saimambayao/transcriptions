**RESOLUTION**
**URGING THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT TO ADOPT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO RECOGNIZE THE USE OF DIGITAL SIGNATURES**

**WHEREAS,** Electronic and Digital Signatures are gradually taking the place of traditional methods of physical or “wet ink” signatures;

**WHEREAS,** notwithstanding the fact that the phrases “electronic signature” and “digital signature” are frequently used interchangeably, the latter is more secure than the former;

**WHEREAS,** Electronic signatures are created and added to contracts by individuals and teams signing or marking the document in some way, while digital signatures, by contrast, are created by software and algorithms;

**WHEREAS,** an Electronic Signature does not show any information that will indicate that the same had been authorized by the owner of the signature, and thus it can be copied or cut and pasted onto another document to misrepresent that it had been signed by somebody when in truth the person had not signed the document¹;

**WHEREAS,** Digital Signature, on the other hand, shows the following information²:

	a) The signature is valid;
	b) The document has not been modified since the signature was applied;
	c) The signer’s identity has been verified;
	d) The signing time is indicated;
	e) The certificate has not been revoked; and
	f) The Department of Science and Technology is the government agency issuing the Certificate of Authority.

**WHEREAS,** other important functions of a Digital Signature include the following³:

	a) After the signature is affixed to a document, the signatory can lock the document to prohibit any other change;
	b) It allows for the confirmation that the document is authentic and coming from a verified source;
	c) The identity of the signatory has been verified by a publicly trusted organization; and
	d) The document has not been tampered with since being digitally signed;

**WHEREAS,** various Government agencies, including the Office of the Solicitor General, Securities and Exchange Commission, Bureau of Internal Revenue, and other Cities and Municipalities have also started using digital signatures;

**WHEREAS,** the Anti-Red Tape Authority has directed government agencies to avail of and recognize the use of Digital Signatures using the Philippine National Public Key Infrastructure (PNPKI);

**WHEREAS,** the Philippine National Public Key Infrastructure of the Department of Information and Communications Technology provides a secure digital signature service using certificates issued and digitally signed by a certificate authority (CA) to which the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authenticates the data source and ensures data has not been tampered with in transit;

**WHEREAS,** the DICT has announced that the application for the digital certificate is offered for free to both public and private agencies, institutions, and organizations;

**WHEREAS,** the recognition and employment of digital signatures will greatly help in expediting the legislative process, especially in filing legislative measures considering that its authors and co-authors will no longer have to be physically present to sign each bill, resolution, and committee report;

**WHEREAS,** it will also minimize the burden on the part of the members of the parliament who reside outside Cotabato City and whose time is usually constrained by the demands of their respective constituencies;

**WHEREAS,** governments around the world have accelerated the shift towards the digitalization of many public services as digital technologies have emerged as a key element of economic and social resilience, especially during times of pandemic;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED,** by the Bangsamoro Parliament, to URGE THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT TO ADOPT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO RECOGNIZE THE USE OF DIGITAL SIGNATURES;

**RESOLVED, FINALLY,** that copies of this resolution be furnished to the Office of the Chief Minister, Office of the Speaker, Office of the Secretary General, and the offices of all the Bangsamoro Ministers.
