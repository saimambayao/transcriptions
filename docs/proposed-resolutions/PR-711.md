**WHEREAS**, the Municipality of South Upi was created through **Presidential Decree No. 1580**, issued by then President Ferdinand E. Marcos on June 11, 1978, carving it out from its mother municipality of Upi and originally referred to as Timanan;

**WHEREAS**, in 1968, indigenous leaders **Macario Modatu** (Commander Little Boy) and **Laureano Mobadon** (Commander Labuyo), with their followers, organized resistance groups for protection from lawlessness, which later led to their surrender in 1976 and request for a separate municipality to allow the **Teduray people self-governance**;
