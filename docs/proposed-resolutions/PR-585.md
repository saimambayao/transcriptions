**EXTENDING PROFOUND GRATITUDE AND APPRECIATION TO THE SUPPORT TO BANGSAMORO TRANSITION (SUBATRA) PROGRAM FOR ITS INVALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO THE SUCCESS OF THE BENCHMARKING ACTIVITY OF THE BTA COMMITTEE ON WOMEN, YOUTH, CHILDREN, AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AT THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND THE SENATE OF THE PHILIPPINES**

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) established the Committee on Women, Youth, Children, and Persons with Disabilities (CWYCP) on 22 November 2022, through the adoption of Resolution No. 268, which provides for the rules, procedures, and practices of the BTA Parliament;

**WHEREAS**, the CWYCP consists of 25 members and exercises jurisdiction over all matters concerning the representation, participation, welfare, and development of women, youth, children, and persons with disabilities within the Bangsamoro region, as outlined in Paragraph 17, Section 3, Rule XII, of BTA Resolution No. 268;

**WHEREAS**, Support to Bangsamoro Transition (SUBATRA) is a 5-year program funded by the European Union, and co-financed by the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID), through an agreement with the Government of the Philippines.¹

**WHEREAS**, the overarching objective of SUBATRA is to assist the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) in laying the groundwork for sustainable peace and development by strengthening the capacities of the region’s institutions during the transition period;

**WHEREAS**, SUBATRA has extended support to the capacity building and other initiatives of CWYCP such as staff training on bill drafting, gender equity and social inclusion (GESI) mainstreaming, gender-sensitive legislation, completed staff work (CSW), and strategic planning;

**WHEREAS**, SUBATRA also facilitated the first Benchmarking Activity for CWYCP over a three-day period from May 7 to 9, 2024. This enabled the scoping and immersion of women members of CWYCP with their national counterparts in the Philippine Congress, such as the House Committee on Women and Gender Equality, and the Senate Committee on Women, Children, Family Relations, and Gender Equality, thereby fostering an meaningful exchange of insights, legislative priorities, and best practices;

**WHEREAS**, SUBATRA generously covered the majority of expenses associated with the Benchmarking Activity, including transportation services, hotel accommodations, meals, and active involvement throughout the actual conduct of the activity;

**WHEREAS**, the unwavering support and collaboration provided by SUBATRA, led by its National Key Expert Atty. Reginald Pastrana and his team, played a pivotal role in ensuring the seamless and successful implementation of the Benchmarking Activity. This support provided an invaluable platform for knowledge exchange and collaboration among participants and underscored SUBATRA's commitment to advancing women empowerment in the Bangsamoro Region;

**WHEREAS**, the resounding success achieved during the Benchmarking Activity stands as a testament to the collective efforts and collaborative spirit exemplified by SUBATRA and CWYCP, further reinforcing their partnership and cooperation;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority is deeply grateful to SUBATRA for its unwavering support and assistance, not only in organizing and executing the Benchmarking Activity of CWYCP at the House of Representatives and the Senate of the Philippines, but also in all its initiatives and contributions to the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved, by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority to extend profound gratitude and appreciation to the Support to Bangsamoro Transition (SUBATRA) Program for its invaluable contribution to the success of the Benchmarking Activity of the BTA Committee on Women, Youth, Children, and Persons with Disabilities at the House of Representatives and the Senate of the Philippines on May 7 to 9, 2024;

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, to present a copy of this resolution to SUBATRA Program as a token of our gratitude and appreciation as well as for this resolution’s necessary effects.
