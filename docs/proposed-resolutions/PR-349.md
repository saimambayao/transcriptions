**A RESOLUTION**
**APPEALING THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT, THROUGH THE HONORABLE AHOD “Al-Hadj Murad” B. EBRAHIM, INTERIM CHIEF MINISTER, BANGSAMORO TRANSITION GOVERNMENT, TO RECOGNIZE THE PROPOSED “LIGAWASAN ENCLAVE ASSOCIATIVE DEVELOPMENT (LEAD) PROGRAM” A PRIORITY TO RESTORE ECOLOGICAL BALANCE ALONG WITH SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITIES IN THE ENCLAVE; AND TO PROVIDE ADMINISTRATIVE, TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THEREFOR, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OR BOTH**

**WHEREAS,** the Ligawasan enclave has abundance of fauna (wildlife) and flora (vegetation) resources, although these resources have been continuously exploited by the dwellers for their survival and other purposes since time immemorial without alternative mechanisms or actions to sustain the existence of these resources;

**WHEREAS,** the depletion of the Ligawasan resources is essentially contributing to ecological imbalance and the usual recurrence of floods. Thus, there is a need to create a space for dynamic interdependence among these resources, develop and apply effective flood control measures and establish socioeconomically enhancing and environmentally friendly programs in such areas as, but not limited to social entrepreneurship, agricultural and fisheries production, and eco-tourism;

**WHEREAS,** a “3-day Ligawasan development-focused Rapid Strategic Planning” was designed and conducted by the Instructional Communication and System Management Circle (ICSMC) composed of PhD-Rural Development students of Cotabato Foundation College of Science and Technology (CFCST) and League of Bangsamoro Organization, Inc. (LBO), upon request and sponsorship of MP Mohammad Kelie U. Antao who owns the general concept of the program, held at the Ace Royale, Barangay Poblacion 8, Midsayap, Cotabato on June 2-4, 2023;

**WHEREAS,** the aforementioned planning-workshop was participated by competent planning officers of concerned ministries and offices of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, who collectively believe that the Ligawasan enclave once fully developed with environmentally friendly multi-faceted interventions would produce amplified and sustainable impact on the lives and environs of the Ligawasan dwellers; and eventually these efforts to establish a progressive Bangsamoro community that can essentially contribute to regional and national socioeconomic development, and gain global recognition. Thus, they worked out the Ligawasan Enclave Associative Development (LEAD) concept, and came up with the program’s 5-Year Strategic Development Plan;

**WHEREAS,** the proposed LEAD program is initially composed of six (6) major components, subject to the final assessment and enhancement of the proposed program by a pool of experts to be constituted by the Bangsamoro government and the latter’s approval of this final draft, to wit:

1) Construction of Mega Dikes, both sides from Barangay Mudseng, Midsayap 1 Cluster to Barangay Damatulan, Midsayap 2 cluster. These dikes, which may have 2-lane 6-meter width, will be separated with a distance between them of approximately 20-40 meters to allow the roaming around of water transportation units, and ferrying people visiting the area from one point to the other. This program component will promote tourism and local economy, aside from its role as a flood control component;

2) On these dikes are food hubs, promoting various native delicacies of fishes found in the marsh. One hub will be assigned one species of fish only. This is in observance of the “One Fish Product-One Restaurant” policy of the program;

3) Preservation and production of fishery species by clusters, e.g. 100-hectare area for tilapia, another 100-hectare cluster for mudfish, and so on;

4) Preservation and protection of wildlife and vegetation resources in a particular place in the enclave, approximately 1,000-hectare cell;

5) Establishment of floating restaurant and health centers; and

6) Optimum utilization of drained Ligawasan areas for agricultural production and other related farm enterprises;

**WHEREAS,** the implementation of the aforementioned components may be one after the other, depending on the availability of funds from the Bangsamoro Autonomous Government and other national and local sources, and from accessible international donor institutions; and

**WHEREAS,** the participants’ support to the proposed comprehensive development program was inspired by the following predetermined thoughts which they collectively drew during the 3-day planning-workshop, to wit:

1) That, the successful implementation of the LEAD program would attract local and foreign tourists to visit the area, thereby boosting our economy;

2) That, the program would promote human resource localization, thereby ensuring occupational justice to the local residents;

3) That, the program would generate sustainable income without sacrificing the environment for the benefits not only of the Ligawasan communities and the region but the country as well; and

4) That, the proposed program would eventually convert the Ligawasan communities into a dynamic and progressive Bangsamoro population center, which would be another milestone achievement of the Bangsamoro legislative and executive bodies.

**NOW THEREFORE,** for and in consideration of the forgoing premises, be it

**RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to appeal the Bangsamoro Government, through the Honorable Ahod “Al-Hadj Murad” B. Ebrahim, Interim Chief Minister, Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to recognize the proposed “Ligawasan Enclave Associative Development (LEAD) program a priority to restore ecological balance along with socioeconomic development of communities in the enclave; and to provide administrative, technical and financial assistance therefor, either directly or indirectly or both.

**ADOPTED:**
