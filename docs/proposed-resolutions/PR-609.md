**RESOLUTION**
**URGING THE BUREAU OF INTERNAL REVENUE TO GRANT CERTIFICATE OF TAX EXEMPTION TO COOPERATIVES REGISTERED WITH THE COOPERATIVES AND SOCIAL ENTERPRISE AUTHORITY (CSEA) OF THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO**

**WHEREAS,** the 1987 Constitution mandates the Congress to “create an agency to promote the viability and growth of cooperatives as instruments for social justice and economic development”;¹

**WHEREAS,** to fulfill this constitutional mandate, Republic Act No. 6939 was enacted to create the Cooperative Development Authority (CDA)² to “promote the viability and growth of cooperatives as instruments of equity, social justice and economic development”³;

**WHEREAS,** Republic Act No. 6938, otherwise known as the “Cooperative Code of the Philippines”, as amended by Republic Act No. 9520, otherwise known as the “Philippine Cooperative Code of 2008”, was also enacted to foster the creation and growth of cooperatives as a practical vehicle for promoting self-reliance and harnessing people power towards the attainment of economic development and social justice;

**WHEREAS,** Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the “Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao,” was enacted to “establish a political entity, provide for its basic structure of government in recognition of the justness and legitimacy of the cause of the Bangsamoro people and the aspirations of Muslim Filipinos and all indigenous cultural communities in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to secure their identity and posterity, allowing for meaningful self-governance within the framework of the Constitution and the national sovereignty as well as territorial integrity of the Republic of the Philippines”⁴;

**WHEREAS,** all “powers, functions and responsibilities not granted by the Constitution or by national law to the Bangsamoro Government shall be vested in the National Government.”⁵ However, “cooperatives and social entrepreneurship” is among powers and authorities expressly granted to the Bangsamoro Government;⁶

**WHEREAS,** the Bangsamoro Government is mandated to “adopt and implement cooperative development policies and programs through the enactment of a Bangsamoro cooperative code”;⁷

**WHEREAS,** Bangsamoro Autonomy Act (BAA) No. 13, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Administrative Code, established the Cooperatives and Social Enterprise Authority (CSEA), “the primary entity to promote the viability and growth of Bangsamoro cooperatives and social enterprise in the Bangsamoro region. It shall be the sole agency of the Bangsamoro Government that registers cooperatives and social enterprises”;⁸

**WHEREAS,** the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament on February 24, 2022 passed Resolution No. 220 or a “Resolution Calling for the Implementation of Section 24 and Section 27, Article XIII of the Bangsamoro Organic Law on the Enactment of a Bangsamoro Cooperative Code and Social Enterprise Code.”

**WHEREAS,** in a meeting of CSEA with officials of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), it was mentioned that there is a need to enact the Bangsamoro Cooperative Code that will grant tax exemption to cooperatives registered under the former;⁹

**WHEREAS,** pending the legislation of the Bangsamoro Cooperative Code, the registration, regulation, and development, including the tax exemption of the cooperatives in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region are covered by the Philippine Cooperative Code of 2008;

**WHEREAS,** the Philippine Cooperative Code of 2008 expressly provide that duly registered cooperatives which do not transact any business with non-members or the general public shall not be subject to any taxes and fees imposed under the internal revenue laws and other tax laws;¹⁰

**WHEREAS,** cooperatives dealing with non-members, “with accumulated reserves and undivided net savings of not more than Ten million pesos (P10,000,000.00) shall be exempt from all national, city, provincial, municipal or barangay taxes of whatever name and nature”;¹¹

**WHEREAS,** the BIR has denied applications for Certificate of Tax Exemption (CTE) from cooperatives registered with CSEA on the grounds that the documents they submitted were certified by CSEA and not by CDA;¹²

**WHEREAS,** the BIR’s denial of CTE applications is based on a strict interpretation of Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 076-10, which is an issuance based on the CDA-BIR ‘Joint Rules and Regulations Implementing Articles 60, 61 and 144 of Republic Act No. 9520, otherwise known as the “Philippine Cooperative Code Of 2008” in relation to Republic Act No. 8424 or the “National Internal Revenue Code, as Amended’.¹³ RMO No. 076-20 requires documents to be certified by the CDA;¹⁴

**WHEREAS,** the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 13 grants the Cooperative Development Division of CSEA the authority to process applications and issue Certificates of Registration and Certificates of Compliance for cooperatives within BARMM;¹⁵

**WHEREAS,** the power to issue certificates necessarily carries with it the power to certify, and CSEA’s certification of documents for cooperatives in BARMM should be considered equivalent to CDA certification for the purposes of CTE applications;¹⁶

**WHEREAS,** the principle of equal protection of the laws establishes that cooperatives in BARMM should not be treated differently from cooperatives in other regions solely based on which government agency they are registered with, as long as they meet the definition of a cooperative under the Philippine Cooperative Code;¹⁷

**WHEREAS,** the Supreme Court has held in Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Arnoldus Carpentry Shop Inc. that “if there is an express mention or if the taxpayer falls within the purview of the exemption by clear legislative intent, the rule on strict construction does not apply”;¹⁸

**WHEREAS,** the tax exemption for cooperatives is expressly provided for in both the Philippine Cooperative Code and the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao¹⁹, demonstrating clear legislative intent;

**WHEREAS,** denying tax exemption to cooperatives registered with CSEA runs counter to the constitutional and legal mandate to promote the viability and growth of cooperatives as instruments for social justice and economic development;

**NOW, THEREFORE,** be it

**RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, to urge the Bureau of Internal Revenue to grant Certificates of Tax Exemption to cooperatives registered with the Cooperatives and Social Enterprise Authority of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, recognizing CSEA certification as equivalent to CDA certification for this purpose;

**RESOLVED FURTHER,** that the Bureau of Internal Revenue be urged to amend Revenue Memorandum Order No. 076-10 to include CSEA-certified documents as acceptable for Certificate of Tax Exemption applications from cooperatives in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**RESOLVED FINALLY,** that copies of this resolution be furnished to the Office of the Chief Minister, the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the Department of Finance, the Cooperative Development Authority, and the Cooperatives and Social Enterprise Authority for their information and appropriate action.

**Adopted,**
