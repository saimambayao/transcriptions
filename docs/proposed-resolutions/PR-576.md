**A RESOLUTION URGING THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT, THROUGH READI-BARMM, TO APPRISE THE BANGSAMORO TRANSITION AUTHORITY OF ITS ACTION PLAN AND PREPAREDNESS MEASURES FOR THE IMPENDING LA NIÑA SEASON AND ITS POTENTIAL CLIMATIC IMPACT**

**WHEREAS**, in September 2020, approximately 55,000 families from the Bangsamoro region endured significant hardship due to torrential rains resulting in heavy floods and widespread damage to homes and livelihoods¹;

**WHEREAS**, in 2022, the Bangsamoro region confronted the onslaught of Tropical Storm Agaton and severe Tropical Storm Paeng, leading to the declaration of a state of calamity, impacting tens of thousands of families and claiming over 50 lives²;

**WHEREAS**, in September 2023, portions of the Special Geographic Area were declared under a state of calamity following massive flooding affecting 27 barangays and approximately 26,000 households³;

**WHEREAS**, amid the prolonged dry spell attributed to the El Niño phenomenon, there is a prevailing concern among National Government authorities regarding the impending onset of La Niña, signaling another extreme weather event that necessitates proactive measures and readiness from local officials in Mindanao, including areas within BARMM⁴;

**WHEREAS**, as of April 2024, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) has officially announced the commencement of a weakening trend in the El Niño phenomenon, with neutral conditions potentially returning in April-May-June 2024;

**WHEREAS**, PAGASA forecasts indicate a growing probability of La Niña development during June-July-August 2024;

**WHEREAS**, meteorological studies and corroborated reports from PAGASA indicate that the effects of La Niña typically manifest in wetter conditions, resulting in more frequent and intense rainfall occurrences, thereby impacting agriculture, water supply, overall weather patterns, and increasing the risk of floods and related disasters;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is particularly vulnerable to flooding during rainy seasons due to its geographical location and topographical features;

**WHEREAS**, the efficient and effective coordination and implementation of disaster mitigation measures are essential to safeguarding the lives and properties of the people residing within the BARMM region;

**WHEREAS**, the Ministry of Interior and Local Government (MILG), operating through the Rapid Emergency Action on Disaster Incidence (READI-BARMM) office, assumes responsibility for implementing disaster preparedness, response, and recovery efforts within the BARMM;

**WHEREAS**, it is imperative for the MILG, through READI-BARMM, to develop a comprehensive action plan to mitigate the impact of possible natural disasters in the upcoming rainy season, with the aim of minimizing the detrimental effects of typhoons and flooding and ensuring the safety and well-being of our residents during times of crisis;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, as it hereby resolved, urges the Ministry Of Interior And Local Government, through READI-BARMM, to apprise the Bangsamoro Transition Authority of its action plan and preparedness measures for the impending La Niña season and its potential climatic impact.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, that the Ministry of Interior and Local Government ensures that the action plan encompasses proactive measures such as early warning systems, evacuation plans, resource allocation, and coordination mechanisms with relevant agencies and stakeholders;

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, that the Ministry of Interior and Local Government provides regular updates and progress reports to the BTA regarding the implementation of the action plan and any adjustments made in response to changing circumstances or emerging threats;

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, that the Ministry of Interior and Local Government collaborates closely with local government units, civil society organizations, and other relevant entities to strengthen community resilience and preparedness against natural disasters;

**FINALLY RESOLVED**, that copies of this resolution be furnished to the Ministry of Interior and Local Government and concerned offices and agencies for their information, compliance, and necessary action.

**ADOPTED,**
