**A RESOLUTION RESPECTFULLY APPEALING TO THE HONORABLE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES TO CERTIFY AS URGENT SENATE BILL NO. 2756, ENTITLED “AN ACT PROVIDING FOR THE CREATION OF A DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS AND HIGHWAYS REGIONAL OFFICE – BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM) AND FIVE (5) NEW DISTRICT ENGINEERING OFFICES (DEOs), APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.”**

**WHEREAS**, Republic Act No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) establishes the framework for genuine autonomy in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), while mandating the continued support and cooperation of the National Government, particularly in areas such as infrastructure and national development programs;

**WHEREAS**, infrastructure is a critical component in promoting inclusive growth, peacebuilding, and disaster resilience in the Bangsamoro region, yet access to quality public infrastructure remains limited, particularly in geographically isolated and conflict-affected areas;

**WHEREAS**, while the Bangsamoro Government, through its Ministry of Public Works (MPW-BARMM), manages infrastructure funded by the regional government, nationally funded infrastructure projects remain under the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), with implementation often coursed through regional offices located outside the Bangsamoro region;

**WHEREAS**, the absence of a dedicated DPWH Regional Office for BARMM may contribute to recurring challenges in the delivery of national infrastructure programs in the region, such as implementation delays, misalignment with regional priorities, inter-agency coordination issues, and difficulty in responding to urgent needs on the ground;

**WHEREAS**, local stakeholders have experienced instances of confusion in implementation responsibilities, particularly where project oversight is split between national agencies and regional ministries, resulting in gaps in service delivery, delayed construction timelines, and difficulties in addressing maintenance and emergency repair needs;

**WHEREAS**, recent disruptions in access caused by ongoing or delayed national infrastructure projects—including bridges and national roads—have shown the need for faster and more responsive coordination between DPWH and BARMM ministries, particularly in times of flooding, disaster, or seasonal road wear;

**WHEREAS**, Senate Bill No. 2756, authored in the Senate, proposes to create a dedicated DPWH Regional Office for BARMM and establish five (5) new District Engineering Offices (DEOs) to ensure the effective and timely delivery of nationally funded infrastructure within the Bangsamoro region;

**WHEREAS**, the establishment of a BARMM-based DPWH Regional Office would strengthen coordination with the MPW-BARMM, improve accountability in project implementation, and ensure that infrastructure programs are sensitive to the region’s unique terrain, security conditions, and development priorities;

**WHEREAS**, the creation of additional DEOs is crucial for expanding engineering and construction services to underserved areas, especially in remote mainland municipalities, the island provinces, and the Special Geographic Area (SGA), which are often excluded from direct DPWH services due to geographic and administrative barriers;

**WHEREAS**, certifying this proposed measure as urgent would affirm the commitment of the National Government to build institutional mechanisms that are responsive to the realities of autonomous governance in BARMM, and accelerate the passage of a law that could transform infrastructure delivery in the region;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the BTA Parliament, to respectfully appeal the President of the Republic of the Philippines to certify as urgent Senate Bill No. 2756, entitled: “*An Act Providing for the Creation of a Department of Public Works and Highways Regional Office–Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) and the Five (5) New District Engineering Offices (DEOs), Appropriating Funds Therefor, and for Other Purposes.*”

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED**, that copies of this Resolution be furnished to the Office of the President, the Senate of the Philippines, the House of Representatives, the Department of Public Works and Highways, the Bangsamoro Chief Minister, and the Ministry of Public Works–BARMM for their appropriate information and action.

**ADOPTED**,

(Sgd.)
