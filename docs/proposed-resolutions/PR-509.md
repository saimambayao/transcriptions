**RESOLUTION CALLING THE PHILIPPINE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT TO ENTRENCH THE BANGSAMORO NARRATIVE IN THE 1987 PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION**

**WHEREAS**, President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Romualdez Marcos, Jr. recently launched the Bagong Pilipinas campaign which calls for a unified Philippines by encouraging the citizens to transcend differences and work harmoniously to shape a better future for Filipinos;

**WHEREAS**, amidst this call for unity, there is an on-going public discussion on the probability of introducing amendments in the 1987 Philippine Constitution;

**WHEREAS**, the President has previously expressed his openness to Charter Change and even informed the public that he has been meeting legal experts to study and probably come up with a reasonable and acceptable version of amendments;

**WHEREAS**, anent the vision of building a Bagong Pilipinas and the discussion of charter change, it becomes imperative that the Bangsamoro narrative be taken into consideration;

**WHEREAS**, the relative peace prevailing in the Bangsamoro has brought stability not only in the region but to the entire country and has generated significant domestic and international confidence;

**WHEREAS**, it is more beneficial to sustain a permanent peace and stability in the Bangsamoro through the entrenchment of the Bangsamoro in the 1987 Constitution which is corrorarily a parallel compliance of the Annex on Transitional Arrangements and Modalities under the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro between the GPH and MILF and Paragraph 16 of the GRP-MNLF-OIC 1976 Tripoli Agreement;

**WHEREAS**, the amendment of the 1987 Constitution has been initiated by then-President Rodrigo R. Duterte through a Constitutional Commission and it is through this initiative that the Expanded Bangsamoro Transition Commission were able to submit proposals on the entrenchment of the Bangsamoro in the 1987 Constitution following the letter and spirit of all signed peace agreements;

**WHEREAS**, while the Duterte Constitutional Commission and the Expanded Bangsamoro Transition Commission are already *functus officio*, the entrenchment of the Bangsamoro in the 1987 Constitution is an indispensable element in preserving the gains from the decades search for peace and stability;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Parliament firmly believes that entrenching the Bangsamoro in the 1987 Philippine Constitution must be included in the current discussion of charter change under the whole-of-government and whole-of-nation approach.

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it –**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Parliament to call the Philippine National Government to entrench the Bangsamoro in the 1987 Philippine Constitution anent the on-going discussion on Charter Change;
