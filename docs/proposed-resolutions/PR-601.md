**WHEREAS,** R.A. No. 9497 entitled "An Act Creating the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines," expressly declares it as a policy of the State to provide safe and efficient air transport and regulatory services in the Philippines by establishing a civil aviation authority with jurisdiction over the restructuring of the civil aviation system, the promotion, development, and regulation of the technical, operational, safety, and aviation security functions under the civil aviation authority;

**WHEREAS,** the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) has issued Memorandum Circular No. 29-15 series of 2015, which outlines rules and guidelines for the operation of UAVs in the Philippines, covering various aspects of drone use, including registration, certification, and operational limitations;

**WHEREAS,** Section 38, Article XIII of R.A. No. 11054 emphasizes the regulatory authority of the Bangsamoro Government over land, sea, and air transportation within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;
