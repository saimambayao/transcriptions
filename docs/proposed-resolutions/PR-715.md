**A RESOLUTION URGING THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MINISTER (OCM) TO CONSTITUTE A TASK FORCE TO IMMEDIATELY ADDRESS THE INADEQUATE WATER SUPPLY SYSTEMS IN RURAL AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM)¹**

**WHEREAS**, Section 9, Article II of the 1987 Philippine Constitution states that the State shall promote a just and dynamic social order that will ensure the prosperity and independence of the nation and free the people from poverty through policies that provide adequate social services, promote full employment, a rising standard of living, and an improved quality of life for all;²

**WHEREAS**, Section 15 of the same Article provides that the State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them;

**WHEREAS**, Republic Act No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), under Section 8, Article IX, mandates the Bangsamoro Government to provide, maintain, and ensure the delivery of basic and responsive health programs, education, livelihood opportunities, housing, power, electricity, and water supply, among others, to the Bangsamoro people and other inhabitants of the Region;³

**WHEREAS**, Section 3, Article V of the BOL mandates the Bangsamoro Government to promote the general welfare, ensure health and safety, support infrastructure development, and improve the quality of life for all its constituents;

**WHEREAS**, the Deputy Executive Director of Mindanao Development Authority (MinDA) Asec. Romeo Montenegro disclosed that despite having vast water resources, the majority of households in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) do not have access to potable water;⁴

**WHEREAS**, in a 2022 Report, published by the Situation of Children Analysis in the Philippines, 97 percent of the population has access to at least basic drinking water services. However, 3 out of 100 individuals, or an estimated 3.3 million, only have restricted or unimproved access to drinking water sources and services;⁵

**WHEREAS**, in the same report, it showed that although the majority of the regions are at over the 90 percent threshold, just 80.2 percent of people in BARMM have access to least minimal access to drinking water, with 2.1 percent still rely primarily on surface water;⁶

**WHEREAS**, while there is an average of 8 out of 10 people with access to basic sanitation services across regions, in BARMM, there are only at most 6 in 10 people having access to the same services;⁷

**WHEREAS**, having access to a clean, potable and safe water is a fundamental right and crucial for the health, sanitation and overall socio-economic growth and development of all communities in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS**, a comprehensive study released by the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) on November 2024 revealed that while 97% of Filipino households have access to basic drinking water, only half of the population has safely managed water services;⁸

**WHEREAS**, in the BARMM, one of the country’s poorest regions, about 20% of households still practice open defecation, presenting considerable public health risks due to environmental contamination and waterborne diseases;⁹

**WHEREAS**, access to potable water shows a clear socio-economic gradient, with only 90% of households in the bottom wealth quintile able to access improved sources compared to almost 100% of the top 20% wealth quintile. About 8% of the poorest 20% lack access to clean drinking water entirely;¹⁰

**WHEREAS**, the said study also revealed that in some municipalities in BARMM and MIMAROPA (Mindoro, Marinduque, Romblon, and Palawan), 10-50% of the total population and children under five still drink surface water, despite its known health risks;¹¹

**WHEREAS**, despite the efforts exerted by the Bangsamoro Government and its concerned agencies to enhance water supply in the region, many rural and underserved communities in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region continue to face difficulty in obtaining access to clean, safe and potable water and to reliable water supply systems;

**WHEREAS**, according to World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, safe water, sanitation and hygiene at home should not be a privilege of only those who are rich or live in urban centers. These are some of the most basic requirements for human health, and all countries have a responsibility to ensure that everyone can access them;¹²

**WHEREAS**, safe drinking water and proper sanitation facilities are essential to health and wellness in the communities. Safe water and sanitation is especially linked to young children’s nutrition and ability to stay healthy and focused in school. Diseases caused by unsafe or unhygienic practices hinder children’s healthy growth and educational success;¹³

**WHEREAS**, studies and reports by the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), UNICEF, and the Mindanao Development Authority (MinDA) have consistently shown that many households in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region continue to lack access to clean, safe, and potable water, especially in rural and geographically isolated areas;

**WHEREAS**, lack of access to potable water severely impacts public health, educational outcomes, and community development, further widening the gap in access to basic services;

**WHEREAS**, various ministries and LGUs hold strategic roles in addressing this issue through infrastructure, health interventions, sanitation, governance, and local coordination;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) Parliament, to urge the Office of the Chief Minister (OCM) to constitute a Task Force to immediately and comprehensively address the inadequate water supply systems in rural and underserved communities in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED**, that the Task Force shall be composed of the following ministries, offices, and agencies, each tasked with the following specific roles:

a) The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) shall lead the planning, design, construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance of water supply infrastructure and facilities;

b) The Ministry of Health (MOH) shall oversee water quality standards, spearhead disease prevention initiatives related to waterborne illnesses, and conduct hygiene and sanitation education programs;

c) The Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education (MBHTE) shall integrate water and sanitation programs in schools and ensure the provision of potable water to support healthy learning environments;

d) The Ministry of the Interior and Local Government (MILG) shall facilitate policy coordination and capacity-building among LGUs to ensure effective local implementation and governance;

e) The Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority (BPDA) shall provide strategic planning, coordination, and monitoring support for the Task Force’s programs, ensure alignment with regional development plans, and coordinate funding and technical assistance; and

f) LGUs shall implement, monitor, and sustain water supply projects at the community level, conduct assessments, and engage community stakeholders.

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED**, that the Task Force shall be mandated to:

1) Conduct a rapid but comprehensive assessment of water supply gaps in the region;

2) Identify and prioritize critical areas in need of immediate intervention;

3) Develop a coordinated multi-sectoral action plan for sustainable water supply development;

4) Secure budgetary support, donor funding, and technical partnerships;

5) Submit regular reports to the Office of the Chief Minister and the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament.

**BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED**, that copies of this Resolution be furnished to the Office of the Chief Minister, the Ministry of Public Works, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education, Ministry of the Interior and Local Government, Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority, and all concerned Local Government Units for their information and appropriate action.
