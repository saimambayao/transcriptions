**WHEREAS**, Section 3, Article XIII of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides that the State shall afford full protection to labor, local and overseas, organized and unorganized, and promote full employment and equality of employment opportunities for all;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro government, in line with its commitment to moral governance, functions with integrity, transparency, and accountability as guiding principles in all its operations;

**WHEREAS**, recognizing the significant efforts undertaken by applicants vying for vacant positions within government offices in BARMM, and to avoid the unwarranted raising of expectations, it is essential they be promptly and appropriately notified of the status of their respective applications;

**WHEREAS**, applicants who are not hired or those who fail to meet the minimum standards set for the position applied for should likewise be informed of their scores and ranks. This will provide them the opportunity to determine ways for improvement;

**WHEREAS**, the Civil Service Commission (CSC) and other relevant oversight bodies emphasize the importance of transparency in the recruitment process for public service positions to ensure fairness and equal opportunity for all applicants;

**WHEREAS**, the recruitment and hiring processes within BARMM have long been the subject of public scrutiny, with numerous concerns raised regarding the perceived fairness, transparency, and integrity of these procedures;

**WHEREAS**, the publication of applicants' names at various stages of the recruitment process — including initial screening, shortlisting, examination, and final selection — can help ensure that the recruitment process remains open and meritocratic, fostering public trust in government hiring practices;

**WHEREAS**, such practice shall deter any form of nepotism, favoritism, or other forms of undue influence, and will promote a culture of integrity and equal opportunity within the Bangsamoro government;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved, that the M/O/As of BARMM are strongly urged to:

1. Publish the names of all applicants at each stage of the recruitment process to ensure transparency.

2. Publish the list through any or all of the following:

    a. Posting in the conspicuous places of their respective offices;
    b. Posting on their official website or any social media platforms; and
    c. Posting through any platform as may be deemed practicable.

3. Make the ratings and assessments of applicants available, upon personal written request to the concerned agency, to foster accountability and allow for public scrutiny of the recruitment process.

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, that the publication of the names shall be in accordance with the provisions of the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173), ensuring that applicants’ personal and sensitive information is protected and that only information relevant to transparency and accountability in the recruitment process be disclosed.

**RESOLVED FINALLY**, that this resolution be disseminated to all relevant M/O/As to promote adherence to these guidelines and uphold the principles of good governance within the Bangsamoro region.
