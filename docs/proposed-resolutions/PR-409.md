**WHEREAS**, among her other accomplishments, Coronel-Ferrer played a pivotal role in formulating the nation’s first Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security. The government adopted the action plan in 2010 as part of its commitment to the UN Security Council Resolution 1325.

**WHEREAS**, Coronel-Ferrer organized numerous peace advocate’s platforms in the country and co-chaired the Non-State Action Working Group of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines.

**WHEREAS**, a former professor in University of the Philippines Diliman, Coronel-Ferrer published articles discussing the governments and politics of Southeast Asia, peace process, civil society and democratization.

**WHEREAS**, Miriam Coronel-Ferrer is undeniably deserving of recognition as an exemplary woman who ardently champions peace-building efforts. She rightfully merits acknowledgment as an outstanding individual whose contributions significantly benefit the public by offering pertinent solutions.

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Parliament – Bangsamoro Transition Authority of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao **A RESOLUTION CONGRATULATING MIRIAM CORONEL – FERRER FOR BEING ONE OF THE LAUREATES OF THE 65TH RAMON MAGSAYSAY AWARDS.**
