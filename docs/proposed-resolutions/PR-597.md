**WHEREAS**, Section 18, Article II of the 1987 Philippine Constitution specifically provides that the State affirms labor as a primary social economic force. It shall protect the rights of workers and promote their welfare;

**WHEREAS**, Article 3 of Presidential Decree No. 442, or The Labor Code of the Philippines, as amended, provides that the State shall afford protection to labor, promote full employment, ensure equal work opportunities regardless of sex, race or creed and regulate the relations between workers and employers. The State shall assure the rights of workers to self-organization, collective bargaining, security of tenure, and just and humane conditions of work;

**WHEREAS**, Section 10, Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall guarantee the fundamental rights of all workers to self-organization, collective bargaining and negotiations, and peaceful concerted activities, including the right to strike, in accordance with the Constitution and the Labor Code of the Philippines;

**WHEREAS**, the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) is the government agency in the Philippines that is mandated to protect and promote the worker's rights and welfare;¹

**WHEREAS**, the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) was established pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 21 and was then attached to DOLE for program and policy coordination pursuant to Republic Act No. 6715, which took effect on November 1, 1989;²

**WHEREAS**, the NLRC is quasi-judicial body that is mandated to promote and maintain industrial peace based on social justice by resolving labor and management disputes involving both local and overseas workers through compulsory arbitration and alternative modes of dispute resolution;³

**WHEREAS**, Article 221 of the same law, as amended, provides that the NLRC shall establish **as many regional branches as there are regional offices** of the DOLE, sub-regional branches or provincial extension units;

**WHEREAS**, pursuant to Article 225 of the same law, as amended, provides that the NLRC shall have the power and authority to promulgate rules and regulations governing the hearing and disposition of cases before it and its regional branches, as well as those pertaining to its internal functions;

**WHEREAS**, Section 3, Article V of the BOL provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare;

**WHEREAS**, pursuant to Section 2, Article VI of the BOL, the National Government - Bangsamoro Government Intergovernmental Relations Body was created to coordinate and resolve issues on governmental relations through regular consultation and continuing negotiation in a non-adversarial manner;

**WHEREAS**, in the BARMM, the regional counterpart of the DOLE is the Ministry of Labor and Employment (MOLE) which shall be the primary policy-making, programming, coordinating and administrative entity of the Bangsamoro Government in the field of labor and employment;⁴

**WHEREAS**, MOLE is further mandated to maintain the industrial peace by promoting harmonious, equitable, and stable employment relations that assures equal protection for the rights of all concerned parties;

**WHEREAS**, in an assessment conducted by International Labour Organization in the year 2022, it was assessed that there has yet to be established a counterpart agency to the NLRC in the BARMM;⁵

**WHEREAS**, disputes that would normally fall under the jurisdiction of the NLRC lack a clear legal remedy (except for the case of Cotabato City);⁶

**WHEREAS**, establishing an NLRC or equivalent agency in the BARMM should be a priority, so a tripartite forum will be available to settle labour disputes;⁷

**WHEREAS**, functions of the NLRC are not devolved to the BARMM when it replaced the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) in 2019;⁸

**WHEREAS**, the NLRC and the Bangsamoro Government forged partnership in handling labor cases in the autonomous region that piled up in past years due to devolution issues.⁹ The NLRC will now accept labor cases emanating from the BARMM;¹⁰

**WHEREAS**, under the MOLE's Labor Dispute Settlement Program, labor conflicts arising from labor and employment undergo through Single Entry Approach or SEnA, an administrative approach, which provides for a speedy, impartial, inexpensive, and accessible settlement procedure of all labor issues or conflicts to prevent them from ripening into full-blown disputes or actual labor cases;¹¹

**WHEREAS**, in a memorandum order dated August 1, 2023, Acting Chairperson Julia Cecily I. Conching-Sosito has instructed the commission's Regional Arbitration Branches in Mindanao to receive and dispose SEnA referrals, complaints, and appeals emanating from the Bangsamoro region;¹²

**WHEREAS**, labor disputes resolutions and the protection of worker's rights are significant elements of good governance and to the economic growth and development of the BARMM;

**WHEREAS**, parties to labor cases in BARMM's three cities and six provinces need to travel to far cities outside the Bangsamoro region where there are NLRC offices that can extend to them legal interventions;¹³

**WHEREAS**, the establishment of an office of NLRC for the BARMM would ensure timely and efficient resolution of labor disputes and assure protection of worker's rights in the Bangsamoro region;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) Parliament to pass and approve this Resolution urging the Government of the Day (GOTD) to include in the agenda of the Intergovernmental Relations Body (IGRB) the establishment of a National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) Office for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region to resolve labor-related cases emanating therein;

**BE IT RESOLVED FURTHER**, that a copy of this Resolution be furnished to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), the Office of the Chief Minister (OCM), and the Ministry of Labor and Employment (MOLE), for information and appropriate action.

Adopted,
