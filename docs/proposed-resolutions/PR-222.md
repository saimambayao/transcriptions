**DIRECTING THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE BANGSAMORO TRANSITION AUTHORITY (BTA) TO DEVISE A MECHANISM THAT WILL TRACK THE COMPLIANCE OF CONCERNED MINISTRIES, OFFICES, AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNITS (LGUs) ON THE BTA-APPROVED LEGISLATIVE MEASURES AND TO REPORT TO THE PARLIAMENT SUCH COMPLIANCE**

**WHEREAS**, Article IV, Section 2 of R.A. No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law provides that “in the exercise of its right to self-governance, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is free to pursue its political, economic, social, and cultural development as provided for in this Organic Law”;

**WHEREAS**, Article V, Section 3 of the same law states that the Bangsamoro Government shall “exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance…”;

**WHEREAS**, Article VII, Section 2 of the same law states that the powers of government are vested in the Parliament which shall exercise those powers and functions expressly granted to it in this Organic Law, and those necessary for, or incidental to the proper governance and development of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. It shall set policies, legislate on matters within its authority…”;

**WHEREAS**, Article VII, Section 3 of the same law states that “the Parliament shall have the authority to enact laws on matters that are within the powers and competencies of the Bangsamoro Government”;

**WHEREAS**, almost three years have passed since the founding of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) and the BTA Parliament;

**WHEREAS**, numerous legislative measures have been approved by the BTA Parliament. According to the BARMM Government’s official website, the BTA Parliament have adopted and approved over 34 bills and 305 resolutions as of January 19, 2023;

**WHEREAS**, there are still hundreds of legislative measures pending the scrutiny and approval of the BTA Parliament;

**WHEREAS**, there is no institutionalized mechanism to track the progress and compliance of concerned entities with such legislative measures; and

**WHEREAS**, given the number of legislative measures and to ensure the implementation of such, a mechanism should be developed to track the compliance of concerned ministries, offices, and LGUs, so as not to let these measures with noble intentions go to waste through only being stuck on paper.

**WHEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED BY THE BTA PARLIAMENT**, to direct the Office of the Secretary General of the BTA to devise a mechanism that will track the compliance of concerned ministries, offices, and LGUs with BTA-approved legislative measures.

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, that the Office of the Secretary General of the BTA be directed to report to the Parliament such compliance by the concerned ministries, offices, and LGUs, through a quarterly report.

Adopted,
