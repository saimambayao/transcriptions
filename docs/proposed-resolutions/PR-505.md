**WHEREAS**, Section 3, Article V of the BOL provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants;

**WHEREAS**, Republic Act No. 10929, also known as the Free Internet Access in Public Places Act, was enacted on August 2, 2017 in order to create a Free Public Internet Access Program that will provide a free access to internet service in public areas throughout the entire country;

**WHEREAS**, the aforementioned bill was enacted in order to promote knowledge-building among citizens and enable them to participate and compete in the evolving information and communication age;

**WHEREAS**, according to the 2020 Census of Population and Housing (CPH) conducted by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), 56.1% of the country's 26.37 million households can access the internet at home. In terms of share to the total number of households in the country, Region IV-A posted the highest number of households having internet access with 19.3 percent share. Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), on the other hand, posted the lowest number of households with internet access at 1.7 percent²;

**WHEREAS**, during the coronavirus pandemic, the Bangsamoro Minister of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education, Mohagher Iqbal, urged the Bangsamoro Government to fully implement R.A. 10929 in the region to help the students cope with crisis brought by the pandemic as only 20 percent of the people in the Bangsamoro region can connect to the internet³;

especially in BARMM have low access to telecom towers, fiber optic cables and free Wi-Fi"⁵;

**WHEREAS**, access to free internet in public places is very indispensable to ensure that all citizens regardless of their socioeconomic background, have equal access to information, education and opportunities;

**WHEREAS**, moreover, this cannot only ensure a better-connected society that allows continuous communication among the citizens, but also most beneficial to the students in their education; and

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, as the interim government of the Bangsamoro Region must examine the implementation of the aforementioned bill in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to identify and address the implementation gaps, issues and challenges that hampered the accomplishment of providing free internet access to the general public in public places.

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the BTA Parliament, to pass and approve this Resolution Requesting the Bangsamoro Government to Intensify the Implementation of Republic Act No. 10929 or the Free Internet Access in the Public Places Act in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.
