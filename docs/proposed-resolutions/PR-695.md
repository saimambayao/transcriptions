**A RESOLUTION**
**URGING THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT TO STRICTLY IMPLEMENT SECTION 4 OF REPUBLIC ACT NO. 9994, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE EXPANDED SENIOR CITIZENS ACT OF 2010, WITHIN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO¹**

**WHEREAS,** Section 4, Article II of the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines states that the primary duty of the Government is to serve and protect the people;

**WHEREAS,** one of the declared policies of the State as provided in the 1987 Constitution is to promote a just and dynamic social order that will ensure the prosperity and independence of the nation and free the people from poverty through policies that provide adequate social services, promote full employment, a rising standard of living and an improved quality of life (Section 9, Article II);

**WHEREAS,** Republic Act No. 9994, also known as the Expanded Senior Citizens Act of 2010, mandates specific benefits and privileges for senior citizens in the Philippines;

**WHEREAS,** Section 4 of R.A. 9994 outlines the privileges for the senior citizens, including but not limited to, discounts on the purchase of goods and services, exemption from the value-added tax (VAT), free medical and dental services, diagnostic and laboratory fees in government facilities, and the provision of express lanes in all commercial and government establishments;

**WHEREAS,** Section 2, Article IV of R.A. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) provides that in the exercise of its right to self-governance, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is free to pursue its political, economic, social and cultural development as provided for in the Organic Law;

**WHEREAS,** Section 3, Article V of the BOL provides for the provision on general welfare, which states that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants;

**WHEREAS,** Section 2(r) of the BOL states that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise its authority over the development programs and laws for women, labor, youth, the elderly, the differently-abled, and indigenous peoples;

**WHEREAS,** in 2020, the PSA reported that Filipinos aged 60 years and older comprised 8.5 percent of the population, or 9.2 million. This figure was double the number of aging citizens in the country in 2000, when the percentage was just 5.9 percent of the national population, or 4.5 million²;

**WHEREAS,** the provisions outlined in R.A. 9994 should legitimately benefit the large number of senior citizens living in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM);

**WHEREAS,** as Bangsamoros', we give our utmost respect to our elderly family members, ensuring that everything is made easier for them and giving due consideration to their needs;

**WHEREAS,** consequently, it is the duty of the Bangsamoro Government to prioritize the elderly by ensuring they receive the necessary government services;

**WHEREAS,** the Bangsamoro Government should act as the guardian of any citizen who needs its protection, with the responsibility to look after the well-being of its people, especially those who are unable to defend or take good care of themselves;

**WHEREAS,** thus, the Bangsamoro Government shall serve as the supreme guardian of the welfare of those who are physically disadvantaged due to their age;

**WHEREAS,** despite the existence of R.A. 9994, reports and observations have indicated that the benefits and privileges for senior citizens under R.A. 9994 are not fully realized in the BARMM region due to various challenges in its implementation and enforcement;

**WHEREAS,** it is imperative for the Bangsamoro Government to conduct a comprehensive public awareness campaign to inform senior citizens and establishments about their rights and privileges under R.A. 9994;

**WHEREAS,** in order to guarantee that Section 4 of R.A. 9994 is implemented correctly and consistently, the Bangsamoro Government shall collaborate with Local Government Units (LGUs) in the Bangsamoro region;

**WHEREAS,** for elderly residents in the Bangsamoro region to receive the respect and assistance they are entitled to, thereby improving their quality of life and general well-being, Section 4 of R.A. 9994 must be strictly enforced;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED,** by the BTA Parliament, to pass and approve this Resolution urging the Bangsamoro Government to strictly implement Section 4 of Republic Act No. 9994, otherwise known as the Expanded Senior Citizens Act of 2010, within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.

**RESOLVED FURTHER,** that a copy of this Resolution be furnished to the Office of the Chief Minister (OCM) for information and appropriate action.

Adopted,
