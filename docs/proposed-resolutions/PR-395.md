**RESOLUTION**

**SUPPORTING THE CALL OF VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS TO CREATE A DEPARTMENT OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC RESOURCES (DFAR)**

**WHEREAS**, Section 9, Article II of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides that the State shall promote a just and dynamic social order that will ensure the prosperity and independence of the nation and free the people from poverty through policies that provide adequate social services, promote full employment, a rising standard of living, and an improved quality of life for all;

**WHEREAS**, Section 7, Article XIII of the Constitution provides that the State shall protect the rights of subsistence fishermen, especially of local communities, to the preferential use of the communal marine and fishing resources, both inland and offshore;

**WHEREAS**, the same provision further mandates the State to also provide support to such fishermen through appropriate technology and research, adequate financial, production, and marketing assistance, and other services;

**WHEREAS**, Section 2 of Republic Act No. 8550, or The Philippine Fisheries Code of 1998, as amended by R.A. No. 10654, provides that it is hereby declared to be the policy of the State to ensure the rational and sustainable development, management and conservation of the fishery and aquatic resources in Philippine waters including the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and in the adjacent high seas, consistent with the primordial objective of maintaining a sound ecological balance, protecting and enhancing the quality of the environment;

**WHEREAS**, the same provision extends that it shall also be a declared policy of the State to adopt the precautionary principle and manage fishery and aquatic resources, in a manner consistent with the concept of ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management and integrated coastal area management in specific natural fishery management areas, appropriately supported by research, technical services and guidance provided by the State;

**WHEREAS**, the Philippines has been regarded as one of the major fish-producing countries of the world given its geographical characteristics¹;

**WHEREAS**, the Philippines is blessed with over 220 million hectares of territorial waters, 18.46 million hectares of continental shelf area and 2.7 million hectares of coral reefs²;

**WHEREAS**, the Philippines hosts about 246,063 hectares of swamplands, 253,854 hectares of fishponds and about 250,000 hectares of other inland resources³;

**WHEREAS**, various industry stakeholders of the fishing industry are calling for the creation of a Department of Fisheries to address the issues plaguing the country’s territorial waters⁴;

**WHEREAS**, a former official of the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) said that a small agency like BFAR is simply not enough to do all tasks of taking care of the EEZ of the country and dealing with international issues as well⁵;

**WHEREAS**, the creation of a Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (DFAR) will allow the government to combat illegal fishing and better manage the country’s marine sources⁶;

**WHEREAS**, former Secretary of the Department of Agriculture (DA), Dr. William Dar⁷, said that by elevating the BFAR into the proposed DFAR that will be independent from the DA, the Philippines will have a centralized agency that will prioritize and support the sustainable development of the country’s fisheries and aquatic resources⁸;

**WHEREAS**, before the COVID-19 pandemic, local fisheries production reached 4.356 million metric tons (MT) in 2018 and 4.415 million MT in 2019, marking a 1.35 percent annual increase⁹;

**WHEREAS**, data from the Philippine Statistics Authority showed that the local fisheries sector had been growing in the low, single-digits for the past few years before recording a slight downturn in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic¹⁰;

**WHEREAS**, production in 2020 dropped by a slight 0.33 percent to 4.4 million MT, before growing again by 3.45 percent in 2021 to 4.248 million MT. However, growth slowed to just 2.2 percent in 2022 to 4.339 million MT¹¹;

**WHEREAS**, data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations shows that the global position of the Philippines in aquaculture production has fallen steadily from 4th place in 1985 to 12th place in 2022, where the Philippines now contributes only a little over one percent (1%) of global farmed fish production compared to five percent (5%) originally¹²;

**WHEREAS**, this downtrend in the country’s production of fisheries and aquatic resources poses a challenge for the State to find more ways on how to sustainably utilize the country’s aquatic resources for economic growth and improved livelihood and employment, while preserving the health of the ocean ecosystem¹³;

**WHEREAS**, fish producers and various stakeholders in the country urge the government to create a department-level agency to oversee the local fisheries industry for it to become globally competitive¹⁴;

**WHEREAS**, agricultural stakeholders are urging the Congress for the early passage of the creation of Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (DFAR)¹⁵;

**WHEREAS**, presently there has been several proposed measures pending at the House of Representatives and Senate for the creation of the DFAR;

**WHEREAS**, creating a department solely dedicated to the needs and concerns of the fisheries and aquatic resources of the country will be a significant step in order to better protect, utilize, maximize, and conserve the nation’s blue economy, as well as uphold the best interest of the fisherfolk¹⁶;

**WHEREAS**, BARMM remains as the top fish producer of the country as of first quarter of 2023¹⁷;

**WHEREAS**, the Department of Agriculture and the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources continue their support to the agricultural and fishery development of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS**, it is important that the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) Parliament, as the interim government of the Bangsamoro Government and is mandated to promote and protect the rights of the constituents of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), to support the call of various stakeholders in the fisheries and aquatic industry to have a separate Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (DFAR) to better address the issues and concerns of the industry.

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the BTA Parliament to pass and approve this Resolution Supporting the Call of Various Stakeholders to Create a Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (DFAR).

Adopted,
