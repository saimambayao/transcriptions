**RESOLUTION URGING THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (DOTr) FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION ON COMPLETING THE RENOVATION OF COTABATO AIRPORT AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR DELAYS**

**WHEREAS**, the Cotabato Airport serves as a vital gateway for transportation and commerce in Cotabato City, the two Maguindanao provinces, and the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao as a whole, thereby connecting the people and businesses to the rest of the country and the world;

**WHEREAS**, according to the Project Physical Status of Report of “Cotabato Expansion of Passenger Terminal Building” posted by the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines, which is under the Department of Transportation (DOTr), the project started on September 29, 2020, and was supposed to be completed on August 1, 2021, and was further moved to December 4, 2021, and yet, even up to this date, it is still far from being completed;

**WHEREAS**, the renovation of the Cotabato Airport, which was planned to improve the facilities and services offered to the traveling public, has been delayed, causing undue inconvenience, potential health hazard, and hindrance to the operation of the airport and to the travel of the public;

**WHEREAS**, it is imperative to hold the contractor accountable for the delays in the renovation project in order to ensure ultimate completion, effective use of public funds, and to prevent similar issues from arising in future projects;

**NOW, THEREFORE**, be it resolved, and it is hereby resolved, that the Department of Transportation (DOTr) is hereby urged to take immediate action to expedite the completion of renovation of the Cotabato Airport and to employ all necessary means to ensure its ultimate completion, such as increasing the number of personnel, equipment, and materials for the renovation works.

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED**, that the DOTr is urged to closely monitor the progress of the renovation works and to take prompt action in case of any further delays, including, but not limited to, imposing financial penalties or termination of contract, to ensure proper use of public funds.

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED**, that the DOTr is urged to ensure that the contractor is held accountable for any additional costs incurred by the delays, and any damages that may have been caused to the airport facilities, and that the contractor is required to take the necessary steps to remedy the delay and make the airport safe, secure, and efficient for the traveling public.

**IT IS HEREBY FINALLY RESOLVED**, that through the proper channel (Intergovernmental Relations Body (IGRB)), copies of this Resolution be furnished the DOTr, the contractor, the airport management, and the media, for their information and guidance, and to make the public aware of the current situation and the actions taken to address it.
