**A RESOLUTION URGING THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND THE SENATE OF THE PHILIPPINES TO RESCHEDULE THE ELECTIONS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION OF MUSLIM MINDANAO TO ALLOW AMPLE TIME TO AMEND THE REGIONAL LAW CREATING PARLIAMENTARY DISTRICTS AND APPORTION THE SEVEN DISTRICT REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE PROVINCE OF SULU TO THE REMAINING TERRITORIES OF THE BARMM**

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) was established following the passage of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), which aimed to provide for a more inclusive governance structure and grant greater autonomy to the Bangsamoro people;

WHEREAS, significant efforts have been made towards the establishment of a parliamentary form of government in the BARMM with the purpose of fostering peace, stability, and development in the region;

WHEREAS, these efforts are embodied under the Bangsamoro Organic Law or Republic Act 11054;

WHEREAS, an indispensable element of the Bangsamoro Organic Law is the provision on parliament representation which are embodied under Section 6 of Article VII of the Bangsamoro Organic Law which specifically provides 80 Parliament Members divided into 32 District Representatives, 40 Party List Representatives and 8 Sectoral Representatives;

WHEREAS, the Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines recognizes the right of the Bangsamoro people to self-determination, and the creation of BARMM has been a landmark step in honoring this right while addressing historical injustices faced by the Bangsamoro communities;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 58 (BAA No. 58) delineates the representation of various districts within the BARMM Parliament to ensure that the diverse voices in the region are adequately represented;

WHEREAS, the recent Supreme Court ruling in the case of Province of Sulu v. Executive Secretary et al.; PHILCONSA v. Senate et al.; and Dimaporo v. COMELEC (G.R. Nos. 242255, 243246, and 243693) confirmed that the Province of Sulu does not fall within the territorial jurisdiction of BARMM, following its rejection of the BOL during the ratification process;

WHEREAS, as a consequence of the Supreme Court's ruling, the representation originally allotted to the Province of Sulu—which comprised seven district representatives—has been rendered ineffective and raises pertinent questions about the appropriate apportionment of district representatives within the BARMM parliamentary framework;

WHEREAS, neglecting to address the fallout of the Supreme Court's decision could lead to the violation of the Bangsamoro Organic Law and the disenfranchisement of stakeholders who seek equitable representation in the BARMM Parliament. Constituents of the Bangsamoro region deserve a legislative assembly that accurately reflects their territories and populations;

WHEREAS, there exists a pressing need to amend BAA No. 58 to clarify the reallocation of district representative roles that were previously assigned to the Province of Sulu, ensuring that the remaining provinces, cities and municipalities within BARMM are properly represented based on updated demography and territorial integrity;

WHEREAS, the conduct of the BARMM Parliamentary Elections, originally scheduled for the 2025 National and Local Election, needs to be rescheduled until such crucial amendments to the BAA and the reapportionment of parliamentary seats are effectively made;

WHEREAS, timely and equitable representation is critical not only for fulfilling the democratic principles enshrined in the Constitution but also for fostering public trust in the newly established regional governance system;

WHEREAS, effective and fair electoral processes are foundational for sustainable governance, and any oversight in this regard could result in a crisis of legitimacy for the BARMM government and its parliamentary members;

WHEREAS, it is the obligation of the legislative and executive branches of government, including the Congress and the President of the Philippines, to facilitate a transparent and lawful process to ensure that the Bangsamoro Organic Law and all laws are complied with.

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED,** that the Bangsamoro Parliament requests the House of Representatives and the Senate of the Philippines to reschedule the election date for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) to provide sufficient time for the reapportionment of parliamentary district representatives and to address the pending legal challenges that affect the functioning and stability of the BARMM;

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED,** that the President of the Philippines be urged to support and advocate for the rescheduling of the election period in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), recognizing the importance of complying with the provision of the law in achieving lasting peace, stability, and development in the Bangsamoro region;

**BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED,** that copies of this resolution be furnished to the President of the Philippines, the House of Representatives, and the Senate of the Philippines, to serve as an expression of the collective will of the people's representatives in the pursuit of a just and lasting peace for the Bangsamoro people.
