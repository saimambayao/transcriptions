WHEREAS, the Ligawasan marsh, a 220,000-hectare intact wetland where a significant number of fauna and flora species are found and confirmed to have natural gas and oil deposits (Flores, 2021¹), is within the combined territorial jurisdiction of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) particularly the two (2) Maguindanao provinces and the Special Geographic Area (SGA), and the provinces of Cotabato and Sultan Kudarat which are part of Region XII or SOCCSKSARGEN;

WHEREAS, the Intergovernmental Energy Board (IEB) which was created in consequential observance of Section 2, Article VI of RA No. 11054, otherwise known as the “Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao”, issued a Circular on the “Joint Award of Petroleum Service Contracts (PSCs) and Coal Operating Contracts (COCs) in the BARMM” on July 6, 2023;

WHEREAS, Section 11, Article XIII of RA No. 11054, grants unto qualified Filipino citizens who are *bona fide* residents of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, with all other conditions being equal, preferential rights over the exploration, development and utilization of natural resources, including uranium and fossil fuels such as petroleum, natural gas, and coal within the territorial jurisdiction of the Bangsamoro;

WHEREAS, the territorial jurisdiction of the Bangsamoro region and the SOCCSKSARGEN cluster in the Ligawasan enclaves is not yet technically and officially determined and established;

WHEREAS, the determination and establishment of the geographic boundaries of the Ligawasan marsh within the territories of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is generally indispensable in order to properly protect its interest concerning the natural wealth of the region;

WHEREAS, the urgency of determining and establishing these boundaries is also of paramount necessity considering the exigency especially of plying applicants for exploration, development and utilization of the natural resources inside and outside the BARMM;

WHEREAS, to obtain the documents on these boundaries is a consequential compliance to the laws and other agreements related to the exploration, development and utilization of Ligawasan enclave’s natural resources.

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Parliament, to encourage the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources and Energy (MENRE) to exigently determine and establish the boundaries of the Ligawasan marsh within the spatial area of jurisdictional authority of the Bangsamoro regional government in coordination with the local governments of the neighboring provinces of Cotabato and Sultan Kudarat which also occupy minor portions of the marsh, for the best interest of the Bangsamoro region without jeopardy to the two provinces mentioned.
