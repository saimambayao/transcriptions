**WHEREAS**, currently, there are no universities within the Bangsamoro Region offering a degree in special education; in fact, most universities in the country that offer this degree are private schools, which means the cost is usually high;

**WHEREAS**, there is a necessity for special education teachers in the Bangsamoro Region;

**WHEREAS**, with the lack of resources for Bangsamoro teachers to further their knowledge in the field of special education, the Bangsamoro Government should look for ways to fill the void;

**WHEREAS**, the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education (MBHTE) shall be primarily responsible for the formulation, planning, implementation, and coordination of the policies, plans, programs, and projects in the areas of formal and non-formal education at all levels, supervise all educational institutions, both public and private, and provide and integrated system of education relevant and responsive to the needs, ideals, and aspirations of the Bangsamoro People;

**WHEREAS**, incorporating courses covering basic knowledge in special education will enhance the quality of education in the Bangsamoro Region and will contribute to the goal of inclusive education;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Parliament of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to ENCOURAGE THE MINISTRY OF BASIC, HIGHER, AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION - TECHNICAL EDUCATION SKILLS AND DEVELOPMENT (MBHTE-TESD) TO INCLUDE PROGRAMS OR COURSES THAT COVER SKILLS FOR TEACHING LEARNERS WITH DISABILITIES.
