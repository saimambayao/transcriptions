**A RESOLUTION URGING THE MINISTRY OF BASIC, HIGHER, AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION (MBHTE) TO REQUIRE THE MANDATORY POSTING OF NOTICES FOR GOVERNMENT-FUNDED EDUCATION SCHOLARSHIPS IN DESIGNATED CONSPICUOUS AREAS OF ALL ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS WITHIN THE REGION**

WHEREAS, Section 1, Article XIV of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides:

“**Section 1.** The State shall protect and promote the right of all citizens to quality education at all levels, and shall take appropriate steps to make such education accessible to all;”

WHEREAS, in symmetry therewith, Section 8 of the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 18, otherwise known as “The Bangsamoro Education Code of 2021,” declares that:

“**Section 8.** The Bangsamoro Government shall promote and protect the constitutional right of all to quality and accessible education at all levels and to establish, maintain, and support a complete, adequate, and integrated system of education relevant and responsive to the needs, ideals, and aspirations of the Bangsamoro People... xxx;”

WHEREAS, among the principles observed by the Bangsamoro Education Code, as provided under **Section 9** thereof, are INCLUSIVITY and EQUITY, emphasizing that everyone shall have access to quality education regardless of beliefs, cultures, ethnicities, genders, needs, abilities, and socio-economic backgrounds and that those who have less in life shall have more in educational services and opportunities;

WHEREAS, government-funded education scholarships serve to support and enhance the educational opportunities of eligible students by mitigating financial barriers;

WHEREAS, it has been observed that information about government-funded education scholarships is not always effectively disseminated to all potential beneficiaries, making students unaware of available funding opportunities;

WHEREAS, most of the time, information relevant to government-funded education is disseminated through social media platforms. As such, many potential beneficiaries, especially those living in far-flung areas where there is a lack of or complete absence of internet access, are often deprived of such information;

WHEREAS, it is the mandate of the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education (MBHTE) to formulate, plan, implement, and coordinate policies, plans, programs, and projects in the areas of formal and non-formal education at all levels, to supervise all educational institutions, both public and private, and to provide for the establishment, maintenance, and support of a complete, adequate, and integrated system of education relevant and responsive to the needs, ideals, and aspirations of the Bangsamoro People;

WHEREAS, enshrined under **Section 14** of the Bangsamoro Education Code, the Minister shall be vested with the power to promulgate rules and resolutions necessary to carry out the Ministry’s objectives, policies, functions, plans, programs, and projects;

WHEREAS, there is a need to establish a formalized process to guarantee that information about government-funded education scholarships is consistently and visibly communicated to students within postsecondary educational institutions;

WHEREAS, it is well within MBHTE’s objectives and their tagline, “Bangsamoro United: Education Without Exception,” to make certain that scholarships are awarded to their respective target beneficiaries by ensuring that the latter are informed of the scholarship programs being implemented;

WHEREAS, effective dissemination of information regarding these scholarships is crucial to making certain that all potential beneficiaries are aware of and can access such opportunities;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Parliament of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to **URGE THE MINISTRY OF BASIC, HIGHER, AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION (MBHTE) TO REQUIRE THE MANDATORY POSTING OF NOTICES FOR GOVERNMENT-FUNDED EDUCATION SCHOLARSHIPS IN DESIGNATED CONSPICUOUS AREAS OF ALL ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS WITHIN THE REGION.**
