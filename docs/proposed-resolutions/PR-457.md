**WHEREAS**, the TJRC presented its report on March 15, 2016 in Cotabato City and on March 16, 2016 in Manila, containing a list of recommendations directed towards a national healing process from the decades-long armed conflict in Mindanao and addressing deep-rooted prejudices between our peoples;

**WHEREAS**, despite recent progress in the implementation of the CAB, delays and challenges persist in the realization of transitional justice within and outside the BARMM;

**WHEREAS**, it has been seven (7) years since the TJRC report was published, and neither the recommendations for a TJRP nor the creation of the NTJRCB have been realized, which could greatly affect the undertaking of an exit agreement under the CAB;

**WHEREAS**, the creation of the NTJRCB shall serve as a platform for the victims and its TJRP as a mechanism to seek redress for the legitimate grievances, historical injustices, human rights violations, to guarantee the non-recurrence of past injustices, and finally, for healing and reconciliation, a necessary step towards the comprehensive implementation of transitional justice measures;

**WHEREAS**, the National Government, carries the mandate to enact mechanisms that promote justice, peace, and development in all territories of the Philippines, making the support of the President and the Philippine Congress invaluable and indispensable in establishing a TJRP and the creation of NTJRCB;

**WHEREAS**, the implementation of the TJRP and the creation of NTJRCB are vital to the advancement of the peace and development framework in Mindanao of the Philippine Government;

**WHEREAS**, the legislators that introduced bills on the establishment of a TJRP and the creation of the NTJRCB for the purpose, include: 1) Representative Jose Christopher Belmonte, who filed House Bill (HB) No. 5669 in the 17th Congress; 2) Former Anak Mindanao Representative Amihilda J. Sangcopan, who joined Representative Jose Christopher Belmonte in filing HB No. 4003 in the 18th Congress; 3) Representatives Ziaur-Rahman “Zia” Alonto Adiong and Yasser Alonto Balindong, who filed HB No. 2975 in the 19th Congress; 4) Representative Mujiv S.

**WHEREAS**, the BTA Parliament and the Bangsamoro people are immensely grateful to the aforementioned former and incumbent members of Congress who have devoted their time, expertise, and resources in advocating for the creation of the NTJRCB, which is crucial in furthering the cause for peace, justice, and reconciliation in the Bangsamoro, and ultimately for the completion of the CAB;

**WHEREAS**, the path towards healing and reconciliation is a long and arduous one which necessitates a nation’s commitment, collective action, and deep-rooted understanding for the cause against injustices and tyranny;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED, as it is hereby resolved** by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) Parliament, to respectfully urge his Excellency, President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, Jr., and the leadership of both Houses of Philippines Congress, to prioritize the creation of the National Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Commission for the Bangsamoro.
