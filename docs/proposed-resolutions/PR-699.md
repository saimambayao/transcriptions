**A RESOLUTION**
**URGING THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MINISTER (OCM) TO PROVIDE FULL FUNDING SUPPORT FOR AVIATION OR PILOT TRAINING TO QUALIFIED AND DESERVING BANGSAMORO YOUTH**

**WHEREAS,** Section 2, Article IV of BOL states that in the exercise of its right to self-governance, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is free to pursue its political, economic, social, and cultural development as provided for in this Organic Law;

**WHEREAS,** Section 3, Article V the BOL provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants;

**WHEREAS,** Section 2, Article VII of the BOL states that the powers of government shall be vested in the Parliament which shall exercise those powers and functions expressly granted to it in this Organic Law, and those necessary for, or incidental to the proper governance and development of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. It shall set policies, legislate on matters within its authority, and elect a Chief Minister who shall exercise executive authority on its behalf;

**WHEREAS,** Section 13, Article IX of the BOL provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall recognize the vital role of the youth in nation-building, promote and protect their physical, moral, spiritual, and nationalism, encourage involvement in public and civic affairs, and promote mental and physical fitness through sports;

**WHEREAS,** Section 20 of the same article provides that the Bangsamoro educational system shall encourage and supports programs, league competitions, indigenous games, martial arts, and amateur sports including training for regional, national, and international competitions;

**WHEREAS,** Section 13, Article IX of the BOL states that the Bangsamoro Government shall provide, maintain, and ensure the delivery of basic and responsive health programs, quality education, appropriate services, livelihood opportunities, affordable and progressive housing projects, power and electricity, and water inhabitants of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS,** Section 8, Chapter 2 of Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 18 or the Bangsamoro Education Code provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall promote and protect the constitutional right of all to quality education and accessible education at all levels and to establish and maintain a complete, adequate, and integrated system of education relevant and responsive to the needs, ideals, and aspirations of the Bangsamoro people;

**WHEREAS,** the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is a newly created region that is still in the process of setting up a government suitable to the systems of life, needs, and aspirations of the Bangsamoro people;

**WHEREAS,** many young Bangsamoro individuals are interested in pursuing careers as pilots or in the aviation industry but are hindered by financial constraints;

**WHEREAS,** government funding for qualified and deserving Bangsamoro youth can contribute to the development of a skilled and competent pool of pilots, which is necessary for maintaining and ensuring the safety of air travel;

**WHEREAS,** moreover, allocating government funding can help prospective pilots and their families reduce the financial burden of pilot training, which is costly;

**WHEREAS,** this funding can also promote access to training for all qualified Bangsamoro youth, thereby ensuring that skilled individuals—regardless of their socioeconomic background—can pursue their aspirations and dreams of becoming pilots;

**WHEREAS,** in addition, this would enhance diversity within the profession;

**WHEREAS,** providing young people with access to pilot training can help the Bangsamoro region develop and create a pool of skilled pilots who are indispensable to safeguarding emergency services and civilian air traffic control, both of which are necessary for maintaining the stability of the region;

**WHEREAS,** the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA), as the interim government of the Bangsamoro region, has the mandate to create opportunities that will facilitate growth and full employment for the Bangsamoro constituents;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED,** by the BTA Parliament, to pass and approve this Resolution urging the Office of the Chief Minister to provide full funding support for aviation or pilot training to qualified and deserving Bangsamoro youth.

Adopted,
