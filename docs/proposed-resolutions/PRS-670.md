**RESOLUTION**

**REQUESTING THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY OF THE BANGSAMORO PARLIAMENT TO CONDUCT A LEGISLATIVE INQUIRY INTO THE ALLEGED ABDUCTIONS INVOLVING WHITE VANS IN COTABATO CITY AND OTHER AREAS WITHIN THE BANGSAMORO REGION**

**WHEREAS**, Section 5, Article II of the 1987 Constitution declares that the maintenance of peace and order, the protection of life, liberty, and property, and the promotion of general welfare are essential for the enjoyment by all people of the blessings of democracy;

**WHEREAS**, Section 3, Article V of Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law, provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the powers expressly granted to it, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance, and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other rights, the preservation and enrichment of culture, as well as the promotion of health and safety;

**WHEREAS**, reports have been circulating in Cotabato City and other areas within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) about a white van allegedly involved in abductions, causing widespread concern among the public¹;

**WHEREAS**, a man reported being abducted and later abandoned in Datu Saudi Ampatuan, Maguindanao del Sur. On January 17, 2025, while in Midsayap, Cotabato , he was forcibly taken, blindfolded, and bound by suspects, who shoved him into a white van, leaving him unaware of his destination²;

**WHEREAS**, the individual further revealed that the suspects allegedly intended to remove his kidney; however, the plan was reportedly aborted when the suspects discovered that he was suffering from an illness³;

**WHEREAS**, according to the Ministry of Social Services and Development (MSSD), most human trafficking cases in the region involve illegal recruitment, syndicated mendicancy, debt bondage, organ trafficking, and forced labor⁴;

**WHEREAS**, Commercial white van drivers, especially those traveling to and from Cotabato City, are experiencing significant disruptions, as passengers now fear that any white van may be linked to the abduction rumors⁵;

**WHEREAS**, certain white vans operating along the Cotabato City to General Santos City route, and vice versa, have displayed signs on their vehicles stating, "Hindi ako nangunguha ng tao" (I am not abducting people), seemingly in response to concerns about abductions and suspicion surrounding their operations⁶;

**WHEREAS**, these alleged abductions have instilled fear and anxiety within communities, particularly among parents and guardians, regarding the safety and security of their children and loved ones;

**WHEREAS**, the Committee on Public Order and Safety of the Bangsamoro Parliament is responsible for overseeing matters related to maintaining public safety, order, and security within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM);

**WHEREAS**, the occurrence of such incidents, if proven true, threatens the safety of vulnerable members of society and calls for an immediate and thorough investigation to protect the welfare of children and the general public;

**WHEREAS**, there is a need to investigate the veracity of these allegations, identify the individuals or groups behind such acts, and determine whether there are systemic issues contributing to this alarming trend of abductions;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, by the Bangsamoro Parliament, to request the Committee on Public Order and Safety to conduct a legislative inquiry into the reported incidents of abductions involving a white van in Cotabato City and other areas within BARMM, to determine the facts surrounding the allegations of abductions, assess the overall security situation in the affected areas, and recommend necessary legislative and security measures to prevent further abductions and ensure the protection of vulnerable sectors, especially children.

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED**, that the Committee on Public Order and Safety shall submit a report on the findings of the inquiry, including recommended actions, to the Bangsamoro Parliament and the general public.

**RESOLVED, FINALLY**, that copies of this Resolution be furnished to the Committee on Public Order and Safety and other relevant stakeholders for their information and swift necessary action.

**ADOPTED**,
