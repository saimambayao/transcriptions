**WHEREAS,** if this setup is continuously left unattended by the Judicial and Bar Council, it can further result to more aggravated conflict between litigating parties, since the injured party with little hope for case resolution may resort to extra-judicial means to satisfy their respective claims and will inevitably transpire and conceive more complicated and or complex situations;

**WHEREAS,** as the interim government of the Bangsamoro Government, it is imperative for the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) Parliament to guarantee to every Bangsamoro or Muslim Filipino the enjoyment of his/her constitutional rights as enshrined by the Constitution and other pertinent laws;
