Introduced by: **MP Abdullah E. Gayak, MP Eddie M. Alih & MP Romeo K. Sema**

**A RESOLUTION URGING THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT TO ESTABLISH A WIND POWER FARM PROJECT**

**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Paragraph A of Republic Act 9513 otherwise known as "An Act Promoting the Development, Utilization and Commercialization of Renewable Energy Resources and for Other Purposes or the Renewable Energy Act of 2008" states:

> **Section 2.** Declaration of Policies. – *It is hereby declared the policy of the State to:*
> (a) Accelerate the exploration and development of renewable energy resources such as, but not limited to, biomass, solar, wind, hydro, geothermal and ocean energy sources, including hybrid systems, to achieve energy self-reliance, through the adoption of sustainable energy development strategies to reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels and thereby minimize the country's exposure to price fluctuations in the international markets, the effects of which spiral down to almost all sectors of the economy.

**WHEREAS**, Article XIII, Section 36 of R.A. 11054 otherwise known as "Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao" (*OLBARMM for brevity*) states:

> **Section 36.** Energy and Power Generation. - *The Bangsamoro Government shall promote investments in the energy and power generation sector, domestic and international, public and private, in the power sector industry in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region: Provided, that is shall as practicable, promote low carbon sustainable power generation policies provided in the Organic Law: Provided, further, That the Bangsamoro Government shall notify the National Government insofar as power generation investments are concerned.*

**WHEREAS**, inadequate baseload capacity and unbalanced generation capacity mix led to electric crisis in Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS**, while the electricity demand in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is growing fast, the supply of electricity is often short of demand and the discrepancy in electrification rate between cities and rural areas;

**WHEREAS**, the wind power farm project will promote energy self-reliance and reduce the country's dependence on imported fossil fuels for power generation;

**WHEREAS**, wind turbines are helping the country diversify its energy sources beyond fossil fuels and generating not only power, but jobs, revenue and interest among thousands of curious tourists;

**WHEREAS**, wind turbines do not release emissions that can pollute the air or water (with rare exceptions), and they do not require water for cooling; wind turbines may also reduce the amount of electricity generation from fossil fuels, which results in lower total air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions; and

**WHEREAS**, windmills are very important since they provide a way to produce electricity without causing pollution, which is a healthier option for us and for the earth. Wind power is also a renewable resource. This means that it will continue to be available on Earth since wind is constantly produced;

**NOW THEREFORE, be it;**

**RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to urge the Bangsamoro government to establish a wind power farm project.
