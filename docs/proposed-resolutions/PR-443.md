**BTA PARLIAMENT**
Second Regular Session

**Proposed Resolution No. 443**

Authored by Deputy Speaker Atty. Omar Yasser C. Sema

**RESOLUTION**
**EQUALLY CONDEMNING THE CONTINUING ACTS OF VIOLENCE COMMITTED BY ISRAEL AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF PALESTINE AND BY HAMAS MILITANT GROUP AGAINST THE CIVILIANS OF ISRAEL**

**WHEREAS**, the long-standing Israel-Palestine dispute once again shocked the world as Israel intensify airstrikes over Gaza in retaliation to a surprise attack by Hamas militant group last October 07, 2023 in various parts of Israel;

**WHEREAS**, in escalating its retaliation, thousands have been killed by continuous airstrikes and bombardment by Israeli Defense Force and it includes women, elderly and children and it blocked entry of basic human needs in the City of Gaza such as food, water and medicine. As of October 16, 2023, water supply in United Nations shelters already ran out. Power and internet outages are also implemented against Gaza, thereby depriving the people therein access to timely information;

**WHEREAS**, in October 13, 2023, Israel orders 1.1 million residents of Northern Gaza to evacuate South as they prepare to advance a ground attack therein;

**WHEREAS**, the means employed by Israel to retaliate with the Hamas militant group is to the detriment of civilians, including men and women, patients in the hospitals, the old, the infant, and the unborn who are clearly deprived of the basic human rights.

**NOW, THEREFORE**, be it

**RESOLVED** by the BTA Parliament, as it hereby resolves, to equally condemn the continuing acts of violence committed by Israel against the people of Palestine and by Hamas Militant Group against civilians of Israel;

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, to call for the Israeli Government to allow the entry of humanitarian assistance in the City of Gaza to address the people’s immediate needs;

**RESOLVED FURTHERMORE**, to call for the Hamas Militant Group to abide by International Humanitarian Law in the pursuit of their aspiration for the people of Palestine;

**RESOLVED FINALLY**, that a copy of this resolution be furnished before the Office of the Israel Embassy to the Philippines and Palestine Embassy to the Philippines.

**ADOPTED**,
