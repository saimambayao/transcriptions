The Bangsamoro Transition Authority may also enact a Bangsamoro Civil Service Code, as provided in this Organic Law, subject to the Constitutional mandate of the Civil Service Commission.

The Bangsamoro Transition Authority shall enact law to recognize, protect, promote, and preserve the rights of indigenous peoples in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. Until the law enacted, subsisting regional laws on the indigenous peoples in the Bangsamoro shall be operational.

This also includes the setting up of office and other institutions necessary for the continued functioning of government and delivery of social services in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, as well as those necessary for the smooth operations of the first elected Bangsamoro Government in 2022.

WHEREAS, the BTA, as the interim government of BARMM, plays a crucial role and has been an instrument for ensuring an inclusive, beneficial, transparent, and effective transition process, as well as the smooth implementation of the provisions of the BOL before the end of the transition period;

WHEREAS, to date, the BTA Parliament has passed the Bangsamoro Administrative Code (October 28, 2020), the Bangsamoro Civil Service Code (February 24, 2021), the Bangsamoro Education Code (May 18, 2021), the Bangsamoro Electoral Code (March 9, 2023), and the Bangsamoro Local Governance Code (September 28, 2023), demonstrating its commitment to fulfilling its legislative mandate during the transition period, and has organized its regional bureaucracy accordingly;

WHEREAS, in the recent ruling of the Supreme Court in the case *Province of Sulu, et. al. v. Medialdea, et. al.*, G.R. Nos. 242255, 243246, and 243693, promulgated on September 9, 2024, it has upheld the validity of Republic Act No. 11054 or the BOL but declared the Province of Sulu as not part of the BARMM after the province rejected the law's ratification⁹;

WHEREAS, the exclusion of the province of Sulu from BARMM, following the Supreme Court ruling, has created uncertainties in the provisions of already enacted Bangsamoro Autonomy Acts by the BTA, leading to ambiguity in crucial aspects of the upcoming BARMM parliamentary elections, such as the composition of the Bangsamoro Parliament, the allocation of parliamentary district seats, and the rights to vote and to be elected, including representation, among others;

WHEREAS, in an interview on September 16, 2024, Ray Sumalipao, Director of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) for BARMM, stated that the BTA must decide the fate of the seven parliamentary seats previously reserved for the province of Sulu;¹⁰

WHEREAS, lawyer and human rights advocate Algamar Latiph, through his counsel, has filed a motion for reconsideration before the Supreme Court on its decision to exclude Sulu province from the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao¹¹;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 35, also known as the Bangsamoro Electoral Code of 2023 was signed into law last March 8, 2023;

WHEREAS, a petition is currently pending before the Supreme Court under G.R. No. 267368, challenging the Bangsamoro Electoral Code of 2023, which governs the electoral system within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region¹²;

WHEREAS, the Supreme Court requires sufficient time to thoroughly review and deliberate on the petition challenging the Bangsamoro Electoral Code and the motion for reconsideration submitted in connection with the Sulu case;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Electoral Code represents a novel, distinct, and complex piece of legislation, given its application within an autonomous regional parliamentary framework operating under a national presidential system;

WHEREAS, as of 02 July 2024, 16 several political parties and 1,500 sectoral organizations have sought registration with the COMELEC following the enactment of the Bangsamoro Electoral Code in March 2023¹³;

WHEREAS, as of 02 October 2024, out of 16 political parties, only three (3) have been accredited by the COMELEC, namely: 1) UBJP (United Bangsamoro Justice Party), 2) Al Ittihad UKB, and 3) BGC (BARMM Grand Coalition)¹⁴;

WHEREAS, given the unique, complex, and novel nature of the Bangsamoro Electoral Code, along with the systems and processes it entails, the COMELEC requires additional time to adequately prepare for the Parliamentary elections, in addition to the national and local elections;

WHEREAS, a recent survey conducted by the Institute for Autonomy and Governance (IAG) highlights the significant challenges and limited understanding among the Bangsamoro electorate regarding the upcoming parliamentary elections, with the majority of likely voters across the autonomous region indicating they have little to no knowledge of the new voting system and the unique features of the region's first-ever parliamentary elections in 2025¹⁵;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro electorate must be given adequate time and opportunity to familiarize themselves with and fully comprehend the new parliamentary elections within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

WHEREAS, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the economic performance of the BARMM surged by 4.3 percent in 2023, reflecting an estimated P11.9 billion increase in the region's Gross Domestic Product (GDP)¹⁶;

WHEREAS, recent data from the PSA reveals that, despite having the highest poverty incidence in Mindanao, BARMM achieved an almost 30 percent poverty incidence reduction rate, from 52.6 percent in 2018 to 23.5 percent in 2023¹⁷. This improvement can be attributed to the initiatives of the Bangsamoro Government and the collaborative efforts of stakeholders in promoting peace and development in the region;

WHEREAS, the transition period plays a crucial role in ensuring the smooth establishment of BARMM as an autonomous political entity, with enhanced self-governance and jurisdiction over the Bangsamoro region, free from legal impediments;

WHEREAS, it is imperative to ensure that political parties, duty bearers, and the Bangsamoro electorate are prepared for the first regular Parliamentary elections;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED,** by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) Parliament to pass and approve this Resolution respectfully requesting the House of Representatives and the Senate of the Philippines to further extend the conduct of the first regular Parliamentary elections in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region to allow sufficient time to resolve legal issues affecting the Parliamentary elections, ensure broader participation of political parties and a full understanding by the Bangsamoro electorate of the new Parliamentary elections, and enable the Bangsamoro Government to sustain the momentum of socio-economic progress in the region.

**BE IT RESOLVED FURTHER,** that a copy of this Resolution be forwarded to the House of Representatives and the Senate of the Philippines for information and appropriate action.

Adopted,

(Sgd.)
