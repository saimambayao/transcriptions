**RESOLUTION ENCOURAGING THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNITS IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT (MILG) AND MINISTRY OF BASIC, HIGHER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION (MBHTE) TO EXTEND SUPPORT, MONITOR, AND MAINTAIN A DATABASE OF MADARIS, ARABIC TEACHERS, AND ISLAMIC SCHOLARS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN ORDER TO PROMOTE A BALANCED EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE BANGSAMORO CHILDREN AND YOUTH**

**WHEREAS**, Section 17 Article II of the 1987 Philippine Constitution states that the State shall give priority to education, science and technology, arts, culture, and sports to foster patriotism and nationalism, accelerate social progress, and promote total human liberation and development;

**WHEREAS**, Section 16 Article IX of Republic Act (R.A.) 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) states, in part, that it shall be a top priority of the Bangsamoro Government to establish, maintain, and support a complete and integrated system of quality education, which shall be a subsystem of the national education system. The Bangsamoro Government shall develop an educational framework relevant and responsive to the needs, ideals, and aspirations of the Bangsamoro people;

**WHEREAS**, Section 18 Article IX of R.A. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) provides, in part, that the Bangsamoro Government shall establish, maintain, and supervise *Madaris* education in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. The Parliament shall enact legislation to develop and strengthen the *Madaris* educational system in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS**, in the Philippines, the *Madaris* education is considered as the oldest in Mindanao and is recognized to be the single most important factor in the preservation of the Islamic faith in the Philippines¹;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Government envisions to have a balanced and quality education for all the areas under the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region as mandated by R.A. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL). Having a balanced education means that the next generation of youth completely understand the Arabic and English languages;

**WHEREAS**, traditional *Madaris* are the most important educational institutions in Muslim Mindanao since they are looked up to not only as schools of learning but also as symbols of Islam. For the Moro people, they are the proper place to learn Islamic teachings and study the Arabic language. However, many of them have no permit to operate, while also lacking recognition of the government or any accrediting body in the Philippines²;

**WHEREAS**, the weakness of the traditional *Madaris* have become a major concern in recent years, especially of the national, regional, and local government, the community, and of the *Madaris* themselves. These *Madaris* have been operating on a meager budget, relying mostly on local and limited foreign donations³;

**WHEREAS**, issues and challenges confronting the *Madaris* education translate to low remuneration for teachers, lack of basic facilities and instructional materials, and the problems of competence and adequacy of the curriculum used in most *Madaris*. Another challenge confronting *Madaris* education is their need to obtain government recognition in order for them to officially receive support to be able to offer quality education and to ensure their continuing academic growth⁴;

**WHEREAS**, the challenges of traditional *Madrasah* in terms of funding and budget is generally perceived as a serious challenge, it shows that *Madaris* institutions in the BARMM are financially inadequate. This is attributed to the fact that *Madaris* in the BARMM are self-sustained, with little or no support coming from the government. Moreover, the government should recognize them as educational institutions and provide them financial assistance to improve their facilities, instructional materials and supplies⁵;

**WHEREAS**, there is a need for both the Local Government Units (LGUs) as well as the Bangsamoro Government through the Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education (MBHTE) and Ministry of Interior and Local Government (MILG) to create a system where registrations of these *Madaris* can transmit their records and enrolment and exit data to appropriate agencies;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED** by the BTA Parliament, to pass and approve this Resolution encouraging the Local Government Units (LGUs) in close coordination with the Ministry of Interior and Local Government (MILG) and Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education (MBHTE) to extend support, monitor and maintain a database of *Madaris*, Arabic teachers, and Islamic scholars in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in order to promote a balanced educational development of the Bangsamoro children and youth.

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, that copy of this Resolution be furnished to the MILG and MBHTE, for information and appropriate action.

Adopted,

**ENGR. BAINTAN ADIL-AMPATUAN, MNSA**
