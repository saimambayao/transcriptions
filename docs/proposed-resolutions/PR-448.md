**A RESOLUTION URGING ALL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES WITHIN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION TO OBTAIN DRIVER’S LICENSE AND/OR RENEW THEIR MOTOR VEHICLE REGISTRATION WITH THE BANGSAMORO LAND TRANSPORTATION OFFICE (BLTO)**

**WHEREAS**, Section 38, Article XIII of Republic Act No. 11054 otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law vested to the Bangsamoro Government the authority to grant regional franchises, licenses, and permits to land, sea, and air transportation plying routes in the provinces or cities within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. More specifically, RA 11054 also conferred to the Bangsamoro Government the authority over the following:

   a) Regulation of the transportation in the Zones of Joint Cooperation, subject to the provision in Section 19 of this Article;

   b) Registration of land, water, and air transportation operating exclusively within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region; and

   c) Exercise of quasi-judicial powers over the operation of land and water transportation in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in accordance with the rules of procedure established by the Parliament;

**WHEREAS**, Section 1, Article III of RA 11054 also provides that BARMM shall always be an integral, indivisible, and inseparable part of the national territory of the Republic of the Philippines;

**WHEREAS**, under the Bangsamoro Administrative Code, the Bangsamoro Land Transportation Office (BLTO) is one of the sectoral offices of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC).

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Admnistrative Code provides that the Bangsamoro Government is committed to the promotion, maintenance and expansion of viable, efficient, fast, safe and dependable transportation systems as effective instrument for regional development and economic progress.

**WHEREAS**, Pursuant to the above-mentioned laws, the Land Transportation Office (LTO) turned over all its functions, assets and properties within the areas of the Bangsamoro region to the BLTO;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Land Transportation Office (BLTO) has the authority, among others, to issue driver’s license and register motor vehicles within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS**, after the turn-over of powers and functions and the transfer of properties, BLTO exercised the powers and functions of LTO within the areas of the BARMM. However, some LTO enforces and government agencies did not recognize the validity of the issuances of BLTO outside BARMM areas because of their belief that BLTO issuances are valid only within the areas of the Bangsamoro region;

**WHEREAS**, this non-recognition of BLTO issuances caused confusion and inconvenience to motorists and other BLTO stakeholders and resulted to the filing of several complaints from apprehended BLTO stakeholders before the office of BLTO;

**WHEREAS**, because of this confusion and inconvenience many BARMM residents are opting to get or renew their driver’s licences and motor vehicle registration with LTO offices in Regions 9, 10, 11 and 12;

**WHEREAS**, series of interagency dialogues and meetings among the offices of the Office of the Presidential Adviser on Peace, Reconciliation, and Unity (OPAPRU), Department of Transportation (DOTr), Department of Budget and Management (DBM), Department of Justice (DOJ), Land Transportation Office (LTO), Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and MOTC-BARMM were conducted to thresh out the issues of non-recognition of BLTO issuances;

**WHEREAS**, these meetings resulted to the issuance of the “Guidelines in the Recognition of the BLTO Issuances of Driver’s Licenses, Renewal of Motor Vehicle Registration and Miscellaneous Transactions” signed by Assistant Secretary Atty. Vigor D. Mendoza II of LTO and approved by Secretary Jaime J. Bautista of DOTr on September 19, 2023 in order to avoid confusion and inconvenience to motorists, enforcers and other concerned authorities;

**WHEREAS**, pursuant to this guidelines, the driver’s licenses, renewal of motor vehicle registration and other miscellaneous issuances of BLTO are now recognized outside BARMM areas;

**WHEREAS**, it is the duty of the officials and employees of the BARMM to be an exemplar of commitment to the laws and authority of the Bangsamoro Government Offices;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved, by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to urge all government officials and employees within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region to obtain or renew their driver’s licenses their motor vehicle registrations with the Bangsamoro Land Transportation Office (BLTO).

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, that a copy of this resolution be furnished to all government offices in Bangsamoro region including the Local Government Units for information and guidance.
