**A RESOLUTION URGING THE BANGSAMORO DISASTER RISK REDUCTION AND MANAGEMENT COUNCIL (BDRRMC) TO DEVELOP A ROADMAP FOR THE BANGSAMORO ADAPTATION PLAN, ENSURING ITS INTEGRATION INTO THE DISASTER RISK REDUCTION AND MANAGEMENT PLAN, AND/OR TO LOCALIZE THE NATIONAL ADAPTATION PLAN FOR THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM)**

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao has developed its Bangsamoro Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan (BDRRM) Plan for 2023-2028, outlining key strategies for managing disaster risks in the region;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) has developed its Second Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP) for 2023 -2028 highlighting “Improving Ecological Integrity, Resilience of Communities, and Ensuring a Healthy and Clean Environment” in Chapter 12 of the BDP and “Disaster Resilience and Climate Change Adaptation” as one of the 12-Point Priority Agenda of the BARMM for 2023-2025;

**WHEREAS**, a composite social vulnerability index in the Philippines showed a trend of decreasing social vulnerability from south to north which is observed within the municipalities of the southern and western coastal regions of MIMAROPA, Zamboanga Peninsula, BARMM and SOCCSKSARGEN exhibiting the highest levels of social vulnerability;

**WHEREAS**, economic implications of inaction in the face of climate change impacts are unambiguous, with the cost of inaction in the 2030 decade estimated to be PHP645 billion per year across the eight sectors (Land use and human settlements, Energy, transport and communications, Livelihood and industries, Agriculture and Fisheries, Water resources, Cultural heritage, population displacement and migration, Health, and Ecosystems and Biodiversity);

**WHEREAS**, failing to proactively address the challenges posed by climate change places not only the well-being of Filipinos at risk but also poses a substantial economic burden for the nation;

**WHEREAS**, the Climate Change Commission (CCC) and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) have developed a multi-hazard, multi-sectoral National Adaptation Plan 2023-2050 for the Philippines, which serves as a strategic framework for prioritizing actions at the national and sub-national levels;

**WHEREAS**, the National Adaptation Plan 2023-2050 is expected to be further refined and downscaled, recognizing that ground-level actions, consistent with the science-policy-action continuum and supported by adequate investments and capacities, form the cornerstone of long-term climate change planning geared towards a low carbon, inclusive, sustainable, and transformative development path for the Filipino people;

**WHEREAS**, there is a need to develop a roadmap for a comprehensive adaptation plan and/or to localize the National Adaptation Plan for the Bangsamoro Region to effectively strengthen the climate governance in line with the region’s ongoing efforts and the objectives of the existing BDRRM Plan 2023-2028;

**WHEREAS**, the proposed development of a roadmap will specifically contribute to the effective implementation of the NAP 2023-2050, promoting consultative, evidence-based, and participatory planning and decision-making processes;

**WHEREAS**, contributing to the implementation of the NAP 2023-2050 in the Bangsamoro Region will help guide collective efforts from the government and various sectors to integrate adaptation into relevant policies and programs, thereby enhancing communities’ adaptive capacity and resilience to climate change.

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA), to strongly urge the Bangsamoro Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (BDRRMC) to develop a roadmap for the Bangsamoro Adaptation Plan, ensuring its integration into the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan, and/or to localize the National Adaptation Plan for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM);

**RESOLVED FINALLY**, that copies of this Resolution be furnished to the Office of the Chief Minister of BARMM and the Bangsamoro Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council through its Secretariat, the Bangsamoro Government’s Rapid Emergency Action on Disaster Incidence (READI-BARMM) for information and appropriate action.
