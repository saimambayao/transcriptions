**A RESOLUTION REQUESTING THE GENERAL SERVICES DIVISION (GSD) OF THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM) GOVERNMENT TO INSTALL ROOFS ON THE WALKWAYS INSIDE THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT CENTER (BGC)**

**WHEREAS**, under Section 15, Article I of the 1987 Philippine Constitution, the State shall *protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them*;

**WHEREAS**, according to Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and promote health and safety and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants;

**WHEREAS**, walking has been a basic form of transportation since ancient times, and people have always looked for ways to protect themselves from harsh weather while on the move. Covered walkways were invented as a solution to this problem, providing a sheltered path for people seeking refuge from the sun and rain. They have played a vital role in enabling easy pedestrian movement in various settings, such as marketplaces, religious institutions, and urban cities;

**WHEREAS**, the employees working at and clients visiting the Bangsamoro Government Center (BGC) often resort to walking when transferring from office to office within the complex;

**WHEREAS**, recent Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) Heat Index (as of April 21, 2024, 5:00 pm) reports reveal that the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) has a Heat Index of forty-two degrees Celsius (42°C)¹;

**WHEREAS**, with BARMM already classified as part of the "Danger" category, weather specialist Dr. John Manalo said that since the highest heat index values are usually recorded in May, there is a possibility that temperatures in the country may reach extreme danger levels or temperatures at 52°C or higher next month²;

**WHEREAS**, prolonged exposure to hot temperatures and exhausting activities in warm weather may lead to heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke, among other things;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Parliament provides that the Administrative and General Services Department (AGSD) shall formulate policies, plans, and programs related to the department's property management, engineering, maintenance, and other general administrative services, and ensure effective implementation thereof and compliance with government regulations and standards³;

**WHEREAS**, more specifically, the General Service Division (GSD) provides all the necessary resources such as facilities, and technical assistance, and performs all other required essential duties and functions for the effective and efficient provisioning of basic goods and services in the Bangsamoro Parliament. It oversees the maintenance of all mechanical, electrical, and communication facilities of the Parliament as well as the construction, maintenance, and repair of its grounds and facilities⁴;

**WHEREAS**, with rising temperatures due to climate change, there is a pressing need to create shaded areas, covered walkways, and green spaces that can provide relief from the heat;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Government should prioritize and protect the health and safety of the Bangsamoro people employed and transacting in the BGC daily by putting up roofs covering the walkways across the complex, creating infrastructure to shield them from extreme heat;

**WHEREAS**, by investing in such infrastructure, the government can significantly improve the quality of life for its citizens, reduce the risk of heat-related illnesses, and improve overall well-being;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Parliament of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to **urge the General Services Division (GSD) of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) government to put up roofs on the walkways inside the Bangsamoro Government Center (BGC).**
