**A RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR THE EFFICIENT USE OF PAPER RULE FOR THE PARLIAMENT**

**WHEREAS**, paper consumption is globally increasing at an unsustainable level leading to increasing greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, carbon emissions and wastewater discharge.

**WHEREAS**, paper usage has grown to 400% in the last 40 years. This means that over two (2) million trees are cut every day to satisfy global consumption for paper.

**WHEREAS**, the Pulp and Paper industry is one of the most pollution causing industries in the entire world due to its discharge of hazardous chemical compounds present in the wastewater after pulp and paper production.

**WHEREAS**, there exists an urgent need to reduce the Bangsamoro Government’s use of unnecessary and excessive quantities of paper to reduce the negative impact of pulp and paper production to our environment.

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Government can positively make a lasting impact on the movement towards sustainable ecological practices with the end view of saving our old-growth forests, conserving our precious water and avoiding the devastating impacts of climate change.

**WHEREAS**, it is high time the Bangsamoro Government takes urgent action to combat climate change by initiating the first step to improve awareness and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation and impact reduction.

**NOW THEREFORE**, be it
