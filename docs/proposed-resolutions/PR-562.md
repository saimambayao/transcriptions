**WHEREAS,** street vendors play a significant role in the local economy of the Bangsamoro Region, providing goods and services to residents and tourists alike;

**WHEREAS,** despite not being officially registered as businesses, the local economy continues to benefit from street vendors, thus the Bangsamoro Government should address and protect their rights and interests;

**WHEREAS,** the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Tourism (MTIT) is the primary government agency mandated to implement laws, programs, and projects on trade, investments, and tourism;

**WHEREAS,** the places wherein the street vendors frequent and conduct their trade often affect other surrounding establishments, traffic, and commuters;

**WHEREAS,** there is a need to ensure that the placement of street vendors is done in a manner that is safe, orderly, and conducive to both vendors and the general public;

**WHEREAS,** the MTIT, in coordination with the City/Municipal Local Government Units (LGUs) within the Bangsamoro region, conducts a comprehensive survey of street vendors to determine, among others, their numbers, locations, and needs;

**WHEREAS,** based on the survey results, the MTIT, together with the LGUs, are urged to develop a joint plan for the regulation and placement of street vendors, taking into consideration factors such as, but not limited to, pedestrian flow, traffic safety, sanitation, and urban aesthetics;

**WHEREAS,** The MTIT and Bangsamoro LGUs are called upon to ensure that the regulation and placement of street vendors are done in a manner that prioritizes their welfare, and respects their rights and dignity;

**WHEREAS,** the concerned agencies are further urged to provide street vendors with appropriate facilities, such as designated vending areas, sanitation facilities, and waste management services;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Parliament of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to ENCOURAGE THE MINISTRY OF TRADE, INDUSTRY, AND TOURISM (MTIT), IN COORDINATION WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNITs (LGUs) WITHIN BANGSAMORO REGION, TO FORMULATE A PROGRAM TO SUPPORT AND REGULATE THE ACTIVITIES OF STREET VENDORS.
