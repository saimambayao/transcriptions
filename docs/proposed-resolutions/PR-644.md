**A RESOLUTION REQUESTING THE BANGSAMORO PARLIAMENT TO ESTABLISH AN ASSOCIATION OF FORMER MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT (AFMP) TO ENHANCE GOVERNANCE, COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, AND THE PRESERVATION OF THE LEGISLATIVE HERITAGE OF THE BANGSAMORO REGION**

WHEREAS, former members of the Bangsamoro Parliament possess a wealth of experience and knowledge gained from their tenure, which is invaluable for the ongoing development and governance of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM);

WHEREAS, an organized platform for former parliamentarians will facilitate the continuity of their contributions to regional development and governance, allowing them to offer their insights, expertise, and advice on pressing issues facing the Bangsamoro region;

WHEREAS, establishing an association will provide a structured support system for former members, including opportunities for professional networking, mentorship, and the sharing of best practices among peers;

WHEREAS, the association will enhance the capacity of former parliamentarians to engage in community service, advocate for policies, and contribute to various civic and developmental initiatives within the Bangsamoro region;

WHEREAS, the ASSOCIATION OF FORMER MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT (AFMP) can play a crucial role in documenting the legislative history and contributions of its members, thus preserving the legacy and historical records of the Bangsamoro Parliament for future generations;

WHEREAS, similar to parliamentary systems in other countries such as the UK, with its Westminster system, Northern South Wales, and Canada, which all have established associations of former members of parliament, these organizations play a significant role in leveraging the extensive experience of former MPs to support the current government and benefit the nation;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, to establish the "Association of Former Members of Parliament" (AFMP) to provide a formal platform for former parliamentarians.

**RESOLVED FURTHER,** that the Bangsamoro Parliament is urged to approve and support the creation of the Association of Former Members of Parliament to enhance governance, community engagement, and the preservation of the legislative heritage of the Bangsamoro region.
