**A RESOLUTION URGING THE BANGSAMORO TRANSITION AUTHORITY PARLIAMENT TO PASS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE BILL ON THE CREATION OF PARLIAMENTARY DISTRICTS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM)**

**WHEREAS**, Section 7, Article VII of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law, mandates the creation of parliamentary districts to ensure fair, equitable, and proportional representation in the Bangsamoro Parliament;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Parliament enacted Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 58, otherwise known as “*An Act Providing for the Creation of Parliamentary Districts in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao*,” on February 28, 2024, and Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 77, otherwise known as the “*Bangsamoro Parliamentary Redistricting Act of 2025*,” on August 28, 2025, both for the purpose of establishing such districts;

**WHEREAS**, the Supreme Court, in its ruling on G.R. Nos. E-02219 and E-02235, declared Bangsamoro Autonomy Act Nos. 58 and 77 unconstitutional for failing to comply with the requirements set forth in the Bangsamoro Organic Law and the 1987 Philippine Constitution;

**WHEREAS**, the Supreme Court emphasized the necessity of enacting a new and valid districting law that adheres to constitutional and statutory standards, and consequently, the October 13, 2025 parliamentary elections were postponed due to the absence of a valid legal framework for district representation;

**WHEREAS**, the immediate passage of a new and valid parliamentary districting law is imperative to enable the Bangsamoro electorate to meaningfully exercise their right of suffrage and elect their duly chosen representatives to the Bangsamoro Parliament.

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority:

**TO PASS AND APPROVE THIS RESOLUTION URGING THE PARLIAMENT TO PASS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE CREATION OF A PARLIAMENTARY DISTRICT BILL IN THE BANGSAMORO**

Adopted, _________________________________.
