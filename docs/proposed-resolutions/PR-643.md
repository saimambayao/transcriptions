WHEREAS, the right to freedom of religion or belief is a fundamental human right enshrined in no less than our Philippine Constitution¹ and is essential for ensuring peace and social harmony;

WHEREAS, there have been numerous instances of religious-based conflicts in our Bangsamoro region that have led to loss of lives, displacement of communities, and disruption of social cohesion;

WHEREAS, repressive and discriminatory policies that threaten the right to freedom of religion or belief undermine the principles of equality and justice;

WHEREAS, the misuse of religion for political purposes and the politicization of religion have exacerbated tensions and contributed to the marginalization of certain communities, particularly the minority groups;

WHEREAS, cultivating a healthy political culture is crucial for ensuring that all individuals, regardless of their religion or ethnicity, have equal access to political participation and representation;

WHEREAS, the following offices or agencies, namely, the Ministry of Indigenous People’s Affairs, Regional Darul Ifta’, the Office for Settler Communities, and the Bangsamoro Commission for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage, share a common mandate to preserve cultural heritage and address community-specific needs. Each works to ensure that the traditions, rights, and identities of the cultural and social groups within their jurisdictions are respected and maintained. Although their focus and methods may vary, they collectively contribute to the overarching goal of cultural preservation and community support;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, that the Ministry of Indigenous People’s Affairs (MIPA), Regional Darul Ifta’ (RDI), the Office for Settler Communities (OSC), and the Bangsamoro Commission for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage (BCPCH) are urged to:

**1. Implement collaborative measures to promote intra and inter-community dialogue aimed at addressing religious and belief-based conflicts in BARMM; and**
