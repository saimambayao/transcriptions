**A RESOLUTION URGING THE MINISTRY OF BASIC, HIGHER, AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION (MBHTE) TO EXPAND ACCESS TO THE ALTERNATIVE LEARNING SYSTEM (ALS) PROGRAM BY INCREASING BUDGETARY SUPPORT, PROVIDING LEARNING MODULES, ESTABLISHING COMMUNITY LEARNING CENTERS, AND RECRUITING ADDITIONAL ALS FACILITATORS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION**

**WHEREAS,** the Bangsamoro Organic Law (Republic Act No. 11054) mandates that the Bangsamoro Government prioritize the welfare, rights, and development of youth and children through policies and programs that support their physical, educational, and socio-economic growth;

**WHEREAS,** the Alternative Learning System (ALS) provides non-formal education and second-chance learning opportunities for out-of-school youth and adults (OSYA) in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), including basic literacy and skills programs leading to accreditation and equivalency (World Bank, 2019);

**WHEREAS,** BARMM has the highest rate of out-of-school youth in the Philippines, with 46% of individuals aged 16-30 not attending school, which is double the national average, while school completion rates in BARMM are the lowest in the country due to barriers such as financial constraints, limited school access, and ongoing conflict¹;

**WHEREAS,** the participation rate in ALS programs in BARMM is critically low at only 5%, compared to the national rate of 13%, and ALS completion rates are significantly below the national average, underscoring the urgent need for enhanced ALS resources to address this education gap and support OSYA in achieving educational and vocational goals (World Bank, 2019);

**WHEREAS,** the same study revealed that there were challenges in the delivery of ALS, namely, among others, insufficient budget allocations, lack of learning modules, limited ALS facilitators, and a shortage of dedicated community learning centers, and more often than not, ALS facilitators cover program costs from their personal funds due to a lack of operational support;

**WHEREAS,** the aforementioned gaps in the implementation of the program limit its accessibility to the learners and beneficiaries;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED,** by the Bangsamoro Parliament, to urge the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education (MBHTE) to expand access to the Alternative Learning System (ALS) in BARMM by increasing budgetary support, providing additional learning modules, establishing community learning centers, and recruiting additional ALS facilitators to improve access to non-formal education for out-of-school youth and children in the region;

**RESOLVED, FURTHER,** that the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education (MBHTE), in coordination with the Ministry of Finance, Budget, and Management, shall ensure the allocation of sufficient funds for the ALS expansion and sustainability;

**RESOLVED, FURTHER,** that the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education shall collaborate with local government units, non-government organizations, and other stakeholders to enhance the implementation and accessibility of the ALS program;

**FINALLY, RESOLVED,** that copies of this resolution be furnished to the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education, the Ministry of Finance, Budget, and Management, the Office of the Chief Minister, and other relevant agencies for their information and necessary action.

**ADOPTED,**

(Sgd.)
