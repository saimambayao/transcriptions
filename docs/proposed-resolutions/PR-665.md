**WHEREAS**, Section 16, Article II of the Constitution specifically provides that the State shall protect and advance the right of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology in accord with the rhythm and harmony of nature;

**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Article IV of Republic Act No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) specifically provides that in the exercise of its right to self-governance, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is free to pursue its political, economic, social, and cultural development as provided for in the BOL;

**WHEREAS**, the same provision states that within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, **promote health and safety, enhance the right of people to a balanced ecology**, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, **enhance economic prosperity and social justice**, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and **preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants**;

**WHEREAS**, Section 37, Article XIII of the BOL provides that with regard to water supply and services, flood control and irrigation systems that connect or from facilities outside the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, there shall be cooperation and coordination between the Bangsamoro Government and the appropriate national or local government bodies;

**WHEREAS**, Section 12, Chapter 2, Title IV, Book III of Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 13 or the Bangsamoro Administrative Code provides that the **Chief Minister shall also appoint such other ministers and/or officers as may be necessary to perform the functions of government**;

**WHEREAS**, the geographical location of the Philippines makes it susceptible to strong typhoons, tsunamis, sea level rise, storm surges, flooding, landslides, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and other natural disasters. Located along the typhoon belt in the Pacific, it experiences an average of twenty (20) typhoons annually, five (5) of which are destructive. Additionally, being situated in the “Pacific Ring of Fire,” it is vulnerable to recurrent earthquakes and volcanic activity;

**WHEREAS**, flooding in various areas of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region not only causes an increasing number of casualties and widespread displacement of communities but also results in massive destruction to the livelihoods of the Bangsamoro people, their properties, and the cultural and natural heritage passed down to them by their ancestors;

**WHEREAS**, flooding in the Bangsamoro takes a significant toll on the economic growth and development of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, as it destroys critical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and public utilities, which impedes the movement and delivery of goods and services, thereby affecting trade and commerce;

**WHEREAS**, the issue of climate change has become increasingly apparent over time. With each passing season, super typhoons and El Niño have grown more intense, causing severe weather anomalies that have inflicted untold suffering on our people. These opposing natural phenomena have already strained the country’s delicate ecological balance, necessitating immediate action to mitigate or prevent the damage they may cause;

**WHEREAS**, the Philippines experiences some of the world’s highest rainfall in the form of tropical storms and super typhoons, with the resulting rainwater often ending up as runoff that inundates canals, rivers, and waterways, causing downstream flooding that destroys countless lives, properties, and crops;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is particularly vulnerable to various disasters, both natural and human-induced, including typhoons, floods, earthquakes, and armed conflicts, which pose significant threats to the lives, property, and environment of its people;

**WHEREAS**, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Flash Update No. 2 on Tropical Cyclone Trami/Kristine, issued on October 28, 2024, the BARMM Rapid Emergency Action on Disaster Incidence (READi) reports that around 607,185 people (121,437 families) have been affected across 34 municipalities in four BARMM provinces. Of these, 7,541 families remain in 18 evacuation centers. Seventeen houses were damaged, the majority of which were in Lanao del Sur. Over 1,900 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, affecting 1,585 farmers in the two Maguindanao provinces;

**WHEREAS**, it is vital for the Bangsamoro Government to strengthen its capacity to address preparedness, response, recovery, mitigation, and rehabilitation efforts related to floods in the region;

**WHEREAS**, effective flood control and management require a centralized and coordinated approach to ensure prompt and efficient response, recovery, and rehabilitation efforts;

**WHEREAS**, the creation of a position of Minister for Flood Control and Management (MFCM) within the Office of the Chief Minister would provide a focused framework for synchronizing efforts and ensuring coordination among various stakeholders, including government agencies, non-governmental organizations, civil society organizations, and international partners, in flood control, management, response, rehabilitation, and recovery;

**WHEREAS**, it is crucial to establish a clear mandate and designate dedicated official to strengthen flood control and management coordination in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS**, the MFCM shall serve as the overall authority in charge of flood control and management coordination, ensuring alignment with national and international frameworks while fostering collective efforts among all stakeholders;

**WHEREAS**, the Minister of FCM shall perform the following functions:

a) Ensure the alignment of flood preparedness, response, rehabilitation, and recovery efforts with national and international frameworks;

b) Lead the crafting and updating of the Flood Control and Management Plan (FCMP) and coordinate its implementation with relevant agencies, offices, and instrumentalities;

c) Coordinate with various local and national government agencies, offices, and instrumentalities, as well as international partners, for flood control operations, preparedness, response, and recovery efforts;

d) Advise the Chief Minister on the status of flood control projects and programs instituted by relevant government agencies within the Bangsamoro Region;

e) Advise the Chief Minister on the status of flood preparedness and flood control operations, including prevention, mitigation, response, and rehabilitation efforts;

f) Recommend to the Chief Minister the declaration of a state of calamity in affected areas and propose measures for their restoration, including the allocation of calamity funds;

g) Develop and oversee capacity-building programs to enhance the skills and preparedness of local government units (LGUs) and stakeholders in flood management;

h) Promote community-based flood risk management initiatives, ensuring the participation of vulnerable sectors in disaster planning and response;

i) Establish and maintain a data collection, monitoring, and reporting system for flood-related incidents, providing accurate and timely information for decision-making;

j) Advocate for sustainable flood control infrastructure projects that integrate environmental conservation and climate resilience principles; and

k) Perform such other functions and tasks as may be assigned by the Chief Minister.

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the Bangsamoro Parliament to pass and approve this Resolution urging the Chief Minister to create an additional minister position within the Office of the Chief Minister (OCM) to champion and oversee Flood Control and Management (FCM) in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM);
