**RESOLUTION URGING THE CHIEF MINISTER TO ESTABLISH A BANGSAMORO OFFICE FOR RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS (BORCA) UNDER THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MINISTER, FOR THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF COORDINATED ISLAMIC DA’WAH, INTERFAITH DIALOGUE, AND CULTURAL INTEGRATION IN THE BANGSAMORO REGION**

**WHEREAS**, the Interim Chief Minister, Honorable Abdulraof A. Macacua, called for the institutionalization of Da’wah in Bangsamoro governance through integrating Islamic propagation efforts within the governance framework to promote moral and ethical standards;

**WHEREAS**, the Philippine Constitution, in Article II, Section 6, affirms that “The separation of Church and State shall be inviolable,” while guaranteeing freedom of religion under Article III, Section 5, which protects the right of every individual to freely exercise and enjoy their religious profession and worship;

**WHEREAS**, the concept of benevolent neutrality allows the State to accommodate and support religious expressions and programs provided that such support does not establish a state religion nor infringe upon the religious freedoms of others;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Organic Law (Republic Act No. 11054), specifically Article IX, Section 3, mandates the preservation and promotion of the cultural and religious heritage of the Bangsamoro people, including Islamic values, traditions, and institutions;

**WHEREAS**, under the same law, the Bangsamoro Government is granted the autonomy to determine its policies and programs that reflect the history, culture, and aspirations of its people, including moral and spiritual development in line with Islamic teachings;

**WHEREAS**, the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB) recognizes the importance of respecting the distinct identity and religious practices of the Bangsamoro people, including the promotion of Islamic values as a foundation of moral governance;

**WHEREAS**, Da’wah, as an essential Islamic practice, entails the promotion of moral guidance, ethical behavior, spiritual development, and community well-being, and serves as a source of inspiration for values-based leadership and governance;

**WHEREAS**, promoting Da’wah across ministries, offices, and agencies would help institutionalize principles such as accountability, honesty, compassion, justice, and social responsibility, values that are integral not only to Islam but also to good governance;

**WHEREAS**, respecting the pluralistic character of the Bangsamoro region, the integration of Da’wah must be conducted in ways that are inclusive, non-coercive, and respectful of the beliefs of non-Muslim constituents, in accordance with the principle of mutual respect and coexistence;

**WHEREAS**, collaboration with religious groups and institutions, both Muslim and non-Muslim, is vital in ensuring that moral and cultural development programs implemented are context-sensitive, inclusive, and conducive to peace and social harmony;

**WHEREAS**, recognizing the significant gap in institutionalizing a centralized office that holistically coordinates Islamic Da’wah, interfaith dialogue, and cultural integration programs across the Bangsamoro Government, this Resolution seeks to establish the Bangsamoro Office for Religious and Cultural Affairs (BORCA) as a specialized institution under the Office of the Chief Minister, which shall serve as the lead coordinating agency in implementing Islamic Da’wah programs aligned with the principles of moral governance, and at the same time act as a bridge for engagement with non-Muslim, indigenous, and cultural communities, fostering peaceful coexistence and mutual respect.

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved, by the Bangsamoro Parliament in session assembled, that the Bangsamoro Government is hereby urged to institutionalize Da’wah, Islamic moral and cultural values, across all its ministries, agencies, and offices as a cornerstone of Islamic moral and ethical governance in public service; all ministries, agencies, and offices are encouraged to implement programs and policies reflecting core Islamic virtues such as justice, integrity, compassion, and accountability, while respecting the rights and beliefs of all Bangsamoro constituents;

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, that the proposed Bangsamoro Office for Religious and Cultural Affairs (BORCA) under the Office of the Chief Minister be designated as the central coordinating authority to oversee the implementation of these Da’wah initiatives across the Bangsamoro Government; and that all such initiatives be implemented in accordance with the principle of benevolent neutrality, without any form of religious coercion, and in full compliance with the Constitution’s guarantees of religious freedom and the separation of Church and State.

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, that a technical working group (TWG) be formed by the Office of the Chief Minister to draft the organizational charter, structure, and initial implementation framework of BORCA, with consultation from religious leaders, indigenous representatives, educators, and cultural experts;

**RESOLVED FINALLY**, that copies of this Resolution be furnished to the Office of the Chief Minister, the Ministry of the Interior and Local Government (MILG), the Darul-Ifta’ of BARMM, the Ministry of Indigenous Peoples’ Affairs (MIPA), the Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education (MBHTE), and other relevant offices for appropriate action and coordination.
