**Proposed Resolution No. 625**

Introduced by BTA Members:
Khalid Ma-amor Hadji Abdullah, Baintan A. Ampatuan, Sittie Fahanie S. Uy-Oyod and Diamla D. Ramos

**RESOLUTION**
**COMMENDING AND CONGRATULATING ATTY. NASHMYLEEN A. MAROHOMSALIC, THE FIRST BANGSAMORO AND FIRST FILIPINA AMONG A TOTAL OF FIVE (5) ADMITTED COUNSELS FROM THE PHILIPPINES, FOR HER ADMISSION AS COUNSEL BEFORE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT BY THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT BAR ASSOCIATION**

**WHEREAS,** the International Criminal Court (ICC) has a mandate to prosecute those responsible for the most serious crimes of concern to the International Community. In doing so, its proceedings follow the highest standards of due process and procedural process;

**WHEREAS,** The Rome Statute guarantees victims, accused persons and under certain conditions, suspects, the right to be assisted by counsel. The ICC strives to provide these individuals with a pool of highly qualified counsel;

**WHEREAS,** with the foregoing, only experienced lawyers who wish to represent defendants, victims or witnesses before the Honorable ICC must first be admitted to the list of counsel before the ICC. The admission is based on lawyer’s experience and litigation skills, and other series of criteria graded meticulously in order to ensure the quality of legal representation;

**WHEREAS,** to highlight the rigor of the selection process of counsels to be admitted by the ICC, as of early 2024, so far only four (4) Filipino lawyers are ICC-admitted counsels from the Philippines under the names of **GILBERT ANDRES, JOEL BUTUYAN, CHARLES JANZEN CHUA, and HERMINIO HARRY L. ROQUE;**

**WHEREAS,** after the rigorous selection process of year 2024 counsel-applicants from around the world, it was our Bangsamoro pride, **Atty. Nashmyleen A. Marohomsalic**, a Muslima lawyer who hailed from the Province of Lanao del Sur, a proud member of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines – Lanao del Sur Chapter, a fellow **Meranao**, who was among the chosen few to finally be an ICC-admitted counsel by the ICC Bar Association, making her the **5th Filipino Lawyer, first Filipina, and first Bangsamoro to be among the elite list of admitted counsel before the Honorable ICC;**

**WHEREAS,** with Atty. Marohomsalic’s dedication and hard work, another historical achievement has been attained by the Bangsamoro Community, not only locally but internationally, by a fellow Bangsamoro who is now a groundbreaker, especially in the field of International Law;

**NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED, BY THE BANGSAMORO PARLIAMENT,** to Commend and Congratulate Atty. Nashmyleen A. Marohomsalic, the first Bangsamoro and first Filipina among a total of five (5) admitted counsels from the Philippines, for her admission as counsel before International Criminal Court by the International Criminal Court Bar Association.

**RESOLVE, FURTHER,** to furnish a copy of this Resolution, either personally or through any modes of mailing, to the latest Bangsamoro pride herself, Atty. Nashmyleen A. Marohomsalic for information.

**ADOPTED,** ______________________.
