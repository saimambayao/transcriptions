**RESOLUTION**
**URGING THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY TO ADOPT A STANDARD COLOR SCHEME AND A MINIMUM SYMBOL OF BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO'S PROJECTS**

**WHEREAS,** Section 2, Article IV of Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), states that, "*In the exercise of its right to self-governance, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is free to pursue its political, economic, social, and cultural development as provided for in this Organic Law.*";

**WHEREAS,** Section 3, Article V of the BOL states that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants;

**WHEREAS,** Section 41, Article VII of the BOL states that public office is a public trust. Public officers and employees shall at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives;

**WHEREAS,** Section 37, Article XIII of the BOL states that the National Government shall fund and implement the construction and maintenance of the national roads, bridges, water supply and services, and flood control and irrigation systems and for the maintenance of the existing airports, seaports, and wharves in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region: *Provided*, That with regard to water supply and services, flood control and irrigation systems that connect or from facilities outside the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, there shall be cooperation and coordination between the Bangsamoro Government and the appropriate national or local government bodies. All national roads and bridges in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region shall be included in the National Road Network Information System. Nationally-funded infrastructure projects shall be implemented by the National Government.

The Bangsamoro Government shall submit proposals to the appropriate national government agency for the inclusion of the cost of such maintenance in the latter’s budget that shall be submitted to the Congress of the Philippines for inclusion in the General Appropriations Act. Funding for national roads, bridges, and irrigation systems shall be regularly released to the relevant departments of the National Government;

**WHEREAS,** Section 3 (J) of Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 13, or the Bangsamoro Administrative Code, states that the Bangsamoro Government, in pursuit of moral governance, shall maintain honesty, integrity, transparency and accountability, participation in governance and take positive and effective measures against graft and corruption;

**WHEREAS,** with the implementation of both the political and the normalization tracks of the peace agreement between the Government Philippines (GPH) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), a number of projects are being implemented by national government agencies, local government units, and development partners in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS,** implementation of a standard color as a uniform color and minimum symbol for all government projects redounds to the full benefit of the government against political identification;

**WHEREAS,** some project especially infrastructure projects built using public funds are painted with a color or bearing a symbol identifiable to a particular elective official or a group;

**WHEREAS,** it is advantageous for the government to have a single and uniform color scheme of implemented projects to avoid being associated to a person or a group;

**WHEREAS,** one of the keys to achieve a thriving region is to have a government that responds to the needs of its constituents, and having officials and employees that adhere to the principle of transparency; and

**WHEREAS,** in the interest of moral governance, the Bangsamoro Government must adopt a standard color and a minimum symbol on its projects.

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED,** by the BTA Parliament, to pass and approve this Resolution Urging the GOTD to Adopt a Standard Color Scheme and a Minimum Symbol of the BARMM's Projects.

Adopted,

**MP ENGR. BAINTAN ADIL-AMPATUAN, MNSA**
