**RESOLUTION**

**CALLING ON THE MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (MOST) IN COORDINATION WITH THE MINISTRY OF TRADE, INVESTMENTS AND TOURISM (MTIT) AND THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND AGRARIAN REFORM (MAFAR) TO CONDUCT RANDOM TESTING IN THE FISH SECTIONS OF THE MARKETPLACES IN BARMM TO ENSURE THE NON-PROLIFERATION OF THE DECEITFUL PRACTICE OF COATING FISH SLICES WITH PIG’S BLOOD BY MARKET VENDORS IN GENERAL SANTOS CITY**

WHEREAS, on 15 May 2023, a group of inspectors uncovered a deceitful practice in the fish section of a market in General Santos City wherein several market vendors were found coating fish slices with pig’s blood to give them a fresh and shiny appearance;

WHEREAS, according to a market worker in General Santos City, the malpractice has been ongoing since 2013 or even earlier;

WHEREAS, aside from violating fair business practices, sanitation, and safety regulations, the malpractice is a blatant disrespect to Muslims and other religious groups that prohibit eating pork, especially pig’s blood;

WHEREAS, General Santos City is proudly the Tuna Capital of the Philippines and is an active supplier of fresh and frozen tuna to markets locally and overseas;

WHEREAS, such fact makes the pervasiveness of the malpractice undetermined and makes it hard to tell whether a fish is contaminated or not;

WHEREAS, considering that the majority of the inhabitants of the Bangsamoro region regard the consumption of pork as forbidden and unlawful and recognizing the proximity of General Santos City to the Bangsamoro territories, there is a need to ensure that the fishes sold in the marketplaces of the region are uncontaminated with *Haram* elements;

WHEREAS, among the powers and functions of the Ministry of Science and Technology as provided in Paragraph (i), Section 3, Chapter 1, Title XIII of the Bangsamoro Administrative Code, is to contribute to the development and quality standards including *halal* for food and non-food industry through testing, analysis, and capacity-building;

WHEREAS, on 24 May 2023, the Ministry of Science and Technology - Bangsamoro Standards and Halal Testing Laboratories (MOST-BSHTL) has been granted accreditation by the Department of Trade and Industry - Philippine Accreditation Bureau;

WHEREAS, the conduct of random testing in the fish sections of the marketplaces in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao will not only serve as a preventive measure but will also help in deterring the introduction of such deplorable practices in the region;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the Bangsamoro Parliament, to CALL ON THE MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (MOST) IN COORDINATION WITH THE MINISTRY OF TRADE, INVESTMENTS AND TOURISM (MTIT) AND THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND AGRARIAN REFORM (MAFAR) TO CONDUCT RANDOM TESTING IN THE FISH SECTIONS OF THE MARKETPLACES IN BARMM TO ENSURE THE NON-PROLIFERATION OF THE DECEITFUL PRACTICE OF COATING FISH SLICES WITH PIG’S BLOOD BY MARKET VENDORS IN GENERAL SANTOS CITY;

**RESOLVED, FINALLY**, that copies of this resolution be furnished to the Offices of the Ministers of the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Ministry of Trade, Investments, and Tourism (MTIT), and Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Agrarian Reform (MAFAR).

**RESOLUTION**

**URGING THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE AND BUDGET AND MANAGEMENT (MFBM) TO PROMOTE AND ADOPT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO RECOGNIZE THE USE OF MULTI-YEAR BUDGETING AND PROJECT PROPOSALS**

WHEREAS, the validity of a fund in a particular fiscal year (FY) is governed by the strict provisions of budgeting laws, rules, and regulations such that after the end of the validity period, any unreleased appropriations lapse while undisbursed or unutilized funds revert to the Treasury;

WHEREAS, such circumstance promotes a “use-it-or-lose-it” mentality and works against a more orderly spending pattern, especially in major capital projects which require multiple years to complete;

WHEREAS, in other jurisdictions, local governments have gone beyond the State annual budget minimum requirement and opted to develop a longer-term operating horizon that helps them plan further out on their day-to-day services and also to provide justification for their revenue and expenditure predictions;

WHEREAS, multi-year budgeting allows approval of longer-term funding while a multi-year project (MYP) refers to a program or project which will take more than one year to complete and require multi-year appropriations and can also refer to a large-scale, stand-alone project which will be constructed over separate calendar years and which cannot be separated into smaller, independently operational phases;

WHEREAS, examples of multi-year programs or projects supported by continuing appropriations are those from existing laws such as R.A. No. 8150, otherwise known as the Public Works Act of 1995, and R.A. No. 6657 and R.A. No. 8532, which set funds specifically for the Agrarian Reform Program (ARP);

WHEREAS, the Department of Budget and Management recognizes the so-called “continuing appropriations,” which refers to those appropriations which have been previously enacted and continue to remain valid as an appropriation authority for the expenditure of public funds and also to appropriations available to support obligations for a specified purpose or project, such as multi-year construction projects which require the incurrence of obligations even beyond the budget year;

WHEREAS, continuing appropriations are covered by special laws and appropriated as one lump sum which does not lapse until its purpose is fulfilled;

WHEREAS, a study conducted on various local governments applying multi-year budgeting yielded positive findings:
1. Reduces political problems as the budget reaffirmation occurs annually, and the budget is less likely to be affected by political fray;
2. Reinforces commitment to long-term fiscal health by looking beyond a one-year time horizon in our ability to fund operating programs and capital improvements;
3. Providing residents with more certainty about the direction of local government services, finances, and tax levels;
4. Making more strategic use of the governing body’s time in reviewing budgets and the administration’s time in preparing them;
5. Focusing on continuous improvement and implementation and not just planning;
6. Retaining the benefits of an annual budget through quarterly reviews and “tweaking;”
7. Having the ability to incorporate operating costs linked to the capital improvement plan;
8. Instilling discipline to control spending plan changes;
9. Allowing elected officials to see how important programs get implemented over time when they are timed to the council/commission election cycle;
10. Promotes more orderly spending patterns; in other words, mitigates against the use-it-or-lose-it mentality; and
11. Planning long-term so that long-term goals can be achieved.

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) is in the process of building the foundations of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM);

WHEREAS, there is a need to adopt mechanisms that help the government keep an eye on the future and ensures that the activities being undertaken are sustainable, impactful, achievable, and time-bound;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the Bangsamoro Parliament, to URGE THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE AND BUDGET AND MANAGEMENT (MFBM) TO PROMOTE AND ADOPT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO RECOGNIZE THE USE OF MULTI-YEAR BUDGETING AND PROJECT PROPOSALS;

**RESOLVED, FINALLY**, that copies of this resolution be furnished to the Office of the Chief Minister (OCM) and the offices of all the Bangsamoro Ministers.

**RESOLUTION**

**URGING THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT TO ADOPT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO RECOGNIZE THE USE OF DIGITAL SIGNATURES**

WHEREAS, Electronic and Digital Signatures are gradually taking the place of traditional methods of physical or “wet ink” signatures;

WHEREAS, notwithstanding the fact that the phrases “electronic signature” and “digital signature” are frequently used interchangeably, the latter is more secure than the former;

WHEREAS, Electronic signatures are created and added to contracts by individuals and teams signing or marking the document in some way, while digital signatures, by contrast, are created by software and algorithms;

WHEREAS, an Electronic Signature does not show any information that will indicate that the same had been authorized by the owner of the signature, and thus it can be copied or cut and pasted onto another document to misrepresent that it had been signed by somebody when in truth the person had not signed the document;

WHEREAS, Digital Signature, on the other hand, shows the following information:
a) The signature is valid;
b) The document has not been modified since the signature was applied;
c) The signer’s identity has been verified;
d) The signing time is indicated;
e) The certificate has not been revoked; and
f) The Department of Science and Technology is the government agency issuing the Certificate of Authority.

WHEREAS, other important functions of a Digital Signature include the following:
a) After the signature is affixed to a document, the signatory can lock the document to prohibit any other change;
b) It allows for the confirmation that the document is authentic and coming from a verified source;
c) The identity of the signatory has been verified by a publicly trusted organization; and
d) The document has not been tampered with since being digitally signed;

WHEREAS, various Government agencies, including the Office of the Solicitor General, Securities and Exchange Commission, Bureau of Internal Revenue, and other Cities and Municipalities have also started using digital signatures;

WHEREAS, the Anti-Red Tape Authority has directed government agencies to avail of and recognize the use of Digital Signatures using the Philippine National Public Key Infrastructure (PNPKI);

WHEREAS, the Philippine National Public Key Infrastructure of the Department of Information and Communications Technology provides a secure digital signature service using certificates issued and digitally signed by a certificate authority (CA) to which the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authenticates the data source and ensures data has not been tampered with in transit;

WHEREAS, the DICT has announced that the application for the digital certificate is offered for free to both public and private agencies, institutions, and organizations;

WHEREAS, the recognition and employment of digital signatures will greatly help in expediting the legislative process, especially in filing legislative measures considering that its authors and co-authors will no longer have to be physically present to sign each bill, resolution, and committee report;

WHEREAS, it will also minimize the burden on the part of the members of the parliament who reside outside Cotabato City and whose time is usually constrained by the demands of their respective constituencies;

WHEREAS, governments around the world have accelerated the shift towards the digitalization of many public services as digital technologies have emerged as a key element of economic and social resilience, especially during times of pandemic;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the Bangsamoro Parliament, to URGE THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT TO ADOPT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO RECOGNIZE THE USE OF DIGITAL SIGNATURES;

**RESOLVED, FINALLY**, that copies of this resolution be furnished to the Office of the Chief Minister, Office of the Speaker, Office of the Secretary General, and the offices of all the Bangsamoro Ministers.
