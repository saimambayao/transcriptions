**WHEREAS,** Section 15, Article XIV of the 1987 Constitution states that it is the policy of the State to conserve, promote, and popularize the nation's historical and cultural heritage and resources, as well as artistic creations;

**WHEREAS,** Section 5, Article II of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides that the maintenance of peace and order, the protection of life, liberty, and property, and promotion of the general welfare are essential for the enjoyment by all the people of the blessings of democracy;

**WHEREAS,** Section 2, Article IV of the Republic Act No. 11054, also known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), states that in the exercise of its right to self-governance, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is free to pursue its political, economic, social, and cultural development as provided for in this Organic Law;

**WHEREAS,** Section 35, Article XIII of the BOL states that the Bangsamoro Government shall promote tourism within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS,** Section 1 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 9535, or the “Tourism Act of 2009” states that the State declares tourism as an indispensable element of the national economy and an industry of national interest and importance, which must be harnessed as an engine of socio-economic growth and cultural affirmation to generate investment, foreign exchange and employment, and to continue to mold an enhanced sense of national pride for all Filipinos;

**WHEREAS,** BARMM offers diverse tourist attractions and destinations, such as Lake Lanao; Tawi-Tawi’s untouched beaches and marine biodiversity; cultural sites like Marawi City’s Grand Mosque and the mosques in Cotabato City; and other historical landmarks such as the Sultan Kudarat Monument, among others²;

**WHEREAS,** Augmented Reality (AR) is an enhanced, interactive version of the real-world environment, achieved through digital visual elements, sounds, and other sensory stimuli via holographic technology. AR incorporates three key features: the integration of digital and physical worlds, real-time interaction, and accurate 3D identification of virtual and real objects³;

**WHEREAS,** Augmented Reality has the potential to transform the visitor experience into a more compelling and exciting journey through the use of AR technology, which can feature each and every destination within the region;

**WHEREAS,** Augmented Reality technology includes the use of computer-generated content, images, 360-degree views of locations, and other animations and/or graphics that provide information, recommendations, trivia, and other details—promoting specific locations in the region while also making it easier for users to navigate between websites, social media platforms, and other digital resources;

**WHEREAS,** the featured sites will be equipped with Quick Response (QR) codes linked to holographic displays;

**WHEREAS,** tourists can access 360-degree panoramic views, animations, graphic materials, and other engaging information designed to entice them to visit, by scanning the QR codes using their tablets or smartphones with the Augmented Reality application installed;

**WHEREAS,** this technology aims to promote the region's resources, businesses, and tourist attractions, while simultaneously enabling smooth virtual participation in must-see locations across the region;

**WHEREAS,** such Augmented Reality experiences may be showcased in every local government unit (LGU), as well as in museums and other strategic locations, to provide tourists with a brief overview of specific destinations within those LGUs;

**WHEREAS,** to implement this Augmented Reality (AR) technology, the Ministry of Trade, Investments, and Tourism (MTIT) is encouraged to collaborate with local innovators whose expertise lies primarily in the use of AR technology;

**WHEREAS,** the MTIT is the ministry mandated to implement laws, programs, and projects related to trade, investment, and tourism in the Bangsamoro Region;

**WHEREAS,** the MTIT shall develop an approach that is best suited for this era of technology in promoting existing tourist attractions, as well as other locations with the potential to become tourist destinations;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED,** by the Bangsamoro Parliament, to pass and approve this Resolution Urging the Ministry of Trade, Investments, and Tourism (MTIT) to Adopt the Use of Augmented Reality (AR) in Promoting the Tourism Sites in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM);
