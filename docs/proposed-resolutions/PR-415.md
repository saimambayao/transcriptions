**INVITING THE OFFICIALS OF CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY OF THE PHILIPPINES (CAAP), DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS AND HIGHWAYS (DPWH) REGION XII, MINISTRY OF TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATION-BANGSAMORO AIRPORT AUTHORITY (MOTC-BAA), AND AIRPORT MANAGERS OF PHILIPPINE AIRLINES (PAL) AND CEBU PACIFIC (CEBUPAC), TO SHED LIGHT ON THE STATUS OF THE REHABILITATION OF THE AWANG AIRPORT IN BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION, IN AID OF LEGISLATION**

WHEREAS, Section 3, Article V of R.A. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are **essential to the promotion of general welfare**. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants;

WHEREAS, Section 37, Article XIII of the BOL categorically provides that the National Government shall fund and implement the construction and maintenance of national roads, bridges, water supply and services, and flood control services and irrigation system and for the **maintenance of existing airports**, seaports and wharves in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

WHEREAS, the Ministry of Transportation and Communication (MOTC) is one of the primary ministries established under Section 8, Article XVI of the BOL. By nature of its functions, the Ministry shall be responsible for the maintenance and expansion of viable and dependable transportation and communications systems for effective recovery and economic progress of the BARMM;

WHEREAS, on June 21, 2023, the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) for the temporary closure of the airport in Barangay Awang, Datu Odin town in Maguindanao Del Norte, due to the P340-million runway and airport rehabilitation project¹;

WHEREAS, in compliance of the aforementioned NOTAM, both Philippine Airlines (PAL) and Cebu Pacific canceled all their flights at Awang Airport effective June 22, 2023²;

WHEREAS, the Awang Airport serves as a vital gateway for transportation and commerce not only in Cotabato City, but also in the two adjacent Maguindanao provinces and the overall majority of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

WHEREAS, the sudden closure of the airport drew flak among officials, travelers, and traders in the Bangsamoro Region for the lack of advance notice regarding its closure;

WHEREAS, even the Minister of Transportation and Communication MP Atty Paisalin Tago was not aware of the closure of the airport, stating in an interview that, “*we were not even informed about it.*³”

WHEREAS, Minister Tago then called for a meeting with officials from both the CAAP and the DPWH to discuss the planned rehabilitation of the airport’s runway. The repair works, including asphalt overlay are carried out by the DPWH Regional Office in the SOCCSKSARGEN region⁴;

WHEREAS, according to the Chair of BARMM Business Council, Atty. Ronald Hallid Torres, the Awang Airport has long been a vital artery for the economic growth and development in the BARMM, facilitating the seamless movements of people, goods and services and its closure, although temporary, will undeniably disrupt the normal functioning of business in the region⁵;

WHEREAS, on August 19, 2023, after two months of runway asphalt repair, the airport has been reopened, but only for private and military purposes only⁶;

WHEREAS, Carmencita Salik, the general manager of the Cotabato Airport Authority (CAA) under the BARMM’s MOTC, said that the airport would allow the resumption of commercial flights on October 1, 2023, to allow more than one month for other repairs⁷;

WHEREAS, before it was temporarily closed for repairs, both PAL and Cebu Pacific had 31 weekly flights from Cotabato to various cities in the Philippines⁸;

WHEREAS, the continued closure of the airport can cause an extensive loss for the economy of the region and can disrupt the promotion of the region as a tourism destination and investment hub;

WHEREAS, in addition, the continued closure of the airport can sow a long-term negative impact on the businesses in the region, especially those that rely on the movement of goods and people;

WHEREAS, the failure to update the current status of such ongoing repairs, and the continued closure of the airport can delay and disrupt the ongoing development of the Bangsamoro Region; and

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA), as the interim government of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region should conduct an investigation, in aid of legislation, on the current status of the repair and rehabilitation of the Awang Airport.

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the BTA Parliament, to pass and approve this Resolution inviting the officials of the CAAP, DPWH Region XII, MOTC-BAA, and Airport Managers of the Philippine Airlines and the Cebu Pacific, to shed light on the status of the rehabilitation of the Awang Airport in Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, in aid of legislation.

Adopted,
