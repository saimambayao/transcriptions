WHEREAS, Article II, Section 5 of the 1987 Constitution states. “The maintenance of peace and order, the protection of life, liberty, and property, and promotion of the general welfare are essential for the enjoyment by all the people of the blessing of democracy”;

WHEREAS, a deadly bomb attack occurred on December 3, 2023 at around 7:30 a.m. during a Catholic liturgical mass attended by students and teachers at the Dimaporo Gymnasium, Mindanao State University Main campus in Marawi City;

WHEREAS, this dastardly act of terrorism claimed the lives of four MSU students and faculty, namely, Riza Daniel Ramos, Junerey Taub Berbante, Evangeline Sarces Aromin, and Janine Orcia Arenas while forty-six (46) victims were wounded and hurt.

WHEREAS, the senseless bombing was committed against innocent students and faculty members, on a Sunday, while they were celebrating the first Sunday of Advent.

WHEREAS, the Parliament strongly condemns the bombing as a terroristic attack, which utterly disregarded the sanctity of human life and solemnity of religious worship.

WHEREAS, in solidarity with the families of the victims and the MSU community during this difficult period, we affirm that the Parliament is unwavering in its commitment to uphold peace and justice and to promote dialogue of life and faith among Muslims and Christians as anathema to hatred, intolerance and extremism.

WHEREAS, the Parliament urges all law enforcement agencies to conduct a swift and thorough investigation so that the perpetrators behind this atrocity be held accountable and put behind bars.

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved, that the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament strongly condemns the MSU bombing, condoles with the victims and their families and stand with the entire MSU community in reclaiming the peace and demanding justice.
