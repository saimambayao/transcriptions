**A RESOLUTION**
**URGING THE BANGSAMORO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL (BEDC) AND THE INTER-GOVERNMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT BOARD TO JOINTLY FORMULATE A LONG-TERM INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND INVESTMENT PROGRAM IN THE NEXT 15 YEARS (2023-2038) FOR THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM)**

**WHEREAS,** the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), now the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), has been left out in Mindanao’s development processes due to the scant attention it has received from the national government especially in terms of its infrastructure development. ARMM has received the smallest infrastructure funding of 900 million annually, the lowest in the entire country. Thus, ARMM has the lowest infrastructure development index. Hence, there is a need for a long-term Infrastructure Development Plan and Investment Program of BARMM;

**WHEREAS,** Section 4, Article XIII of Republic Act No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) mandates that the Bangsamoro Parliament shall establish the Bangsamoro Economic Development Council (BEDC) which shall serve as the planning, monitoring, and coordinating agency for all development plans, programs and projects of the Bangsamoro Government. It shall evaluate and recommend short, medium, and long-term comprehensive development plans, programs, and projects for the BARMM, subject to the approval of the Parliament. The said Council has already been created by a law by the Parliament;

**WHEREAS,** Section 6, Article VI of the BOL created an Inter-Governmental Infrastructure Development Board which shall be responsible for the coordination and synchronization of the National Government and the Bangsamoro Government’s Infrastructure Development Plan. The members of the Board consist of officials from the BARMM, such as officials from the Ministry of Public Works (MPW), as well as officials from the national government, like the Secretary of the Public Works and Highways and his designated officials for such purposes;

**WHEREAS,** the formulation processes shall be coordinated by the Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority (BPDA), created by the BTA Parliament under Bangsamoro Autonomy Act (BAA) No. 6 to serve as the support office and technical secretariat of the BEDC;

**WHEREAS,** the long-term Infrastructure Development Plan and Investment Program shall be funded both by the national government for national programs, while regional programs shall be funded by the Bangsamoro Government from the Block Grant;

**WHEREAS,** a copy of the formulated Infrastructure Development Plan and Investment Program of BARMM shall be furnished to the National Government, through the NEDA, for its inclusion in the National Development Plan and Investment Program of the National Government, as required by the Organic Law;

**WHEREAS,** the Infrastructure Development Plan and Investment Program shall define the vision, mission, goals, and objectives of the autonomous region on infrastructure development and will outline its policies, strategies, and programs and projects, including those with short, medium, and long-term perspectives.

**WHEREAS,** the Infrastructure Development Plan and Investment Program shall also include priority lists which shall contain proposals using key stages of project development, such as early stages, potential investment options, and investment-ready proposals.

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED** by the BTA Parliament to pass and approve this Resolution urging the Bangsamoro Economic Development Council and the Inter-Governmental Infrastructure Development Board to jointly formulate a Long-Term Infrastructure Development Plan and Investment Program in the next 15 years (2023-2038) for the BARMM.
