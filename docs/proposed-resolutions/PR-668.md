**WHEREAS**, Article III, Section 22 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution recognizes and promotes the rights of Indigenous Cultural Communities within the framework of national unity and development;

**WHEREAS**, Article XII, Section 5 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution mandates the State to protect the rights of Indigenous Cultural Communities to their ancestral lands to ensure their economic, social, and cultural well-being;

**WHEREAS**, R.A. 8371, otherwise known as the "Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act of 1997," provides under Section 7(d) that in case of displacement due to natural catastrophes, the State shall endeavor to resettle the displaced ICCs/IPs in suitable areas and ensure their right to return to their ancestral lands when normalcy is restored;

**WHEREAS**, Section 22 of the same law ensures the special protection and security of Indigenous Peoples during armed conflicts, requiring the State to observe international standards for the protection of civilian populations;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Indigenous Peoples Act of 2024 or BAA 64, Section G, provides that in cases of displacement due to armed conflict, human-induced disasters, and natural hazards, the Bangsamoro Government shall provide resettlement, healthcare, and other basic services to displaced ICCs/IPs, and ensure their right to return to their ancestral lands when safety and normalcy are restored;

**WHEREAS**, on December 7, 2024, at 1:00 PM in Sitio Kokor, Barangay Mahantao, Datu Hofer, Maguindanao del Sur, Baywan Angan, a well-respected leader of the Mënubú Dulangan tribe with Lambangian ancestry and a staunch advocate for Indigenous Peoples' rights, was killed in a violent incident;

**WHEREAS**, Angan was a dedicated leader who fought for the protection of ancestral lands, and his death is a tragic loss for the Indigenous community, highlighting the persistent threats faced by Indigenous leaders advocating for their rights;

**WHEREAS**, on December 19, 2024, Cita Angan, the wife of Baywan Angan, was ambushed and killed while on her way to receive food assistance from the Ministry of Social Services and Development (MSSD-BARMM). Her murder is particularly alarming as she was the sole witness to her husband's killing, further exposing the ongoing threats and violence faced by Indigenous Peoples;

**WHEREAS**, since 2019, Cita Angan's death marks the 87th recorded killing of Non-Moro Indigenous Peoples (NMIP) in the Bangsamoro region, a grave indication of the continuing injustices, discrimination, and human rights violations suffered by Indigenous communities;

**WHEREAS**, an Inter-Agency Dialogue was convened in Datu Hofer, Maguindanao del Sur, with key stakeholders, including representatives from the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) 6th Infantry Division, Maguindanaon leaders, BARMM ministries and offices, the Police Regional Office of BARMM (PRO-BARMM), the Local Government Unit of Datu Hofer, peace mechanisms, and Indigenous community leaders, to address the ongoing violence against Indigenous Peoples;

**WHEREAS**, during the dialogue, the following concerns and recommendations were raised:

1. The urgent need to establish a military detachment in Sitio Kokor, Barangay Mahantao, due to security threats posed by lawless armed groups that endanger Indigenous communities;
2. A call to action from Western Mindanao Command General Nafarete, urging the Local Government Unit of Datu Hofer to establish Task Force Mahantao, encourage Indigenous communities to utilize legal avenues for justice, and collaborate with human rights organizations for the protection of civilian populations;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved, that the Non-Moro Indigenous Communities in Barangay Mahantao, Datu Hofer, Maguindanao del Sur, respectfully request the 6th Infantry Division, Philippine Army, to establish a military detachment in Sitio Kokor, Barangay Mahantao, Datu Hofer, Maguindanao del Sur, to ensure the safety, security, and protection of Indigenous Peoples residing in the area;

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, that copies of this resolution be furnished to the 6th Infantry Division, Philippine Army, the Office of the Municipal Mayor of Datu Hofer, the Office of the Governor of Maguindanao del Sur, and other relevant agencies for their information and appropriate action.
