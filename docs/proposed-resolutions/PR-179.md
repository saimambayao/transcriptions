**WHEREAS**, Section 2, 3rd par. of RA 8976 also known as the Philippine Food Fortification Act of 2000 states that the State recognizes that food fortification is vital where there is a demonstrated need to increase the intake of an essential nutrient by one or more population groups, as manifested in dietary, biochemical or clinical evidences of deficiency. Food fortification is considered important in the promotion of optimal health and to compensate for the loss of nutrients due to processing and/or storage of food.

**WHEREAS**, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), Vitamin A Deficiency (VAD) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality from common childhood infections, and is the world’s leading preventable cause of childhood blindness. Vitamin A deficiency also contributes to maternal mortality and other poor outcomes of pregnancy and lactation;

**WHEREAS**, furthermore, VAD is the most damaging micronutrient deficiencies in the world, and are the consequence of low dietary intake of Iron, Vitamin A, Iodine and Zinc. VAD is most prevalent among the poor households whose diets are based mainly on rice or other carbohydrate-rich, micronutrient-poor calorie sources;

**WHEREAS**, the Department of Agriculture- Philippine Rice Research Institute (DA-PhilRice) and International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) had been working in convergence with organizations in the agriculture and nutrition sectors to develop and deploy Golden Rice as a potential new type of rice based approach to improve Vitamin A status in the country;

**WHEREAS**, In July 2021, the Director of the Philippines Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Plant Industries (DA-BPI) signed off on the Commercial Propagation Permit for Golden Rice in the Philippines. For this reason the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) announced that the "Philippines becomes first country to approve nutrient-enriched Golden Rice for planting". That Filipino farmers will become the first in the world to be able to cultivate a variety of rice enriched with nutrients to help reduce childhood malnutrition (*Source: Golden Rice Humanitarian Board*);

**WHEREAS**, according to DA-PhilRice, Golden rice is safe, certified by Food Standards Australia New Zealand, Health Canada, and United States Food and Drug Administration, and affordable rice, which has shown to have clear health benefits, with high content of Beta Carotene, also known as Provitamin A. Aside from good for vision, Vitamin A enhances human immune response to disease and promotes growth and development;

**WHEREAS**, Golden Rice Program has the potential to complement the existing efforts of the national government to reduce the incidence of preventable blindness and other VAD-induced diseases among under-five children and including pregnant and lactating women;

**WHEREAS**, the Expanded National Nutrition Survey (ENNS) conducted by the Department of Science and Technology- Food and Nutrition Research Institute revealed that in 2018-2019 approximately 103,000 children under 6-59 months are at risk from Vitamin A Deficiency (VAD) in the three (3) provinces of BARMM which are the Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur and Basilan with the prevalence rates of 38.1%, 12.7% and 12.7% respectively. These categories are considered to be of moderate to severe public health concern based on 1996 WHO cut-off limit;
