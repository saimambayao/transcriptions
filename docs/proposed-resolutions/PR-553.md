**RESOLUTION CALLING FOR THE BANGSAMORO COMMISSION FOR THE PRESERVATION OF CULTURAL HERITAGE TO SPEARHEAD THE CAMPAIGN AND NOMINATE CELEBRATED TAUSUG ARTIST RAMEER AMILASAN TAWASIL FOR THE 2025 ORDER OF NATIONAL ARTISTS AWARD, THEREBY RECOGNIZING HIS SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO PHILIPPINE ARTS AND CULTURAL HERITAGE**

**WHEREAS,** the Order of National Artist (ONA) is the highest recognition for artists in the Philippines who, through their lifetime commitment, have significantly enriched the country’s cultural heritage;

**WHEREAS,** this award confers the rank and title of being a National Artist, as proclaimed by the Philippine president, which honor further celebrates artistic excellence, emphasizing the role of creative expression in shaping the nation’s cultural identity;

**WHEREAS,** in 2006, sculptor and painter Abdulmari Asia Imao achieved the distinction of being the first, and sole, Muslim artist to be conferred the title of National Artist for Visual Arts, a status he will hold for life and in death;

**WHEREAS,** the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, in partnership with the Cultural Center of the Philippines, recently issued a call for public nominations for new National Artist for 2025;

**WHEREAS,** Section 25, Article IX of the Bangsamoro Organic Law mandates that the Bangsamoro Commission for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage (BCPCH) the primary responsibility to write the history of the Bangsamoro people, and to establish and sustain the cultural institutions, programs, and projects in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS,** the late Rameer Tawasil brought pride and distinction to the Bangsamoro community through his sheer dedication and commitment to his craft, which has earned him numerous accolades and recognition both here and abroad;

**WHEREAS,** his artistic prowess transcended boundaries and elevated the vibrant colors and profound narratives of the Sulu Archipelago (Sulu, Basilan, Tawi-Tawi), showcasing the abundance and resilience of the Bangsamoro culture to the world;

**WHEREAS,** the Bangsamoro Parliament has previously paid tribute to Tawasil for his extraordinary contributions to Bangsamoro culture and arts. His invaluable contributions to the Bangsamoro visual arts and culture have been recognized and supported by institutions such as the Cultural Center of the Philippines, Vargas Museum in the University of the Philippines, National Commission for Culture and the Arts Gallery, Metropolitan Museum of Manila, The Gallery of the Peninsula and the Archipelago, and various private galleries;

**WHEREAS,** his masterpieces have graced esteemed galleries in London in the United Kingdom, and Kuching, Malaysia, as well as private collections in Germany, Korea, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Philippines, affirming the universal appeal of and appreciation for his art;

**WHEREAS,** the demise of Rameer Tawasil in 2023 left a profound void in the artistic landscape not only in the region but in the entire country as well. Yet his enduring influence and inspirational artworks persist, shaping and motivating future generations;

**WHEREAS,** the presence of Rameer Amilasan Tawasil as an artist serves as both inspiration and a model for the Bangsamoro youth, especially those who are artistically gifted and who are enthusiastic in their pursuit of the arts, paving a new path for the young Bangsamoro to dream for a future—and carve out a future—in the creative world;

**WHEREAS,** Rameer Amilasan Tawasil not only promoted art for art’s sake, but consciously pushed positive advocacies that aimed not only to portray the realities of the Bangsamoro, but also to uplift its hopes for a better, more prosperous future. His “peace dove” design in 2006, for instance, received the Peace Citation Award and became part of the international symbol of birds used in peace campaigns worldwide. His advocacies range from women’s rights, environmental preservation, peace, to children’s rights, among many other things;

**WHEREAS,** the nomination of Rameer Amilasan Tawasil for National Artist for the Visual Arts will facilitate a much-needed and long-awaited departure from the biased and inaccurate portrayal of the Bangsamoro people in some aspects of Philippine society that are connected to its convoluted past. Tawasil’s art made tangible inroads toward a narrative that exemplifies peace and progress in the region, boosting the Bangsamoro region’s image and reputation inside and outside the country;

**WHEREAS,** undoubtedly, Rameer Amilasan Tawasil has elevated the country’s regard for art, and the regard of the world for Filipino artists. Therefore, his contributions to the field merit the highest recognition, not just from our Parliament, but also from the national government. This initiative should be made by the BCPCH, which has the primary responsibility of recording and preserving the history of the Bangsamoro people;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved, by the Bangsamoro Parliament, to call for the Bangsamoro Commission for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage to spearhead the campaign and nominate celebrated Tausug artist Rameer Amilasan Tawasil for the 2025 Order of National Artist Award, thereby further recognizing his significant contributions to Philippine arts and cultural heritage.

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED,** that copies of this resolution be furnished to the Bangsamoro Commission for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage for its information, guidance, and appropriate action.
