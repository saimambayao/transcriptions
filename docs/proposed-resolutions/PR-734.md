**A RESOLUTION URGING THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH – BARMM TO STRENGTHEN RESPONSE AND PREPAREDNESS MEASURES FOR MONKEYPOX IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM)**

**WHEREAS**, as of June 23, 2025, the Ministry of Health – BARMM, through its Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit (RESU), reported a total of eight (8) confirmed, two (2) probable, and forty-three (43) suspected cases of monkeypox in the Bangsamoro Region, with Cotabato City, Maguindanao del Sur, and Maguindanao del Norte reporting the highest case counts, thereby heightening public health concerns in view of BARMM’s unique geographic, socio-economic, and healthcare access limitations¹;

**WHEREAS**, the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)** has reported that monkeypox continues to pose significant health risks both globally and in the United States, with widespread human-to-human transmission and the need for sustained public health preparedness and response²;

**WHEREAS**, **monkeypox** is a zoonotic viral disease caused by the **monkeypox virus (MPXV)**, primarily transmitted through close contact with lesions, body fluids, contaminated materials, or respiratory droplets, with potential complications including bacterial infections, pneumonia, and death, and case fatality rates between **1% to 10%** in outbreaks³;

**WHEREAS**, the Philippines, as a State Party to the International Health Regulations (IHR)-(2005), is committed to strengthening its capacities for surveillance, reporting, and response to public health emergencies of international concern; and under Section 15, Article II of the 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines, is mandated to "protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them," a responsibility devolved to local government units pursuant to Republic Act No. 7160 (Local Government Code of 1991), and to the Bangsamoro Government under Republic Act No. 11054, also known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law, particularly Article VI (Powers and Competencies) and Article IX (Health);

**WHEREAS**, the **Ministry of Health – BARMM** has proactively initiated public information campaigns, surveillance, and response protocols to manage the emerging threat, but challenges persist due to limitations in health infrastructure, capacity gaps, and the need for sustained resource mobilization;

**WHEREAS**, in order to effectively manage the monkeypox situation and protect public health in BARMM, there is an urgent need for intensified disease surveillance and case management, establishment of isolation and treatment facilities with adequate medical supplies and personal protective equipment, provision of antiviral medications, expanded public information campaigns, continuous capacity-building for health workers, development of a comprehensive preparedness plan aligned with national and international guidelines, regular reporting to the Bangsamoro Parliament, activation of local health emergency response teams, coordination with national and international agencies, and mobilization of local and external resources;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to urge the Ministry of Health – BARMM to strengthen response and preparedness measures for monkeypox in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM);

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, that the Ministry of Health – BARMM be requested to submit regular situation and progress reports to the Parliament on the status of monkeypox cases and response measures; to develop a comprehensive and updated monkeypox preparedness and response plan for the Region; to ensure continuous coordination with local government units (LGUs), the Department of Health (DOH), and international health agencies, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), to mobilize resources, provide technical assistance, and ensure harmonized public health efforts; and to disseminate the public information and education campaign through various media and platforms, ensuring culturally sensitive and linguistically appropriate materials;

**RESOLVED, FINALLY**, that copies of this Resolution be furnished to the Ministry of Health – BARMM, the Office of the Chief Minister, the Department of Health, all concerned local government units and agencies, and international partners for immediate information and appropriate action.

**ADOPTED**,
