**WHEREAS**, **Item 2.2** of the said circular states that notification to the public and other forms of announcement and/or publicity for or otherwise relating to the government projects/programs/activities (PPA) shall be **made at the least possible cost**, taking into account the nature of and purposes of such notification, announcement and/or publicity, is to inform the public of the essential features/elements of the PPA;

Project Details may be omitted for PPA not exceeding 5 days; however, the start and end dates must be specified;

**WHEREAS**, **Item 2.2.6** expounds that the display and/or affixture of the picture, image, motto, logo, color motif, initials or other symbol or graphic representation associated with the top leadership of the project proponent or implementing agency/unit/office, on signboards, is considered unnecessary. This rule shall also apply to signboards displaying and/or affixed with the picture, image, motto, logo, color motif, initials or other symbol or representation associated with Members of the Congress, Executive Officials or Local Officials where the PPA is implemented wholly or partially through the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) of Congress or through other forms of government fund transfer from the Executive Department or LGUs;

**WHEREAS**, through the said circular, the public is informed of government PPAs and other initiatives through signboards, but such signboards shall comply with the requirements laid down by the circular;

**WHEREAS**, the notification to the public of the government PPAs through signboards is to inform the public of the pertinent details surrounding the PPAs of the government, being a necessary part of ensuring transparency and accountability.

**WHEREAS**, the notification to the public of the government PPAs does not serve the political agenda of a specific person or group;

**WHEREAS**, some government projects are advertised alongside the names and photos of individuals, to the extent of including life-sized signboards;

**WHEREAS**, this practice is a clear indication that there has been a poor and weak implementation of this Circular;

**WHEREAS**, this practice should not be tolerated by the Bangsamoro Government, and actions must be taken in order to stop it; and

**WHEREAS**, it is therefore incumbent for the Bangsamoro Government to remind the ministries, offices, and agencies including local government units in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of the **COA Circular 2013-004**, in order to limit the use of government funds for signboards that are unnecessary, and of which exceed the measurements and specifications allowed by the COA.
