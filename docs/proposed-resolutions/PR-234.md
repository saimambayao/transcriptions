**RESOLUTION**

**DIRECTING THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT (MILG) TO ADOPT MECHANISMS THAT WILL ENSURE OR ENCOURAGE THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BASIC SECTORS IN THE LUPONG TAGAPAMAYAPA OR “LUPON” IN EACH BARANGAY IN BARMM**

**WHEREAS**, there is an increasing recognition of the fact that good governance requires the cooperation of the various stakeholders in a community;

**WHEREAS**, a face-to-face interview with the Barangay officials of Rosary Heights XI, Rosary Heights, VII, Rosary Heights IV, Bagua II, Poblacion VIII, Rosary Heights II, Rosary Heights XIII, Rosary Heights XII, Rosary Heights VI, Tamontanka V, Rosary Heights I, Rosary Heights I, Rosary Heights III, Rosary Heights IX, Rosary Heights V, and Rosary Heights X in Cotabato City disclosed that the presence or membership of the representatives from basic sectors such as religious leaders, elders or tribal leaders, non-Muslims, women, PWDs, youth and solo parents in the Lupong Tagapamayapa positively contributed in the implementation of Barangay justice system such that disputes in each sector are usually amicably settled or resolved at the level of their representative;

**WHEREAS**, diversity in the composition of the Lupon provides for a more responsive Barangay justice system considering that sectoral representatives can be considered as repositories of unique ways, means, and perspectives that are effective in resolving a particular dispute in their respective sectors;

**WHEREAS**, Section 399, Chapter VII, Title I, Book III of the Local Government Code of 1991 provides that:

> “**SECTION 399. Lupong Tagapamayapa.** - (a) There is hereby created in each barangay a lupong tagapamayapa, hereinafter referred to as the lupon, composed of the punong barangay, as chairman and ten (10) to twenty (20) members. The lupon shall be constituted every three (3) years in the manner provided herein.”

**WHEREAS**, the number of lupon members indicated in the immediately preceding *whereas* clause can easily accommodate the basic sectors of a community;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the BTA Parliament, for the Ministry of Interior and Local Government (MILG) to adopt mechanisms that will ensure or encourage the membership of the representatives of basic sectors in the Lupong Tagapamayapa or “Lupon” in each Barangay in BARMM.

**ADOPTED,**
