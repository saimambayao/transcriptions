**RESOLUTION**
**URGING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS (ICRC), THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF RED CROSS AND RED CRESCENT SOCIETIES (IFRC), AND THE PHILIPPINE RED CROSS (PNRC) TO CONSIDER USING THE RED CRESCENT EMBLEM IN ADDITION TO THE RED CROSS EMBLEM IN THE BANGSAMORO REGION**

**WHEREAS**, the Red Cross movement began in 1863 with the founding of the International Committee for the Relief of the Wounded, now named the International Committee of the Red Cross, which was established to care for victims of battle in time of war and later created to aid in the prevention and general relief of human suffering¹;

**WHEREAS**, the Red Cross is the name used, in general, in Christian majority countries while the Red Crescent is used, in general, in Muslim dominated countries;

**WHEREAS**, the Red Crescent emblem was first used by the ICRC volunteers during the armed conflict of 1876-1878 between the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire when Ottoman soldiers refused to utilize the Red Cross and pleaded to use the Red Crescent since a cross is a symbol of Christianity and a crescent is a symbol of Islam;

**WHEREAS**, the Red Crescent is adopted in Muslim dominated countries and regions such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Türkiye, Egypt, Palestine, Tunisia, Syria, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Malaysia, and Brunei Darussalam, among others, as an emblem to symbolize a humanitarian movement in their respective nations;

**WHEREAS**, pursuant to the Regulations on the Use of the Emblem of the Red Cross or the Red Crescent by the National Societies, the purpose of the emblem is to serve as a visible sign of the protection conferred by international humanitarian law on certain persons and objects, and secondly the emblem indicates that persons or objects displaying it are linked to the Movement;

**WHEREAS**, on February 14, 1947, the Philippines proclaimed its commitment to adhere to the Geneva Red Cross Convention, which necessitated the creation of a Philippine Red Cross;

**WHEREAS**, the creation of the Philippine Red Cross was fulfilled on March 22, 1947, when Republic Act 95 was signed into law by President Manuel Roxas, from then on, it has gone through several amendments;

**WHEREAS**, the constitution provides for the adoption of the generally accepted principle of international law as part of the land which includes the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their additional protocols, and the Statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is a Muslim majority region that was created as a result of the five-decade peace process between the government of the Philippines and the Moro revolutionary movements who were aspiring for social-economic-political justice, meaningful autonomy, and self-determination;

**WHEREAS**, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies may make use of the Red Cross or the Red Crescent emblems at any time and for all their activities as provided in Section 8 of Republic Act No. 10530, otherwise known as “The Red Cross and Other Emblems Act of 2013”;

**WHEREAS**, the use of the Red Crescent emblem by the ICRC, IFRC and PRC in addition to the Red Cross emblem during humanitarian efforts in times of armed conflict and other crises in the Region is in line with the fundamental principles of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement of humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity, and universality;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the Bangsamoro Parliament to request the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), and the Philippine National Red Cross (PNRC) to consider using the Red Crescent emblem in addition to the Red Cross emblem in the Bangsamoro region;
