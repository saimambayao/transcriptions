**"A RESOLUTION RECOMMENDING TO HIS EXCELLENCY PRESIDENT FERDINAND R. MARCOS AND THE SENATE OF THE PHILIPPINES THE RESPECTIVE RATIFICATION AND LEGISLATIVE CONCURRENCE OF THE CONVENTION CONCERNING THE ELIMINATION OF VIOLENCE AND HARASSMENT IN THE WORLD OF WORK (C190)"**

WHEREAS, in 1948, the Philippines joined the International Labour Organization (ILO) and has been one of ILO's most active state-members since its membership.

WHEREAS, on June 2019, the International Labour Conference of the International Labor Organization, during its 108th session, adopted the Convention Concerning the Elimination of Violence and Harassment in the World of Work otherwise known as *C190*;

WHEREAS, the said Convention is the first international treaty to recognize the right of everyone to a world of work free from violence and harassment, including gender-based violence and harassment;

WHEREAS, the Convention provides a common framework to address violence and harassment in the world of work and protect workers regardless of contractual status. It applies to all sectors, whether public or private, both in formal and informal economy, and whether in urban or rural areas;

WHEREAS, the ratification and adoption of the Convention, will not only fortify the mandate and policy of our State to promote and protect the rights of the workers but will also contribute to UN 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda specifically on Goal 5 on Gender Equality and Goal 8 on Decent Work;

WHEREAS, the Convention, which has an international character, will likewise protect Filipino overseas workers to which many Bangsamoro constituents belong. It will also protect the workers in the informal sector which heavily comprise the Bangsamoro region’s business enterprises;

WHEREAS, the said Convention has only been ratified by 27 countries in the world and the Philippines is not among those countries who have ratified the said Convention. Hence, it is not yet binding in the Philippines.

WHEREAS, the President of the Philippines, as the head of state, is vested with the power to ratify treaties and international agreements. Moreover, Article VII, Section 21 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides that "[no] treaty or international agreement shall be valid and effective unless concurred by at least two-thirds of all the Members of the Senate.

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, through the legislative powers conferred upon it, recommends to the Honorable President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. and to the noble members of the Senate of the Philippines the respective ratification and legislative concurrence of *C190* to promote the protection of the interests of workers, and the welfare of women to enable them to achieve their full potential as equal partners of men in development.

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament to recommend to His Excellency President Ferdinand R. Marcos and the Senate of the Philippines the respective ratification and legislative concurrence of the Convention Concerning the Elimination of Violence and Harassment in the World of Work otherwise known as *C190* to become part of the laws of the land.
