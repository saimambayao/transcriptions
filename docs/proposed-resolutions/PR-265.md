**RESOLUTION**

**DIRECTING THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE, BUDGET AND MANAGEMENT (MFBM) TO APPRISE THE BANGSAMORO TRANSITION AUTHORITY (BTA) PARLIAMENT ON THE STATUS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SPECIAL DEVELOPMENT FUND (SDF), PROVIDED UNDER THE BANGSAMORO ORGANIC LAW**

**WHEREAS**, the National Government provides other sources of funds to the Bangsamoro Government to implement its development plans and programs. These other sources of funds are in addition to the Block Grant of the National Government to the Bangsamoro Government every year, effective upon operation of the Bangsamoro Government;

**WHEREAS**, one of the other funding sources is the Special Development Fund amounting to five (5) billion pesos every year in the next 10-year period from the ratification of the Organic Law as provided under Section 2, Article XIV of the Organic Law for the rebuilding, rehabilitation, and development of its conflict-affected communities;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Government, with funding support from the National Government, shall intensify development efforts for the rehabilitation, reconstruction, and the overall development of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region as part of the normalization process. Thus, the Bangsamoro Government shall formulate and implement a program for rehabilitation and development that will address the needs of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front/Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces (MILF/BIAF) members and its decommissioned women, and auxiliary force, Moro National Liberation Front/Bangsamoro Armed Forces (MNLF/BAF) members, and address the needs of internally displaced persons, widows and orphans, and poverty-stricken communities;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Parliament passed and approved the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 22, also known as An Act Appropriating the Sum of Ten Billion Pesos (P10,000,000,000.00) from the 2020 and 2021 Special Development Fund and the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 34 or An Act Extending the Availability of 2020 and 2021 Special Development Fund;

**WHEREAS**, after years of implementation of the Special Development Fund, the members of the Bangsamoro Parliament are interested to know the status of the implementation of the SDF. This is important for legislative consideration and policy formulation purposes. The implementation status should include the status of physical and financial status of the development programs and projects funded by the SDF;

**WHEREAS**, after 10 years of implementation of the Special Development Fund its performance will be the basis of what the Bangsamoro Government will do next. If the fund implementation is successful then, one of the Bangsamoro Government’s options is to request the National Government to extend the Special Development Fund for another 10 years considering that the Fund is appropriately being utilized for the continuing rehabilitation, reconstruction, and development of conflict-affected communities in Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED** by the BTA Parliament to pass and approve this Resolution directing the Ministry of Finance, Budget and Management (MFBM) to apprise the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) Parliament on the status of the implementation of the Special Development Fund, provided under the Bangsamoro Organic Law.

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, to forward this Resolution to the MFBM for information and appropriate action.
