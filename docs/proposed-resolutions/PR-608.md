> “Section 16. Integrated System of Quality Education. xxx The Bangsamoro Government shall develop an educational framework relevant and responsive to the needs, ideals, and aspirations of the Bangsamoro people. xxx”

**WHEREAS**, promoting the mother or native tongue in education supports cultural preservation and the development of a child's identity, nurturing a sense of pride and connection to their heritage;
