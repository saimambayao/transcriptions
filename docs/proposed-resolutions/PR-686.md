**A RESOLUTION URGING THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH TO STRENGTHEN PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS ON THE EXISTENCE OF THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR MENTAL HEALTH (NCMH) CRISIS HOTLINE AND BARMM CRISIS HELPLINE ACROSS BOTH ONLINE AND OFFLINE PLATFORMS**

**WHEREAS**, mental health issues continue to be a significant concern within the Bangsamoro region and across the Philippines, with numerous individuals facing challenges such as anxiety, depression, and other psychological stressors that impact their well-being;

**WHEREAS**, Republic Act No. 11036, or the Mental Health Act, mandates the establishment of a 24/7 mental health crisis hotline to assist individuals experiencing mental health conditions, particularly those at risk of self-harm or suicide;

**WHEREAS**, despite the availability of the National Center for Mental Health (NCMH) Crisis Hotline, many individuals in the Bangsamoro region remain unaware of this critical resource due to limited outreach and insufficient public awareness efforts, underscoring the urgent need to amplify the campaign for greater visibility and accessibility;

**WHEREAS**, the Ministry of Health has launched the Telepsychiatry Program for Mental Health Services to strengthen the delivery of mental health services in the region, including the rollout of the BARMM Crisis Helpline, which provides immediate support to distressed individuals;

**WHEREAS**, empirical studies highlight the effectiveness of crisis hotlines in reducing suicidality and psychological distress, with a 2010 study on suicide hotline callers in the United States showing a significant decrease in suicidal ideation and hopelessness following crisis intervention;

**WHEREAS**, in 2019, the World Health Organization reported suicide as the fourth leading cause of death among youth aged 15-29 years old, with 58% of suicide cases occurring before the age of 50;

**WHEREAS**, based on a 2021 study by the University of the Philippines Population Institute, approximately 12% of Bangsamoro youth aged 15-24 years old have thought of committing suicide, while around 3.3% to 4.8% have attempted to do so;

**WHEREAS**, despite the efforts of the Ministry of Health to raise awareness and strengthen mental health service delivery, anecdotal evidence indicates a lack of visibility and accessibility of the BARMM Crisis Helpline across online and offline platforms;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, as it hereby resolves, that the Ministry of Health strengthen public awareness campaigns on the existence of the NCMH Crisis Hotline and BARMM Crisis Helpline across both online and offline platforms;

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, that the Ministry of Health, in coordination with the Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education, shall ensure that the NCMH Crisis Hotline and the BARMM Crisis Helpline contact numbers are prominently displayed in all educational institutions in the region;

**FINALLY, RESOLVED**, that the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Interior and Local Government shall ensure that the NCMH Crisis Hotline and the BARMM Crisis Helpline contact numbers are also visibly posted in local government offices to enhance accessibility for the general public.

**ADOPTED**,
