**RESOLUTION**

**CONDEMNING IN THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE TERMS, THE ACT OF BURNING THE HOLY QUR’AN IN STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN IN TIME FOR THE CELEBRATION OF EID’L ADHA**

**WHEREAS**, Article 18, Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance;

**WHEREAS**, Section 11, Article II of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides that the State values the dignity of every human person and guarantees full respect for human rights;

**WHEREAS**, Section 5, Article III of the Constitution provides that the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship shall forever be allowed;

**WHEREAS**, Section 3, Article V of Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants;

**WHEREAS**, Section 4, Article IX of the BOL states that the customs, beliefs, and traditions of the Bangsamoro people are hereby recognized, protected, and guaranteed;

**WHEREAS**, the same article extends that the Parliament shall adopt measures to ensure mutual respect and protection of the distinct beliefs, customs, and traditions of the Bangsamoro people and the other inhabitants in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. No person in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region shall be subjected to any form of discrimination on account of creed religion, ethnic origin, parentage, or gender;

**WHEREAS**, Salwan Momika, a 37-year-old Iraqi refugee turned Swedish citizen from the Al-Hamdaniya District, east of Mosul, stomped on the Islamic holy book (Qur’an) and set several pages alight in front of the Swedish capital’s largest mosque on June 28, 2023. Additionally, Police had granted him a permit for the protest in line with free speech protections in the country¹;

**WHEREAS**, in the application for the grant of the permit, Salwan Momika explained that he wanted to express his opinion about the Qur’an by tearing it up and burning it. The police had granted a permit for the demonstration after a Swedish court ruled that banning it would impinge on the right to freedom of speech. However, the permit says that demonstrators are not allowed to burn objects in Stockholm²;

**WHEREAS**, in a report, it stated that the act of Salwan Momika was not just a symbolic gesture, as it was a deliberate and calculated move that Momika had planned and sought permission for. He was not alone during this incident as another protester was also present at the scene, translated Momika’s remarks for the crowd and the media³;

**WHEREAS**, Salwan Momika burned the holy book during Eid’l Adha, one of the biggest and significant celebrations in Islam;

**WHEREAS**, he viewed his act of burning the Qur’an as an exercise of his democratic rights and a demonstration of freedom of speech⁴;

**WHEREAS**, in an interview with CNN, he also remarked that the holy book “should be banned in the world because of the danger it causes to democracy, ethics, human values, human rights, and women’s rights. It just doesn’t work in this time and age”⁵;

**WHEREAS**, a book that is considered holy by a certain religion should be respected, and respect must also be accorded to everyone who believes in it;

**WHEREAS**, the act of burning the Qur’an did not only create an environment of fear through heightening Islamophobia, but also made a huge impact on Muslims in their free exercise of religion as it can generate false and negative perceptions of Islam;

**WHEREAS**, being fellow brothers and sisters in faith, this act affects all Muslims all over the world, including the Bangsamoro;

**WHEREAS**, this act of burning the Qur’an should not be tolerated and must be condemned in the strongest possible terms by the Bangsamoro government; and

**WHEREAS**, it is imperative for the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, as the interim government of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, to condemn and call out the act of burning the Qur’an in Stockholm, Sweden.

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the BTA Parliament, to pass and approve this Resolution Condemning in the Strongest Possible Terms the Act of Burning the Holy Qur’an in Stockholm, Sweden in Time for the Celebration of Eid’l Adha.

Adopted,
