**RESOLUTION**

**CALLING ON THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT, THE PROVINCIAL, CITY AND MUNICIPAL LEGAL OFFICERS, THE PROSECUTOR’S OFFICES AND SHARIAH COURTS IN THE BANGSAMORO REGION TO ESTABLISH A LEGAL ASSISTANCE HOTLINE OR COORDINATION SYSTEM WITH BARANGAY UNITS IN THEIR JURISDICTION TO ASSIST THE BARANGAY OFFICIALS IN IMPLEMENTING THE KATARUNGANG PAMBARANGAY LAW**

WHEREAS, the Local Government Code of 1991 recognizes judicial decentralization at the barangay level through the operation of the Barangay Justice System, unlike other local government units;

WHEREAS, Section 407 of RA 7160 provides that “the provincial, city legal Officer or prosecutor or the municipal legal officer shall render legal advice on matters involving questions of law to the punong barangay or any lupon or pangkat member whenever necessary in the exercise of his functions in the administration of the Barangay Justice System”;

WHEREAS, under the aforementioned law, the appointment of a legal officer shall be mandatory for the provincial and city governments and optional for the municipal government;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Region recognizes the impediments to peace and development, such as local armed conflicts, disputes and rido which are existing in several towns and communities in the region, hence, local conflict resolution efforts and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms are, therefore, necessary to advance peace and development activities;

WHEREAS, common issues that may confront the barangay justice systems are questions on the jurisdiction of the Barangay Justice, venue of complaints, proper designation of cases, and manner of enforcing the settlement agreements which significantly require the legal background to address the same;

WHEREAS, it has been the prevailing practice that the decisive criteria for the selection of the Lupon members are based on the traditional recognition of elders who do not necessarily possess the legal background to address the legal questions that may be brought before the Barangay;

WHEREAS, instances of cases being tossed back and forth from the Lupon and other concerned agencies and dismissal of the same in courts for the failure of the parties to comply with condition precedent occur mostly because of the failure of the Barangay to determine its jurisdiction over the complaint or for some other legal issues;

WHEREAS, the Barangay does not necessarily engage in seeking legal advice from the provincial, city legal officer or prosecutors’ offices or the municipal legal officer, or from the shariah courts to guide them in ascertaining whether or not they have jurisdiction over cases brought before the Lupon and other legal concerns primarily because of the lack of proper coordination system to facilitate the concerns and inquiries relating to Barangay Justice;

WHEREAS, a specific coordinating mechanism that serves as the locus of responsibility for the network of various government law agencies with the barangays in the region would help capacitate the Barangay Justice System in the administration of justice at the barangay level;

WHEREAS, to strengthen the implementation of section 407 of RA 7160, there is a need to establish a hotline or coordination system to link the implementors of the Barangay Justice System and certain frontline agencies such as the Ministry of Interior and Local Governance, the Prosecutors’ office, the shariah courts, and Provincial, City/Municipal Legal Officers involving questions of laws of the Barangay Justice;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED,** by the Bangsamoro Parliament, TO CALL ON THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT, THE PROVINCIAL, CITY AND MUNICIPAL LEGAL OFFICERS, THE PROSECUTOR’S OFFICES AND SHARIAH COURTS IN THE BANGSAMORO REGION TO ESTABLISH A LEGAL ASSISTANCE HOTLINE OR COORDINATION SYSTEM WITH BARANGAY UNITS IN THEIR JURISDICTION TO ASSIST THE BARANGAY OFFICIALS IN IMPLEMENTING THE KATARUNGANG PAMBARANGAY LAW;

**RESOLVED, FINALLY,** that copies of this resolution be furnished to the MILG, Prosecutor’s offices, Shariah courts, and Provincial, City, or Municipal Local Government Units for information and appropriate consideration.
