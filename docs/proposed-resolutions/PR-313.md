**RESOLUTION**

**CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY (GOTD), THROUGH THE BANGSAMORO DARUL IFTA’, AND OTHER APPROPRIATE MINISTRIES AND OFFICES, TO CONDUCT AN ANNUAL PRE-RAMADHAN SYMPOSIUM AND PRODUCE APPROPRIATE MODULES FOR IT TO EDUCATE AND REMIND THE BANGSAMORO PEOPLE ABOUT THE VIRTUE OF THE HOLY MONTH OF RAMADHAN**

**WHEREAS,** Allah almighty said in the Holy Qur’an in Surah Al-Baqarah Verse 185, that “the month of Ramadhan [is that] in which was revealed the Qur’an, a guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and criterion. So, whoever sights [the crescent of] the month, let him fast it, and whoever is ill or on a journey - then an equal number of other days. Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship and [wants] for you to complete the period and to glorify Allah for that [to] which He has guided you, and perhaps you will be grateful.”

**WHEREAS,** in another verse, Allah told us to “remind, for indeed, the reminder benefits the believers.” (Surah Ad-Dhairyat, 51:55);

**WHEREAS,** Section 5, Article III of the 1987 Constitution guarantees “The free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, xxx.”;

**WHEREAS,** Section 59, Chapter 5, Title II of the Bangsamoro Administrative Code mandates the Bangsamoro Darul-Ifta’ “to strengthen Islamic preaching and guidance, and utilize the knowledge and social capital of the Ulama for the common good”;

**WHEREAS,** Muslims around the world celebrate annually the holy month of Ramadhan, the ninth month in the Islamic Hijrah calendar, where they are enjoined to fast and perform good deeds for the entire month of Ramadan;

**WHEREAS,** during this holy month, every able Muslim body is obliged not only to fast but to perform as many good deeds as possible to attain more rewards and mercy of Allahu Subhana wa Taala;

**WHEREAS,** to perform such noble acts of worship, it would be beneficial at the start of Ramadhan for every Muslim believer, men, and women, young and old, to know and be reminded of the obligatory duties, highly recommended deeds, and other permissible acts to be performed during this holy month;

**WHEREAS,** acknowledging the fact that not every Bangsamoro has attended proper Islamic education or has sufficient Islamic knowledge or background, it is in everybody’s best interest for the Bangsamoro Government Institutions, like the Darul Ifta and other concerned ministries or agencies to consider initiating programs like the conduct of Islamic Symposium to help address the lack of basic Islamic knowledge of the Bangsamoro constituencies especially on the basic pillar of Islam, that include fasting in the month of Ramadhan;

**WHEREAS,** the holding of Islamic symposiums and lecture series and the development of modules on the virtues of and practices during Ramadhan will greatly benefit everyone in the region relative to their acts of worship and likewise strengthen the role of Darul Iftah’ as a regional religious institution;

**WHEREAS,** the Offices of Darul Ifta and the Regional Mufti shall take advantage of social media by live-streaming their lecture series, symposiums, and seminars and also utilize other media of information;

**WHEREAS,** these activities can be incorporated into the gender and development plans of all ministries, agencies, and offices and also as part of the current government’s advocacy of moral governance;

**WHEREAS,** the offices of the Bangsamoro Darul Ifta’ as an Islamic advisory council, is the appropriate institution to carry the mandate on this matter and the most qualified to develop modules and instructional materials; and to hold or conduct lectures, seminars, and symposiums;

**NOW, THEREFORE,** be it **RESOLVED,** as it is **HEREBY RESOLVED,** by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY (GOTD), THROUGH THE BANGSAMORO DARUL IFTA’, AND OTHER APPROPRIATE MINISTRIES AND OFFICES, TO CONDUCT AN ANNUAL PRE-RAMADHAN SYMPOSIUM AND PRODUCING APPROPRIATE MODULES FOR IT TO EDUCATE AND REMIND THE BANGSAMORO PEOPLE ABOUT THE VIRTUE OF THE HOLY MONTH OF RAMADHAN;

**RESOLVED FURTHER,** copies of this resolution be furnished to the Darul Ifta of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao and other concerned Ministries or offices for information and appropriate consideration.
