**RESOLUTION CALLING ON THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS AND HIGHWAYS NATIONAL THRU DPWH-BARMM AND MINISTRY OF PUBLIC WORKS-BARMM TO IMPROVE, UPGRADE AND RECONSTRUCT ALL BRIDGES LOCATED WITHIN THE BARMM REGION**

**WHEREAS,** according to the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao's (BARMM) Rapid Emergency Action on Disaster Incidence (READi), significant flooding in Maguindanao provinces and Cotabato City caused by Typhoon Paeng (International Name: Nalgae) has affected at least 578,258 people, placing the entire province of Maguindanao under a state of calamity;

**WHEREAS,** the flooding, the worst to batter the autonomous Muslim territory in recent years, devastated at least 305 Barangays in the BARMM Region, the two Maguindanao provinces, the Special Geographic Area, and Lanao del Sur;

**WHEREAS,** floods in Maguindanao del Norte and Maguindanao del Sur had damaged and destroyed at least three bridges. The Darapanan Bridge in Sultan Kudarat town, the Nituan Bridge in Parang, the Labu-Labu 1 Bridge in Datu Hoffer, the Oring Bridge in Buldon, and the Kusiong-Tapian Bridge in Datu Odin Sinsuat were all destroyed by flood waters.;

**WHEREAS,** because of the tremendous consequences of tropical storm Paeng, inhabitants' everyday transit has been severely impacted, particularly those who reside in locations where bridges have been damaged. As a result of the difficulty in reaching out to typhoon victims, relief operations from local government authorities and the private sectors are hampered;

**WHEREAS,** the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) BARMM is in charge of public works matters in the Bangsamoro, including the construction and maintenance of infrastructure linked to roads, ports, flood control and shore protection, and water resource development systems;

Through a separate memorandum of agreement (MOA), the Department of Public Works and Highways(DPWH) may assign the Ministry of Public Works-BARMM minor maintenance tasks and emergency response;

**WHEREAS,** given that the BARMM Region is far behind in the upscale upgrading of bridges and highways across the country, it is high time that we improve, upgrade, and reconstruct bridges in the BARMM region;

**WHEREAS,** we draw on the Department of Public Works and Highways' (DPWH) attention via the Ministry of Public Works-BARMM to the need to identify infrastructure projects and improve, upgrade, and reconstruct all bridges located in the BARMM Region;

**WHEREAS,** the Ministry of Public Works-BARMM must uphold its commitment to provide the highest quality infrastructure facilities and services to the inhabitants of the BARMM Region, including necessary facilitation and follow-up to the DPWH-National;

**NOW, THEREFORE,** be it resolved, and it is hereby resolved, to request the DPWH-National thru DPWH-BARMM and MPW-BARMM to identify, improve and reconstruct all bridges located within the BARMM Region;

**IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED FURTHER** that this resolution be forwarded to the Office of the Chief Minister, Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, Honorable Ahod B. Ebrahim, the Ministry of Public Works-BARMM and the Department of Public Works and Highways for their kind consideration and approval.
