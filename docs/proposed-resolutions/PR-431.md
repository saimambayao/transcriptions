**WHEREAS**, sometime in May 2022, a consultation was conducted with the internally displaced persons (IDPs) of Marawi City where they have articulated as a common issue of the IDP communities living in transitory and permanent shelters located in the outskirts of Marawi City the high cost of transportation within and around the city which adversely affected their mobility and access to basic services;

**WHEREAS**, some residents of Marawi City recently expressed through social media their sentiments on the alleged overcharging of fares by public conveyances carrying passengers within or outside the city to the detriment of the commuting sector including persons with disabilities, senior citizens, and students;

**WHEREAS**, a recent survey with the drivers and/or operators of public utility vehicles (PUVs) operating in Marawi City, including tricycles (pedicabs) and bajaj three-wheelers, revealed that these public utility vehicles charged high transport fares as a result of the pandemic, inflation, fuel price hike, transport terminal fees, among others;

**WHEREAS**, said survey showed that PUVs, including tricycles and bajaj three-wheelers, charged the following fares:

| Public Conveyance | Fare | Destination |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Tricycle | **PHP 20.00 to PHP 130.00** for one or two passengers depending on the location and destination | Within Marawi City |
| Multicab with a maximum capacity of fifteen (15) passengers | **PHP 40.00 to PHP 75.00** each | From Marawi City to nearby municipalities |

| Registered/colorum four-wheeled vehicle with a maximum capacity of six (6) passengers | **PHP 150.00 to PHP 300.00** each | From Marawi City to other municipalities in Lanao del Sur |
| Bajaj three-wheeler with a maximum capacity of five (5) passengers | **PHP 25.00 each** | Within Marawi City |

**WHEREAS**, fare matrices for public conveyances operating in Marawi City are yet to be issued by the transportation authorities of the Bangsamoro Government;

**WHEREAS**, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) is the primary policy, planning, programming, coordinating, implementing, regulating, and administrative entity of the Bangsamoro Government in the promotion, development, and regulation of dependable and coordinated networks of transportation and communications systems, as well as fast, safe, efficient, and reliable transportation services.¹

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (BLTFRB), as a sectoral office of the MOTC, exercises the following powers and functions, among others:
a) Prescribe and regulate routes and areas of operation of public land transportation services within the Bangsamoro region through franchises or provisional permits;
b) Promulgate rules and regulations, including standards and safety requirements, for land transportation utilities operating in the Bangsamoro region, consistent with existing laws and national policies; and
c) Determine reasonable fares, rates, and other related charges relative to the operation of public land transportation services within the Bangsamoro region²;

**WHEREAS**, cities and municipalities, through their sanggunians, are empowered to regulate the operation of tricycles and grant franchises for the operation thereof within their territorial jurisdictions;³

**WHEREAS**, Executive Order No. 712 was issued on 11 March 2008 directing the immediate review of existing orders, rules, and regulations issued by local government units concerning public transportation, including the grant of franchise to tricycles, establishment and operation of transport terminals, authority to issue traffic citation tickets, and unilateral rerouting schemes of PUVs;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, that the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) Parliament, in aid of formulating regional legislation, policies, and guidelines on matters relative to land transportation, **URGES THE APPROPRIATE COMMITTEE IN THE PARLIAMENT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MINISTRY OF TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TO LOOK INTO THE ALLEGED OVERCHARGING OF FARES BY PUVs OPERATING WITHIN AND OUTSIDE MARAWI CITY AND TO REVIEW EXISTING ISSUANCES OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OF MARAWI SEEKING TO REGULATE: a) THE OPERATION OF AND GRANT OF FRANCHIES TO TRICYCLES (PEDICABS) AND SIMILAR CONVEYANCES; and (b) THE ESTABLISHMENT AND OPERATION OF TRANSPORT TERMINALS THEREIN;**

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, that the same exercise should be expanded to other areas of the Bangsamoro Region in Muslim Mindanao in order to **PRESCRIBE AND REGULATE ROUTES AND AREAS OF OPERATION OF PUVs IN OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE REGION, DETERMINE REASONABLE FARES THEREFOR, AND ISSUE CORRESPONDING FARE MATRICES FOR THE GUIDANCE OF THE PUVs;**

**RESOLVED, FINALLY**, that a Copy of this Resolution be furnished the Office of the President of the Philippines, and the Office of the Chief Minister.
