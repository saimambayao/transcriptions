**RESOLUTION RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT TO INCLUDE THE PROVINCE OF SULU IN ITS BUDGET PREPARATION FOR FISCAL YEAR 2026**

**WHEREAS**, Article X, **Section 20** of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides that the organic act of an autonomous region shall grant the regional government legislative powers over matters such as administrative organization, sources of revenues, economic and social development, and other matters for the promotion of the general welfare of the people in the region;

**WHEREAS**, **Section 6**, Article XII of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, affirms the fiscal autonomy of the Bangsamoro Government by granting it the power to create its own sources of revenues and to levy taxes, fees, and charges, in accordance with the Constitution and national laws;

**WHEREAS**, **Section 19**, Article XII of the same law provides that the Bangsamoro Parliament shall enact an annual appropriations law allocating the annual block grant and other sources of funds to the various ministries, agencies, and offices, including their respective programs;

**WHEREAS**, **Section 28**, Article XII further authorizes the Bangsamoro Government to determine the form, content, and manner of preparation of its own budget through a law to be enacted by the Bangsamoro Parliament, thereby vesting full authority in the regional government to plan and prepare its budget in accordance with the needs and priorities of its people;

**WHEREAS**, consistent with these provisions, it is within the powers of the Bangsamoro Government to include in its budget preparation process all offices, programs, and personnel under its funding coverage, including those operating in areas like the Province of Sulu, where administrative and operational transition remains unresolved;

**WHEREAS**, by virtue of the Supreme Court Decision and Resolution dated September 9, 2024, and November 26, 2024, respectively, the Province of Sulu has been excluded from the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), but is presently not under the jurisdiction of any specific administrative region;

**WHEREAS**, the Province of Sulu continues to rely on the Bangsamoro Government for the funding of various ministries, commissions, offices, and personnel stationed therein;

**WHEREAS**, as emphasized in the Supreme Court Resolution dated November 26, 2024, appropriate mechanisms must be applied to validate, adapt, or conclude ongoing projects and programs in a manner that minimizes potential disruptions to the public interest, maintains institutional stability, and protects the welfare of the people of Sulu;

**WHEREAS**, in the absence of formal reorganization under an executive issuance of the President or an enabling act of Congress, no other regional agency or administrative body has yet assumed fiscal or administrative responsibility over the provincial offices, employees, or programs previously supported by the Bangsamoro Government;

**WHEREAS**, failure to include the Province of Sulu in the Bangsamoro Government’s budget preparation for Fiscal Year 2026 may result in material disruption of public services, insecurity of employment for affected workers, and instability in the delivery of vital programs and essential government functions;

**WHEREAS**, the inclusion of Sulu in the regional budget preparation process, in the absence of an official transfer or a carefully executed administrative reorganization, is a practical and necessary measure to protect the welfare of Tausug employees, uphold continuity in governance, and ensure the equitable use of public funds;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved, by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, in session duly assembled, to respectfully request the Bangsamoro Government to include the various provincial offices of the different ministries, commissions, and other agencies in the Province of Sulu in the region’s budget preparation for Fiscal Year 2026, including the proposed allocation of funds for public servants, programs, activities, and projects currently being implemented in the province;

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, that a copy of this resolution be furnished to the Office of the Chief Minister, the Ministry of Finance, Budget and Management (MFBM), and all other concerned agencies for their appropriate information and action.

**ADOPTED**, ____________, 2025.
