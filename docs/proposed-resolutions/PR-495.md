**WHEREAS,** Section 32, Chapter IX, Book I of Executive Order No. 292, or The Administrative Code of 1987, specifically provides that "*Public office is a public trust. Public officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with the utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency, act within patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives*";

**WHEREAS,** Section 33, Chapter V, Book V of the same law provides that "*there shall be established a performance evaluation system, which shall be administered in accordance with rules, regulations and standards promulgated by the Commission for all officers and employees in the career service. Such performance evaluation system shall be administered in such manner as to continually foster the improvement of individual employee efficiency and organizational effectiveness*";

**WHEREAS,** Section 5 of Administrative Order No. 241, Series of 2008, provides that "*agencies shall institute a Performance Evaluation System based on objectively measured output and performance of personnel and units, such as the Performance Management System - Office Performance Evaluation System developed by the CSC*";

**WHEREAS,** Section 13, Chapter 1, Title XVIII of the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 13, or the Bangsamoro Administrative Code (BAC), provides that, in line with the policies of the Civil Service Commission (CSC), all Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) ministries, agencies, and offices shall adopt a Strategic Performance Management System (SPMS) geared towards continuously fostering improvement of organizational performance, employee effectiveness and efficiency, and provision of an objective performance rating at individual and team levels as basis for performance appraisal and recognition;

**WHEREAS,** the Civil Service Commission (CSC) is the central personnel agency of the Government that is mandated by law to promulgate policies, standards, and guidelines to effectively administer the civil service;

**WHEREAS,** two of the mandated functions of the CSC under Executive Order No. 292 are the following:

1. To promulgate policies, standards and guidelines for the Civil Service and adopt plans and programs to promote economical, efficient and effective personnel administration in the government; and

2. To formulate, administer and evaluate programs relative to the development and retention of qualified and competent work force in the public service¹;

**WHEREAS,** the Civil Service Commission has issued Memorandum Circular No. 6, Series of 2012, and has promulgated in CSC Resolution No. 1200481, dated March 12, 2012, which outlines the guidelines in the establishment and implementation of agency Strategic Performance and Management System (SPMS);

**WHEREAS,** the SPMS is focused on linking individual performance vis-à-vis the agency’s organizational vision, mission, and strategic goals. It is a mechanism that ensures that the employee achieves the objectives set by the organization and the organization, on the other hand, achieves the objectives that it has set itself in its strategic plan²;

**WHEREAS,** the performance management system is the heart of the human resource system because information produced from it is useful in human resource planning, management, and decision-making processes³;

**WHEREAS,** the guidelines outlined in CSC Resolution No. 1200481, Series of 2012, provide in Paragraph A in Item V, that employees who obtained **Unsatisfactory** rating for one rating period or exhibited poor performance shall be provided appropriate developmental intervention by the Head of Office and Supervisor (Division/Unit Head), in coordination with the Human Resource Management Office or Personnel Office, to address competency-related performance gaps⁴;

**WHEREAS,** the CSC promulgated on July 3, 2017 the 2017 Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (2017 RACCS) which provides, specifically in Section 107 Rule 20, that officers and employees who are absent without approved leave, **have unsatisfactory or performance**, or have shown to be physically or mentally unfit to perform their duties may be dropped from the rolls within thirty (30) days from the time a ground therefor arises;

**WHEREAS,** Paragraph B, Section 107, Rule 20 of the 2017 RACCS provides that an employee who obtained **Unsatisfactory rating** for one rating period or exhibited poor performance within the first three (3) months of the rating period shall be provided appropriate developmental intervention by the Head of Office and Supervisor (Division/Unit Head), in coordination with the Human Resource Management Office/Personnel, to address competency-related performance gaps;

**WHEREAS,** Rule 20 of the 2017 RACCS states that if after advice and provision of developmental intervention, and an employee still obtains **Poor Rating** for the remaining months of the rating period or **Unsatisfactory Rating** in the immediately succeeding rating period, he/she may be dropped from the rolls;

**WHEREAS,** Rule 20 of 2017 RACCS further states that:

**b. Unsatisfactory or Poor Performance**

2. An officer or employee who is given **two consecutive Unsatisfactory ratings may be dropped from the rolls after due notice**. Notice shall mean that the officer or employee concerned is informed in writing of his/her unsatisfactory performance for a semester and is sufficiently warned that a succeeding unsatisfactory performance may warrant his/her dropping from the rolls. Such notice shall be given not later than thirty (30) days from the end of the semester and shall contain sufficient information which shall enable the officer or employee to prepare an explanation within reasonable period specified in the notice.

**WHEREAS,** it is imperative for all ministries, offices, and agencies within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region to be aware of these CSC Rules and Regulations, thereby ensuring that the workforce of the Bangsamoro Government remains efficient, productive, and committed to delivering quality public service to the Bangsamoro people;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED,** by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) Parliament to pass and approved this Resolution Reminding the Ministries, Offices, Agencies and Local Government Units in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) of the Civil Service Commission (CSC) Rules and Regulations on Consequences of Two (2) Consecutive Unsatisfactory Performance Rating in Meeting Performance Targets;
