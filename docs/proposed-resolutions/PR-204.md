**WHEREAS**, it is provided further under Section 2 of R.A. 10121 or the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010 that: “It shall be the policy of the state to: xxx (p) ***Provide maximum care, assistance and services to individuals and families affected by disaster, implement emergency rehabilitation projects to lessen the impact of disaster***, and facilitate resumption of normal social and economic activities.”

**WHEREAS**, under Rule XII, Section 14 of Resolution No. 268 or the Resolution Providing for Rules, Procedures, and Practices of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, it provides that:

**WHEREAS**, based on the data released by Bangsamoro Disaster Risk Reduction Management Committee (BDRRMC) on November 4, 2022, Tropical Storm Paeng left the Bangsamoro Region with 570,285 individuals affected, including 53 death casualties, 12 missing, and 38 injured.

**WHEREAS**, this resolution intends to, by some means, pave the way in freeing the Bangsamoro people from poverty by providing social services which would lessen the impact of the disaster, and ensure the rehabilitation of calamity-affected areas and victims of calamities as they are the ones who need the immediate action and concern of the government, particularly those who were deprived of their homes as it is one of the most basic needs of a human being for survival.
