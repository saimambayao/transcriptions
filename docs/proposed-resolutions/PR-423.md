**WHEREAS**, Section 2 (c) Article V of Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law, states that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise its authority over agriculture, livestock, and food security;

**WHEREAS**, Section 1 Title 1 under Book VI of the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act (BAA) No. 13 or otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Administrative Code emphasizes the importance of food security in the development of the communities in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. It states that "*it is the policy of the Bangsamoro Government to ensure resiliency and productivity for food security, income, and rural employment in an enabling environment for farmers, fisherfolks, and agrarian reform beneficiaries*";

**WHEREAS**, the Philippine Government issued Executive Order No. 101 on the Creation of the Inter-Agency Task on Zero Hunger, which is mentioned in Section 2 that "*the Task Force shall ensure that government policies, initiatives, and projects on attaining zero hunger shall be coordinated, responsive, and effective*" and the Section 4 stated "*Local Government Units are enjoined to render such necessary assistance to the Task Force in the implementation of this Order*";

**WHEREAS**, on December 20, 2022, Chief Minister Ahod Balawag Ebrahim signed Executive Order No. 0010 renaming the Bangsamoro Food Sufficiency Task Force into the Bangsamoro Food Security Task Force;

**WHEREAS**, based on the 2019 World Bank and UNICEF Survey results in BARMM, the stunting prevalence rate for under-five children is at 39.1% (approximately 260,000 children), wasting at 10.0% (approximately 62,000 children), and underweight is at 22.6% compared to national results, continue to be a serious concern in the region;

**WHEREAS**, the Food Security status of BARMM based on the 2019 Expanded National Nutrition Survey recorded 34.7% of total households suffering from moderate food insecurity and 29.1% of family households were not able to meet their basic food needs;

**WHEREAS**, in order to be consistent and contribute to the national and regional agenda, there is a need for the local government units to carefully coordinate, support, allocate funds, monitor, and evaluate all efforts to ensure the whole government approach to eradicate hunger and malnutrition in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS**, thus, there is a need to create an Anti-Hunger and Malnutrition Task Force at the local level to ensure effective implementation and cascading of programs, projects, and activities of the Bangsamoro Food Security and Nutrition Plan 2023-2028 and Regional Plan of Action for Nutrition 2023-2028, in line with the Philippine Plan of Action for Nutrition and Philippine Multi-Sectoral nutrition project, and the Philippine Anti-Zero Hunger Program.

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED** to strongly urge the Bangsamoro Government to create the Anti-Hunger and Malnutrition Task Force of the Local Government Units in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

**ADOPTED.**
