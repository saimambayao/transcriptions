**A RESOLUTION URGING OFFICE OF SENIOR CITIZEN’S AFFAIRS (OSCAs) OF BARMM MUNICIPALITIES AND CITIES THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT (MILG) TO INCLUDE IN ITS LIST OR DATABASE THE SKILLS PROFILE OF SENIOR CITIZENS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CITIES OR MUNICIPALITIES**

**WHEREAS,** under Republic Act (RA) No. 7432, as amended by RA No. 9257 and RA No. 9994, also known as “An Act to Maximize the Contribution of Senior Citizens to Nation Building, Grant Benefits and Special Privileges and for Other Purposes” one of the state principles declared therein is ““(a) To recognize the rights of senior citizens to take their proper place in society and make it a concern of the family, community, and government; (b) To give full support to the improvement of the total well-being of the elderly and their full participation in society, considering that senior citizens are integral part of Philippine society; (c) To motivate and encourage the senior citizens to contribute to nation building; xxx ”

**WHEREAS,** the same Act aims to “(1) establish mechanisms whereby the contribution of the senior citizens are maximized (2) adopt measures whereby our senior citizens are assisted and appreciated by the community as a whole and (3) establish a program beneficial to the senior citizens, their families and the rest of the community that they serve” xxx;

**WHEREAS,** the amended law recognizes the contributions of senior citizens despite their advanced age as provided under RA No. 9257, viz:

“SEC. 3. Contribution to the Community. — Any qualified senior citizen as determined by the Office for Senior Citizens Affairs (OSCA) may render his/her services to the community which shall consist of, but not limited to, any of the following:

(a) Tutorial and/or consultancy services;
(b) Actual teaching and demonstration of hobbies and income generating skills;
(c) Lectures on specialized fields like agriculture, health, environmental protection and the like;
(d) The transfer of new skills acquired by virtue of their training mentioned in Section 4, paragraph (d); and
(e) Undertaking other appropriate services as determined by the Office for Senior Citizens Affairs (OSCA) such as school traffic guide, tourist aide, pre-school assistant, etc.

**WHEREAS,** under Section 6 of RA No. 9994, the OSCA shall have the following functions:
(a) To plan, implement and monitor yearly work programs in pursuance of the objectives of this Act;
**(b) To draw up a list of available and required services which can be provided by the senior citizens;**
**(c) To maintain and regularly update on a quarterly basis the list of senior citizens and to issue national individual identification cards, free of charge, which shall be valid anywhere in the country;**
(d) To serve as a general information and liaison center for senior citizens;
(e) To monitor compliance of the provisions of this Act particularly the grant of special discounts and privileges to senior citizens;
(f) To report to the mayor, any individual, establishments, business entity, institutions or agency found violating any provision of this Act; and
(g) To assist the senior citizens in filing complaints or charges against any individual, establishments, business entity, institution, or agency refusing to comply with the privileges under this Act before the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Provincial Prosecutor’s Office, the regional or the municipal trial court, the municipal trial court in cities, or the municipal circuit trial court." **(emphasis supplied)**

**WHEREAS,** most senior citizens, including those who have retired from full-time employment, still have their faculties and skills intact and can still be productive members of society;

**WHEREAS,** studies show that more than half of the Filipino elderly currently worked for a living, the main household income earner and owned the house and land that they were currently residing in. Majority of them do not view themselves as a “burden” to the society and have high regard for themselves.¹

**WHEREAS,** studies show that the elderly values their independence--not to pursue an individualized identity but to fulfill obligations to their family. ² The following are the key factors informing the elderly’s perspectives on independence: (1) ensuring physical health, (2) maintaining mental capacity (which includes not burdening others, gaining control, and having a right to make decisions) (3) maintaining social relationships with others, (4) being financially stable by having a table source of income, and (5) being spiritually connected by maintaining religious practices.³ Most, if not all of these factors can be addressed by having a regular or semi-regular activity or occupation as appropriate to their level of energy and state of health.

**WHEREAS,** senior citizens who are retirees have an entire lifetime of knowledge and skills that could be imparted to the younger generation;

**WHEREAS,** in many places in the BARMM, skilled and experienced mentors and coaches are highly needed;

**WHEREAS,** such gap, between the available skills that are held by senior citizens, and the need for such skills could be bridged by having a local database of senior citizens’ skillset readily available for those who need it;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,** AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED by the BTA Parliament, to pass this resolution urging local Office of Senior Citizen’s Affairs through the Ministry of the Interior and Local Government, to include in its databases of senior citizens, such skills profile and other credentials for the purpose of facilitating skills-matching between senior citizens and those seeking such services, subject to data protection laws;

**BE IT FINALLY BE RESOLVED,** that the Statutory Committee on Local Government be provided a report within ninety (90) days detailing the measures undertaken by the Ministry in furtherance of this resolution.
