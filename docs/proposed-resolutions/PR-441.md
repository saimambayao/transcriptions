**WHEREAS**, Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991, mandates the city government to provide social welfare services to its constituents including the alleviation of their problems and improve their living conditions;

**WHEREAS**, recently on 12 October 2022, the City Mayor of LGU Marawi, Atty. Majul U.
