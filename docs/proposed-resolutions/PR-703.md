**RESOLUTION URGING THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENERGY (MENRE) TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A COMPREHENSIVE MULTI-STAKEHOLDER ACTION PLAN ON FOREST PROTECTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE BANGSAMORO REGION**

**WHEREAS**, Article II, Section 16 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution declares that “the State shall protect and advance the right of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology in accord with the rhythm and harmony of nature,” thereby recognising the protection of the environment as a fundamental constitutional right of every Filipino, including those in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS**, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)¹—particularly Goal 13 (Climate Action) and Goal 15 (Life on Land)—as well as the Paris Agreement² and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to which the Philippines is a signatory, compel local and national governments to develop sustainable, inclusive, and climate-resilient strategies, including forest protection and environmental law enforcement;

**WHEREAS**, Section 10, Article III of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) affirms the responsibility of the Bangsamoro Government to protect the environment and ensure the right of its people to a balanced and healthful ecology, consistent with the Constitution and in harmony with customary laws, cultures, and practices;

**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Article XIII of the BOL also provides that the development of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region shall be carefully planned with due regard to ecological balance and the sustainable use of natural resources for both present and future generations. It further mandates the Bangsamoro Government to promote the effective use of economic resources and to pursue economic development that fosters growth, full employment, human development, and social justice;

**WHEREAS**, resilience of BARMM communities, climate change adaptation, strengthen environment and natural resources protection, conservation, rehabilitation, and management, strict enforcement of laws and the enhancement of socially-cohesive development initiatives are among the core priorities of the BARMM espoused in the 12-point priority agenda of the Government of the day;

**WHEREAS**, as a newly established regional government, the BARMM envisions and supports strategies that promote the sustainable use of natural resources, protect ecological integrity, ensure a clean and healthy environment, and pursue energy security without compromising existing ecosystems;

**WHEREAS**, Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 31 otherwise known as the "Bangsamoro Sustainable Development Board Act of 2022" enacted by the Bangsamoro Parliament on June 23, 2022 advocated for social justice and well-being where people themselves, through participatory processes, should be fully committed to support sustainable development activities by fostering equity in access to resources and the benefits derived from them;

**WHEREAS**, taking into considerations the current threats to BARMM's environment and natural resources and without definite and concrete multi-stakeholders' strategies to ensure ecological integrity and resilience of the BARMM against natural hazards like typhoons, landslides, soil erosion, storm surges and other natural calamities, BARMM communities will continue to suffer its destructive effect and will cause massive displacement of families and economic disruption;

**WHEREAS**, these natural threats are exacerbated by unabated illegal timber-poaching/logging, unregulated and unimpeded land conversion, improper solid waste management and disposal, unregulated charcoal production and illegal settlements in declared protected areas, are some if not among the attributable factors to the risk vulnerability of the BARMM to natural hazards;

**WHEREAS**, figures from three (3) year historical performance of the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources and Energy from 2022-2024 on the number of apprehended illegally transported forest products showed an annual average of about 26,010 board feet of forest products apprehended. While the number seems to be minimal and the primary reason might be the lack of strategic checkpoints on "hotspot" areas of the BARMM, one can only infer that there is a need to revisit the Ministry's strategies on how to address and abate these illegal timber-poaching activities before these "illegal forest product "can be transported;

**WHEREAS**, data also revealed that out of the One hundred Nineteen (119) BARMM Local Government Units around Fifty-three (53) of these LGUs or barely 44% managed to complete their 10-Year Solid Waste Management Plan, a very important document required under Republic Act No. 9003 or otherwise known as the "Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000";

**WHEREAS**, MENRE has successfully deployed approximately 600 Palaw Rangers, composed of awaiting decommissioned BIAF-MILF combatants, to guard 668,000 hectares of forest lands against fire, pest, and diseases. The ratio for every Palaw Ranger is 1:2,500 hectares per ranger, highlighting a crucial but insufficient enforcement capacity;

**WHEREAS**, recognizing that the BARMM among other regions of the country is "vulnerable to the impact of climate change, as manifested by recurring natural calamities such as flash floods, soil erosion and landslides in low lying areas that have displaced families and destroyed properties". Thus, to address this threat of climate change, the BARMM must planned to build resilience in communities, achieve ecological integrity, ensure clean and healthy and attain energy security through the adoption of plan of action towards intensified, sustained and participative multi-sectoral participation on forest protection and law enforcement activities in BARMM forestlands;

**WHEREAS**, to complement ecological integrity of the BARMM, it must intensify campaign against all forms of illegal logging/timber-poaching activities by working continuously with its counterpart in respective Anti-Illegal Logging Task Forces in the apprehension, seizure and prosecution of all forms of illegal logging/timber poaching activities including the filing of appropriate cases to forest offenders.

**WHEREAS**, a sustained policy enforcement and support to the efforts of the Anti-illegal logging task forces and teams is necessary to complement the efforts of forest protection and law enforcement activities. It shall provide policy revisits and review as to the strength and limitations of the existing ENR laws, rules and regulations and suggest ways forward for the appropriate action of the field implementers.

**WHEREAS**, to ensure sustainability, it shall endeavor to solicit the support and commitment of major stakeholders and communities inside forestlands to act and serve as "social fencers" in these areas to deter and report forest crimes;.

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, to urge the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources and Energy (MENRE) to develop and implement a comprehensive, time-bound, and multi-stakeholder action plan on forest protection and environmental law enforcement in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

The action plan shall include but not be limited to: forest surveillance systems (e.g., drone monitoring and satellite mapping), strengthened local enforcement capacity, sustainable livelihood alternatives, community monitoring incentives, public awareness campaigns, and a performance reporting system to be submitted to the Parliament.

**BE IT RESOLVED FURTHER**, that MENRE shall submit the said action plan to the Parliament within ninety (90) days from adoption of this Resolution and provide periodic progress reports thereafter.

**BE IT RESOLVED FINALLY**, that copies of this Resolution be furnished to the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources and Energy, the Office of the Chief Minister, and relevant ministries and civil society partners for their appropriate action and support.

Adopted,
