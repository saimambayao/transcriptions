**A RESOLUTION**
**REQUESTING THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (CSC-BARMM) TO DEVISE A MECHANISM THAT WILL PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYONE TO TAKE THE CIVIL SERVICE EXAMINATION (CSE)**

**WHEREAS,** Section 9, Article II of the 1987 Constitution provides that the State shall promote a just and dynamic social order that will ensure the prosperity and independence of the nation and free the people from poverty through policies that provide adequate social services, promote full employment, a rising standard of living, and an improved quality of life for all;

**WHEREAS,** Section 3, Article IX (B) of the 1987 Constitution, provides that the Civil Service Commission, as the central personnel agency of the Government, shall establish a career service and adopt measures to promote morale, efficiency, integrity, responsiveness, progressiveness, and courtesy in the civil service. It shall strengthen the merit and rewards system, integrate all human resources development programs for all levels and ranks, and institutionalize a management climate conducive to public accountability…;

**WHEREAS,** consistent with this, Executive Order No. 292 or the Administrative Code of 1987 provides that the Career Service shall be characterized by, among others, “entrance based on merit and fitness to be determined as far as practicable by competitive examination”;

**WHEREAS,** under Book V, Title I, Subtitle A, Chapter 3, Section 12 of the Administrative Code of 1987, the Civil Service Commission (CSC), as the central personnel agency of the government, is mandated to “control, supervise, and coordinate Civil Service Examinations” and “prescribe all forms of Civil Service examinations, appointments, report, and such other forms as may be required by law, rules and regulations”;

**WHEREAS,** this Resolution is with due respect to and recognizes the authority of the CSC as an independent Constitutional body. Under Section 2, Article V of R.A. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), it is provided that “[t]he Bangsamoro Government shall exercise its authority over the civil service without prejudice to the overall supervision of the President of the Philippines.”;

**WHEREAS,** Section 39, Article VII of the BOL states that:

“The Civil Service Commission shall establish a regional Civil Service field office and other field offices as may be needed in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region for the efficient performance of its powers and duties.

The Bangsamoro Government shall enact a civil service law: *Provided*, That it shall be in accordance with existing national laws. In case of conflict with the national laws, the Constitution and existing national civil service laws, rules, and regulations shall prevail.

This law shall govern the conduct of civil servants, the qualifications for nonelective positions, adopt the merit and fitness system, and protect civil service eligible in various government positions, including government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. The Bangsamoro Government shall have disciplinary authority over its own officials and employees;”

**WHEREAS,** the Civil Service Exam (CSE), also known as the Career Service Examination, is conducted twice a year by the Civil Service Commission (CSC) to determine whether or not an applicant is a career service eligible, or qualified to work permanently in government service;

**WHEREAS,** to take the exam, one must personally file the Civil Service Exam application at the CSC Regional Office (CSCRO), or at any of the CSC RO’S Field Offices where one intends to take the examination;

**WHEREAS,** the acceptance of applications is on a first-come, first-served basis and shall close any time once the CSC Regional/Field Office (CSC RO/FO) has reached its target number of applicants;

**WHEREAS,** because of the pandemic and to comply with minimum health standards, the number of applicants has been reduced because of the lowered number of people who may occupy seats in their assigned room in the designated testing center. This has thus made the registration difficult for a significant number of people in the Bangsamoro Region, as testing centers are already limited as they are, and have become more limited by the pandemic;

**WHEREAS,** one possible mechanism that can be done is to designate more testing centers to accommodate more people despite the pandemic;

**WHEREAS,** the CSC should devise a mechanism that will prioritize the applicants who reside in the province or city being catered by the CSC Field Offices;

**WHEREAS,** another possible mechanism could be for the slots allotted to each field office to be allocated to the applicants who are residents of the province or city where the field office is located, and they must be prioritized among all the other applicants. Thus, the filing of the application to take the exam should and must be done within the province or city where the examinee permanently resides;

**WHEREAS,** there is a need for the CSC to come up with a structure in processing the applications for the CSE that will prioritize the applicants who resides in the province or city where the field office is located which may include, among others, requiring an identification card that reflects where the examinee resides;

**WHEREAS,** this is to avoid, if possible, the applicant from registering and taking the exam in a place other than where he or she resides, since registering and taking it elsewhere can cause additional burdens to the examinee;

**WHEREAS,** there is a significant number of people who are either working in the BARMM government, wishing to become permanent employees, or those who yearn to work in the government, who are not able to do so, because of their lack of eligibility. Thus, there is a need for the CSC to devise a mechanism to accommodate more examinees, so that more people may be able to get the chance to obtain career or government-service eligibility;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED,** by the BTA Parliament, to pass and approve this resolution requesting the CSC to devise a mechanism that will provide an opportunity for everyone to take the CSE.

**RESOLVED FURTHER,** that a copy of this resolution be furnished to the CSC-BARMM.

Adopted,
