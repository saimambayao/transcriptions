**RESOLUTION ENDORSING AL-AMANAH ISLAMIC BANK AS PARTNER LENDING CONDUIT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE-AGRICULTURAL CREDIT POLICY COUNCIL (DA-ACPC) FOR THE COOPERATIVES AND SOCIAL ENTERPRISES IN THE BARMM TO ACCESS INTEREST-FREE LOANS**

**WHEREAS**, the Agricultural Credit Policy Council (ACPC) was created in 1986 by virtue of Executive Order 113 to assist the Department of Agriculture (DA) in synchronizing its credit policies and programs;

**WHEREAS**, in 1992, the role of ACPC was expanded by RA 7607, An Act Providing a Magna Carta of Small Farmers, assigning the following functions to ACPC: to conduct institutional capacity building programs and to develop special projects to promote innovative financing schemes for small farmers;

**WHEREAS**, by virtue of Republic Act No. 8435, the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act (AFMA), the ACPC was tasked to develop the design of the credit scheme called Agro-Industry Modernization Credit and Financing Program (AMCFP), and act as its administrator. The ACPC oversees the administration of the AMCFP Fund to ensure and sustain the adequate flow of credit to agriculture and fisheries, improve the viability of farmers and fisherfolk, and support agriculture modernization, food security and poverty alleviation;

**WHEREAS**, the cooperatives and social enterprises in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) have not been able to access loans from DA-ACPC due to the absence of a conduit bank in the BARMM.

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED** by the Bangsamoro Parliament to endorse Al-Amanah Islamic Bank as partner lending conduit of the Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Credit Policy Council (DA-ACPC) for the Cooperatives and social enterprises in the BARMM to access interest-free loans.
