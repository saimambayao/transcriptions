**RESOLUTION**

**URGING THE MINISTY OF HEALTH TO STRENGTHEN THE VOLUNTARY BLOOD DONATION PROGRAM AND BLOOD TRANSFUSION SERVICES IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO**

**WHEREAS,** Republic Act No. 7719 otherwise known as the “National Blood Services Act of 1994” was passed to establish a national blood services program to ensure adequate, safe, affordable and equitable distribution of supply of blood and blood products;

**WHEREAS,** consistent with the National Blood Services Act of 1994 and the policy of the Bangsamoro Government to promote and uphold the individual basic right to life of its citizens through prompt intervention of excellent medical services, the provision of adequate, quality and safe blood constitutes as an integral part of the region’s health care policy and infrastructure;

**WHEREAS,** due to policy implementation gaps, not only does blood supply fall short of need in many parts of the region particularly in rural areas, it also leads to inequitable distribution of blood supply as it creates a mismatch between where bloods collected from donors are stored and where they are needed;

**WHEREAS,** the 1st to 3rd quarters comparative data Collection vis-à-vis Demand from the Cotabato Regional and Medical Center (CRMC) Blook Bank is a vital reference, to wit:

| | BARMM | | REGION XII | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Year | Collection | Demand | Collection | Demand |
| 2021 | 6,505 | 27,089 | 12,849 | 5,239 |
| 2022 | 7,448 | 27,429 | 13,183 | 8,141 |

**WHEREAS,** to ensure that patients requiring blood transfusion will have timely and equitable access to safe and quality blood, there is a need to step up efforts to promote voluntary blood donation and strengthen the blood transfusion services in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED** by the BTA Parliament, as it hereby resolves, to urge the Ministry of Health to strengthen the voluntary blood donation program and blood transfusion services in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER,** to send a copy of this Resolution to the Ministry of Health for their immediate action.
