**RESOLUTION**

**CALLING ON THE BANGSAMORO COMMISSION FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE CULTURAL HERITAGE (BCPCH) TO CODIFY THE BANGSAMORO CUSTOMARY AND TRADITIONAL LAWS**

WHEREAS, Section 15, Art. X of the constitution mandates the creation of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao that shares “common and distinctive historical and cultural heritage, economic and social structures, and other relevant characteristics within the framework of this Constitution and the national sovereignty as well as territorial integrity of the Republic of the Philippines”;

WHEREAS, Section 4, Art. IX of the Republic Act 11054 otherwise known as the “Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao” provides that “the customs, beliefs, and traditions of the Bangsamoro People are recognized respected and guaranteed. The Parliament shall adopt measures to ensure mutual respect and protection of the distinct beliefs, customs, and traditions of the Bangsamoro people and the other inhabitants in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. No person in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region shall be subjected to any form of discrimination on account of creed religion, ethnic origin, parentage, or gender”;

WHEREAS, under the immediately preceding provision of law, the Bangsamoro Commission for the Preservation of the Cultural Heritage is created which is mandated to “preserve the history, culture, arts, traditions and the rich cultural heritage of the Bangsamoro people and their sultanates such as those of Sulu, Maguindanao, Kabuntalan, Buayan, and the Royal House of Ranao and of the Iranun, and the non-moro indigenous peoples of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region”;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Government declared as a policy the recognition and protection of the customs and traditions, beliefs, and cultures of its indigenous inhabitants. The right of indigenous peoples to a just and equal treatment shall be protected. They shall be free from all forms of discrimination, oppression and exploitation;

WHEREAS, for the most part of the Philippine History, the Bangsamoro Region and most of Mindanao have been a separate territory, which enabled it to develop its own culture and identity;

WHEREAS, the Westernmost and the West-central area have been the traditional homeland of Muslim Filipinos since the 15th century following the arrival of Sheik Karimul Makhdum in the Island province of Tawi-Tawi even before the arrival of the Spanish;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Region is composed of various ethnic groups, each having their own unique system of laws, cultures and traditions governing their daily way of life. Some of the major ethnic tribes are The Badjao, Sama, Tausog, Yakan, Maguindanao, Maranao, Iranun, Bisaya, Teduray;

WHEREAS, The Bangsamoro Region has been implementing the laws of the Shariah as far as practicable and within the bounds of the existing Philippine laws to govern the affairs and conduct of their peoples, and to some extent, the written and unwritten customary and traditional laws have likewise been practiced in their respective area of jurisdiction;

WHEREAS, different ethnic groups practice separate and distinct traditional and customary laws which may vary from one society to another, or from one sultanate to another;

WHEREAS, in matters governing dispute resolutions, which may include marriage or family relations, land disputes, Rido or clan feuds, and other local conflicts, each ethnic group applies their respective traditional and customary law suppletory to the shariah and national law;

WHEREAS, implementors of justice at the community level make reference to the customary and traditional laws of their respective group to aid them in arriving at a just and equitable resolution for the disputing parties;

WHEREAS, in most cases, the application of the Traditional and customary laws find success to help resolve local conflicts between members of the same tribe or of members of different tribes who voluntarily submitted to be governed by the forum of customary and traditional law;

WHEREAS, as an unwritten law of practice, over a stretched period of time, the customary and traditional laws may be subjected to depend on the lingering memories of a particular tribe, thereby risking the possibility of getting abandoned or forgotten;

WHEREAS, the eventual loss of the customary and traditional laws of a particular group of the region effectively obliterates a significant piece of cultural identity, pride, and history of the same;

WHEREAS, failure to enact measures to preserve, maintain and promote the customary and traditional laws of different ethnic groups in the Bangsamoro region is tantamount to neglecting the existence of the cultural identity, pride, and history as well as their guaranteed welfare and protection under existing laws;

WHEREAS, to preserve, maintain and promote the cultural diversity of the Bangsamoro peoples, there is hereby a need to recognize the preservation and protection of the Customary and Traditional Laws of the different groups of the Bangsamoro;

WHEREAS, for purposes of settling local disputes, a codified customary and traditional law will provide the implementers of justice at the community or barangay level a ready and easy access to reference to help the disputants in the resolution of their conflicts;

WHEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED, by the Bangsamoro Parliament to CALL ON THE BANGSAMORO COMMISSION FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE CULTURAL HERITAGE (BCPCH) TO CODIFY THE BANGSAMORO CUSTOMARY AND TRADITIONAL LAWS IN RESOLVING DISPUTES;

RESOLVED, FINALLY, that copies of this resolution be furnished to the BCPCH and other concerned agencies or ministries for information and appropriate consideration.

ADOPTED,
