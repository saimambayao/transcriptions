**RESOLUTION**
**IN AID OF LEGISLATION, INVITING AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COTABATO LIGHT AND POWER COMPANY, TO SHED LIGHT ON THE ISSUES AND CONCERNS OF ITS MEMBER-CONSUMERS**

**WHEREAS**, Section 8, Article IX of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) states that the Bangsamoro Government shall provide, maintain, and ensure the delivery of basic and responsive health programs, quality education, appropriate services, livelihood opportunities, affordable and progressive housing projects, power and electricity, and water supply, among others, to the Bangsamoro people and other inhabitants of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS**, the Cotabato Light and Power Company (Cotabato Light) is an electric utility company located in Cotabato City with a service area covering Cotabato City and parts of the Datu Odin Sinsuat and Sultan Kudarat municipalities¹;

**WHEREAS**, by virtue of R.A. No. 10637, Cotabato Light was granted franchise to construct, install, establish, operate and maintain a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to the end-users in Cotabato City and portions of the municipalities of Datu Odin and Sultan Kudarat;

**WHEREAS**, for the previous month of April, member-consumers of Cotabato Light have expressed their concern and aired out their complaints on social media about the sudden increase in their electric consumption as reflected in their recent electric bills;

**WHEREAS**, Cotabato Light explained in its statement that its customers will see an increase in their recent electricity bills following the effect of higher generation charges brought by drawing more of its power supply requirement in the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM)²;

**WHEREAS**, Cotabato Light also attributes higher electricity bills to the effect of higher generation charges³ in their official page in Facebook;

**WHEREAS**, these high generation charges resulted in an increase of electricity rates in April by PHP 0.6406 per kilowatt-hour versus March (or from PHP 9.9905 per kilowatt-hour to PHP 10.6311 per kilowatt-hour) because of limited allocation from its biggest supplier, the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management (PSALM) Corporation. The PSALM Corporation has asserted that this is due to the effect of the summer months, as it relies mostly on its Hydroelectric Power Plants⁴;

**WHEREAS**, the Generation Charge in the customer’s bill is just a pass-through charge, where Cotabato Light merely acts as a collecting agent for this charge⁵;

**WHEREAS**, Generation Charge is defined as the cost of power generated and sold to the distribution utility by the National Power Corporation (NPC), as well as the Independent Power Producers (IPPs)⁶;

**WHEREAS**, despite Cotabato Light’s explanation, increasing numbers of member-consumers continue to vent out their frustrations over the big increase in their electric bills, where some of the members’ electric bills increased up to double compared to their previous months;

**WHEREAS**, given the increasing number of complaints by the member-consumers of Cotabato Light over their electric bills, it is the duty of the Bangsamoro Government to promote and protect the interests of the Bangsamoro people and other inhabitants of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the BTA Parliament to pass and approve this Resolution, in aid of legislation, inviting an authorized representative of Cotabato Light and Power Company (Cotabato Light), to shed light on the issues and concerns of its member-consumers.

**RESOLEVD FURTHER**, that a copy of this Resolution be furnished to the Cotabato Light.

Adopted,
