**WHEREAS,** the same Section of the above-mentioned law states that the Bangsamoro Government shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them.

**WHEREAS,** the World Health Organization defined health as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.

**WHEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BTA PARLIAMENT,** as it is hereby resolved, to require the Ministry of Health (MOH) to present to the BTA Parliament an overall plan on the establishment and upgrading of hospitals providing its indicative budget requirements, in order to aid legislation.
