**WHEREAS**, **Section 14**, Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall respect, protect, and promote the rights of children, especially orphans of tender age. Their education and development, both physical and mental, shall be protected from exploitation, abuse, or discrimination;

**WHEREAS**, the same provision categorically states that the Bangsamoro policies and programs shall take into utmost consideration the best interest of children, and promote and protect the rights of children, youth, and adolescents, including their survival and development;

**WHEREAS**, **Section 3**, Article V of the BOL provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare;

**WHEREAS**, Republic Act No. 10627 or the *Anti-Bullying Act of 2013* was signed into law by then President Benigno S. Aquino III on September 12, 2013 to protect students from bullying and other forms of violence that may be inflicted upon them;

**WHEREAS**, **Section 2** of the said law defines bullying in the following manner:

**Section 2. Acts of Bullying.** - For purposes of this Act, “bullying” shall refer to any severe or repeated use by one or more students of a written, verbal or electronic expression, or a physical act or gesture, or any combination thereof, directed at another student that has the effect of actually causing or placing the latter in reasonable fear of physical or emotional harm or damage to his property; creating a hostile environment at school for the other student; infringing on the rights of the other student at school; or materially and substantially disrupting the education process or the orderly operation of a school; such as but not limited to, the following:

a. Any unwanted physical contact between the bully and the victim like punching, pushing, shoving, kicking, slapping, tickling, headlocks, inflicting school pranks, teasing, fighting and the use of available objects as weapons;

b. Any act that causes damage to a victim’s psyche and/or emotional well-being;

d. Cyber-bullying or any bullying done through the use of technology or any electronic means.

**WHEREAS**, **Section 3** of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of R.A. 10627 provides that the State recognizes education as a critical component of human capital development, socio-economic equality, inclusive growth, sustainable development, and fulfillment of human rights. Towards this end, educational institutions shall foster a love for humanity, respect for human rights, strengthen ethical and spiritual values, develop moral character and personal discipline, and a create safe, inclusive, and supportive educational environment for all children through the development of comprehensive anti-bullying policies;

**WHEREAS**, **Section 17** of the Revised IRR provides for sanctions for non-compliance to R.A. 10627 of both public and private schools, to wit:

**Section 17.1. Public Schools.** School personnel of public elementary or secondary schools who fail to comply with the provisions of the Act or this Revised IRR shall be subject to administrative proceedings in accordance with the Civil Service Rules and other relevant issuances of the Department of Education (DepEd). The school administrator shall be held accountable for the non-compliance of the anti-bullying policy of the school and the zero-reporting of incidents of bullying shall not automatically be construed as a reflection of positive performance of the school.

**Section 17.2. Private Schools.** School personnel of private elementary or secondary schools who fail to comply with the provisions of the Act or this Revised IRR shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary sanctions as may be imposed by the private school. A copy of the decision in such cases shall be submitted to the Department of Education.

Private schools that fail to comply with the requirements of the Act or this Revised IRR shall be subject to appropriate administrative proceedings of the DepEd governing private schools.

**Section 17.3. Secretary of Education.** The Secretary of the DepEd, through the Regional Director, may suspend or revoke, as may be appropriate, the permit or recognition of a private school that fails to comply with the requirements under the Act or this Revised IRR;

**WHEREAS**, according to the findings of the Program from International Student Assessment (PISA) 2019, 65% of Filipino students reported being victims of any type of bullying at least a few times a month, with 40% being bullied frequently (once a week or more)²;

**WHEREAS**, the PISA 2022 reports that one out of three Filipino students are being bullied in schools. Approximately 43% of girls and 53% of boys in the Philippines encounter bullying incidents multiple times a month. This is much higher than the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average of 20% of girls, and 21% of boys³;

**WHEREAS**, during the Senate Hearing of Committee on Basic Education of the Senate which discussed the recent incidents of bullying and violence in schools, and the policies and preventive measures of the Department of Education, Atty. Mojahid Salic Guro, the Chief Legal Officer of the Legal and Legislative Liaison Division of the Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education (MBHTE), stated that while laws protecting children such as the *Anti-Bullying Act of 2013* and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) provide clear legal mandate for schools to act against bullying and other forms of violence, their implementation in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) faces distinct and complex challenges⁴;

**WHEREAS**, during the said Senate Hearing, Atty. Guro enumerated the challenges facing the implementation of Anti-Bullying Act of 2013 and its IRR, to wit:

a. There remains a limited awareness among students, parents and even some school personnel about what constitutes bullying particularly where traditional practices may normalize forms of peer aggression;

b. Cultural and religious sensitivity require that the interventions be carefully tailored to ensure that they are both legally compliant and respectful of Islamic values and indigenous traditions;

c. Lack of trained guidance counselors or guidance associates and psychosocial professionals in many of the schools in BARMM hinders the Bangsamoro Government’s ability to provide appropriate interventions to both victims and perpetrators;

d. Resource constraints, particularly in geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas continue to hamper the implementation of proactive anti-bullying programs; and

e. The persistent effects of armed conflict and displacement have compounded the vulnerabilities of many Bangsamoro learners making bullying and violence prevention part of the broader agenda of peacebuilding, healing, and resilience in the Bangsamoro communities⁵;

**WHEREAS**, according to Atty. Guro, the MBHTE has adopted in 2022 the comprehensive Child Protection Policy (CPP) which is tailored to the unique realities of the BARMM and anchored primarily on moral governance⁶;

**WHEREAS**, **Section 2** of the CPP provides that the BOL mandates that the Bangsamoro Government shall respect, protect, and promote the rights of children, especially orphans of tender age. They shall be protected from exploitation, abuse, or discrimination. Their education, growth, and physical, psychological, and spiritual development shall be fully protected;

**WHEREAS**, the same provision states that Bangsamoro policies and programs shall take into utmost consideration the best interest of children, youth, and adolescents, and to promote and protect their rights such as, but not limited to, their right to survival, development, protection, and participation;

**WHEREAS**, for School Year 2023-2024, a total of 356 cases of bullying incidents have been formally reported across BARMM and at least 225 cases of bullying incidents and 2 cases of other form of violence have been reported in SY 2024-2025⁷;

**WHEREAS**, children spent most of their time in school, where they require extra care and protection. These formative years are crucial, as their school experiences can significantly influence their personality and affect their mental, emotional, and social development⁸;

**WHEREAS**, bullying among basic education learners is a pressing issue that we cannot afford to neglect. The future of our nation lies in the hands of our youth, and it is our responsibility to protect and nurture them⁹;

**WHEREAS**, in the BARMM, the ministry mandated to perform the mandates, tasks and responsibilities of the Department of Education (DepEd) in the region is the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education (MBHTE);

**WHEREAS**, **Section 6**, Chapter 1 of Bangsamoro Autonomy Act (BAA) No. 18 or the *Bangsamoro Education Code of 2021* provides that the administration of the Bangsamoro Educational System, as well as its supervision and regulation, is hereby vested to the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education without prejudice to state-colleges and universities which shall be governed by their respective charter;

**WHEREAS**, the MBHTE is mandated to be primarily responsible for the formulation, planning, implementation, and coordination of the policies, plans, programs, and projects in the areas of formal and non-formal education at all levels, supervise all educational institutions, both public and private, and provide for the establishment, maintenance, and support of a complete, adequate, and integrated system of education relevant and responsive to the needs, ideals, and aspirations of the Bangsamoro People;

**WHEREAS**, in light of the widespread and recurrent instances of violence, intimidation, and harassment in schools that obstruct the Bangsamoro students’ capacity to fulfill their potential and growth as individuals, it is critical to identify and recognize the problems and challenges associated with pursuing the strict enforcement of the law that can address and reduce the worryingly high prevalence of bullying in the country, particularly in the Bangsamoro region;

**WHEREAS**, in order to improve the lives of Bangsamoro youth, the Bangsamoro Government must make a constant effort to nurture kids by offering high-quality education and additional security at the same time by strengthening the efficient execution of the current national and regional policies and programs;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) Parliament to pass and approve this Resolution urging the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education (MBHTE) to promote and monitor the implementation of Republic Act no. 10627 or the *Anti-Bullying Act of 2013* and to ensure compliance thereto of all public and private schools within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM);

**BE IT RESOLVED FURTHER**, that a copy of this Resolution be furnished to the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education (MBHTE) for its information and appropriate action.

Adopted,
