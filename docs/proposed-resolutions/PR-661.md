**A RESOLUTION CALLING ON THE PHILIPPINE NATIONAL POLICE AND OTHER RELEVANT LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES TO IMMEDIATELY INVESTIGATE THE SHOOTING OF TWO YOUNG ADULTS, BOTH HAFIDH, IN SHARIFF AGUAK, MAGUINDANAO DEL SUR, AND TO TAKE DECISIVE ACTION TO ENSURE JUSTICE, COMMUNITY SAFETY, AND PREVENTION OF SIMILAR INCIDENTS**

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Parliament, as the legislative body of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), upholds the principles of justice, security, and peace as enshrined in the Bangsamoro Organic Law and the Constitution of the Philippines;

**WHEREAS**, it has come to the attention of this Parliament that two young adults, both hafidh (memorizers of the Holy Qur'an), were tragically and senselessly shot in Shariff Aguak, Maguindanao del Sur on November 14, 2024 demand immediate investigation and action;

**WHEREAS**, the killing of individuals who have devoted their lives to memorizing the Holy Qur'an is a reprehensible act that deeply wounds the moral and spiritual fabric of the Bangsamoro community, and such incidents threaten public safety, peace, and social harmony in the region;

**WHEREAS**, the Police Regional Office-Bangsamoro Autonomous Region (PRO-BAR) and other relevant law enforcement agencies are mandated to uphold public safety, investigate crimes with transparency and efficiency, and bring perpetrators to justice to protect the Bangsamoro people;

**WHEREAS**, it is imperative to take immediate action not only to resolve this case but also to prevent similar violent incidents, which undermine public trust in law enforcement and disrupt the region's path toward peace and development;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved, that the Bangsamoro Parliament strongly urges the Police Regional Office-Bangsamoro Autonomous Region and other pertinent law enforcement authorities to:

1. Launch an urgent, thorough, and impartial investigation into the shooting of the two young adults in Shariff Aguak, Maguindanao del Sur, to determine the facts surrounding the incident, identify the perpetrators, and hold them accountable under the full force of the law;

2. Ensure the swift apprehension and prosecution of the suspects responsible for this heinous crime, to serve as a deterrent to future acts of violence and reaffirm the region's commitment to justice and the rule of law;

3. Deploy heightened security measures in Shariff Aguak and nearby areas, including increased police visibility, enhanced patrols, and community-based crime prevention programs to restore peace and order;

4. Establish active coordination with local government units (LGUs), community elders, religious leaders, and other stakeholders to address the root causes of violence and strengthen peacebuilding initiatives in the affected area;

5. Provide necessary assistance and protection to the families of the victims, including psychological and social support, to help them cope with the aftermath of this tragedy;

6. Undertake a comprehensive review of the security landscape in Shariff Aguak and other areas within Maguindanao del Sur to identify vulnerabilities, recommend reforms, and implement measures to mitigate the risks of violence; and

7. Regularly update the Bangsamoro Parliament on the progress of the investigation and related law enforcement activities, including any policy recommendations to enhance the safety and security of the Bangsamoro people.

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, that this resolution be communicated to the Police Regional Office-Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, the Ministry of Public Order and Safety, the Bangsamoro Human Rights Commission, the Office of the Chief Minister, and other relevant agencies for their immediate and appropriate action.

**ADOPTED** this _ day of ______, 2024, in the Bangsamoro Parliament.
