**RESOLUTION**
**IN SUPPORT OF THE MOTIONS FILED BY THE BANGSAMORO ATTORNEY GENERAL’S OFFICE (BAGO) AND OTHER INDIVIDUAL MOTIONS BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT REGARDING THE EXCLUSION OF THE PROVINCE OF SULU FROM THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM)**

WHEREAS, Section 25 of the same Article provides that the State shall ensure the autonomy of local governments;

WHEREAS, Section 15, Article X of the Constitution provides that there shall be created autonomous regions in Muslim Mindanao and in the Cordilleras consisting of provinces, cities, municipalities, and geographical areas sharing common and distinctive historical and cultural heritage, economic and social structures, and other relevant characteristics within the framework of this Constitution and the national sovereignty as well as territorial integrity of the Republic of the Philippines;

WHEREAS, Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6734, which became a law on August 1, 1989, governed the creation and operations of the defunct Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) which, in a plebiscite on November 17, 1989, encompassed Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi;

WHEREAS, R.A. 9054 which strengthened, expanded, and amended R.A. No. 6734, was enacted on March 31, 2001 and took effect following its ratification through a plebiscite on August 14, 2001 wherein six (6) municipalities of Lanao del Norte; thirty-nine (39) barangays in the municipalities of Aleosan, Carmen, Kabacan, Midsayap, Pigkawayan, and Pikit in the Province of North Cotabato; Cotabato City; and Isabela City in the Province of Basilan, voted for inclusion in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao;

WHEREAS, the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB) was signed on March 2, 2014 in a ceremony, thus concluding 17 years of negotiations between the Government of the Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF);

WHEREAS, R.A. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) was signed into law on July 27, 2018 by Former President Rodrigo Duterte and repealed R.A. No. 6734 as amended by R.A. No. 9054;

WHEREAS, the BOL was ratified through a plebiscite on January 21, 2019 for the core territories, namely the provinces of Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu, Basilan, and Tawi-Tawi, the component cities of Marawi and Lamitan, as well as the City of Cotabato;¹

WHEREAS, on February 6, 2019, another plebiscite was held in Lanao del Norte, as well as in the municipalities of Aleosan, Carmen, Kabacan, Midsayap, Pikit, and Pigkawayan in North Cotabato, and other areas that sought inclusion in the proposed BARMM, leading to the inclusion of 63 Barangays from North Cotabato;²

WHEREAS, Section 2 (a), Article III of the BOL provides that the territorial jurisdiction of the BARMM, subject to the indispensable plebiscite, shall be composed, *inter alia*, of the present geographical area known as the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao created under R.A. No. 6734, as amended by R.A. No. 9054, which includes the Province of Sulu;³

WHEREAS, Section 2, Article IV of the BOL states that in the exercise of its right to self-governance, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is free to pursue its political, economic, social, and cultural development as provided for in the Organic Law;

WHEREAS, by virtue of the BOL, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region has established offices with the requisite facilities, employed staff, and exercised oversight and control over programs and projects within its jurisdiction, including the Province of Sulu since the effectivity of this law in 2019;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) was created pursuant to Section 2, Article XVI of the BOL which shall be the interim government in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region during the transition period. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) shall lead the BTA, without prejudice to the participation of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) in its membership;

WHEREAS, former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte signed on October 28, 2021 R.A. No. 11593 or the law extending the transition period of Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) from 2022 to 2025, thereby postponing the first regional parliamentary elections in the region;⁴

WHEREAS, Section 2 of the said law provides that during the extension of the transition period, the BTA shall continue as the interim government in the BARMM: provided, however, that the President may appoint the eighty (80) new interim members of the BTA who shall serve up to June 30, 2025 or until their successors shall have been elected and qualified;

WHEREAS, President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, Jr. administered the oath to the eighty (80) newly and re-appointed members of the BTA in a ceremony at Malacañang Palace on August 12, 2022;⁵

WHEREAS, the BTA, being the interim government of BARMM, plays a crucial role and has been an instrument for an inclusive, beneficial, transparent, and effective transition and for the smooth implementation of the provisions of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) and the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB) before the end of the transition period;

WHEREAS, on September 9, 2024, the Supreme Court promulgated its *En Banc* decision on the case of *Province of Sulu, et al. v. Medialdea, et al.*, G.R. Nos. 242255, 243246, and 243693. The Court ruled that the BOL is constitutional but excluded the Province of Sulu from the jurisdiction of the BARMM after the province rejected the law’s ratification in the plebiscite;

WHEREAS, the Supreme Court’s decision to exclude the province of Sulu from BARMM has caused and created ambiguities in the provisions of the BTA’s already enacted Bangsamoro Autonomy Acts, which can tremendously affect crucial aspects of the upcoming BARMM parliamentary elections, including the composition of the Bangsamoro Parliament, the distribution of seats in parliamentary districts, and the rights to vote and to be elected, including representation, among other things;

WHEREAS, the BARMM’s official receipt of the Supreme Court decision was on September 16, 2024;⁶

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Attorney-General’s Office (BAGO) was created by virtue of Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 5 or otherwise known as, “An Act Creating the Bangsamoro Attorney-General’s Office, Defining Its Functions and Powers, Appropriating Funds Therefor, and for Other Related Purposes”;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Attorney-General is mandated to be the chief legal counsel of the Bangsamoro Government;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Government, through the BAGO, filed on October 1, 2024, a **motion for leave to intervene** and to admit the attached **motion for partial reconsideration** before the Supreme Court on its decision excluding the Province of Sulu from the BARMM;⁷

WHEREAS, under the Rules of Court, particularly Section 1, Rule 19, it is provided that any person who has a legal interest in the matter in litigation, or in the success of either of the parties, or an interest against both, or is so situated as to be adversely affected by a distribution or other disposition of property in the custody of the court or an officer thereof may, with leave of court, be allowed to intervene in the action;

WHEREAS, furthermore, the said section also provides that the Court shall consider whether or not intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of rights of the original parties, and whether or not the intervenor’s rights may be fully protected in a separate proceeding;

WHEREAS, the motion for leave to intervene filed by BAGO is its way to request the Supreme Court’s permission to allow the Bangsamoro Government to be part of the case, despite it not originally being involved in the proceeding;

WHEREAS, under the same rules, particularly Section 1, Rule 52, it states that a party may file a motion for reconsideration of a judgment of final resolution within 15 days from notice thereof, with proof of service on the adverse party;

WHEREAS, BAGO Officer-in-Charge Atty. Mohammad Al-Amin Julkipli said in an interview, that “[f]or us in the BARMM, there is a special circumstance because when this case was filed in 2018, the BARMM was not yet constituted. When it was already pending in the [Supreme] Court, the BARMM, even though it has already been constituted, was not formally impleaded; meaning, throughout the light life of the case, the autonomous region itself was never a party”;⁸

WHEREAS, he also clarified that as written in the judgment, the Supreme Court decision is “immediately executory” and not “final and executory,” which means that there is still room to resort to legal remedies, such as a motion for partial reconsideration;⁹

WHEREAS, he further said, “[m]ore importantly, as the Chief Minister emphasized, it is because the province of Sulu is very fundamental to the cause of the Bangsamoro... and that it is part and parcel of the Bangsamoro identity with a very important role to play in our continuous struggle for our autonomy and development as one people”;¹⁰

WHEREAS, several members of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) Parliament have also filed similar motions before the Supreme Court;

WHEREAS, on October 17, 2024, BTA Parliament Deputy Speaker, Atty. Laisa Masuhud Alamia, filed a motion for leave to intervene, with an attached motion for partial reconsideration, before the Supreme Court;¹¹

WHEREAS, she argued that excluding the Province of Sulu from the Muslim autonomous region would disrupt the ongoing peace and development efforts in the region, as it contradicts the longstanding sociocultural cohesion of the Bangsamoro people;¹²

WHEREAS, moreover, she stated, “it is our hope that we can continue to work on building a just and lasting peace for our people, including our constituents in Sulu. Otherwise, we might end up being forced apart despite our desire to uplift every Bangsamoro as our people intended when we struggled together for our right to self-determination”;¹³

WHEREAS, on October 18, 2024, BTA member Engr. Don Arbison Loong, together with MP Adzfar Usman, Atty. Nazir Ynawat, Atty. Jamal Kulayan, Nasser Arbison Loong, Mhavejekamar L. Marrack of Tulong Lupah Sug, and Atty. Moh Raf Tungupon Baird, also formally submitted a Motion to Intervene and a Verified Motion for Partial Reconsideration before the Supreme Court;¹⁴

WHEREAS, they argued that the exclusion of Sulu directly contradicts the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), which was designed to unify the historically and culturally connected areas of Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago into one cohesive Bangsamoro region;¹⁵

WHEREAS, they outlined in their petition how the Province of Sulu would be deprived of essential funding and development programs critical to its future, further stating that in 2024, the Ministry of Finance, Budget, and Management (MFBM) allocated over ₱4.5 billion to support 7,872 positions in Sulu’s ministries and offices;¹⁶

WHEREAS, moreover, these jobs represent more than just numbers—they are lifelines for thousands of families, fueling hope and stability in the region;¹⁷

WHEREAS, the Supreme Court decision, as soon as it becomes final and executory, will completely remove the Province of Sulu from the Bangsamoro Region’s jurisdiction, which will have a significant impact on the offices established, the associated infrastructures, and the personnel employed therein;

WHEREAS, the Province of Sulu’s exclusion will entail legal, financial, administrative, and social changes that will have far-reaching implications to the entire autonomous region;

WHEREAS, absent its absolute finality, the decision’s immediate implementation could cause instability and confusion in the region, which could have serious effects for the Province of Sulu and its residents, as well as for the region’s larger governance and peace-building initiatives;

WHEREAS, in addition to its legal significance, the Province of Sulu’s strong and deep historical and cultural ties to the Bangsamoro identity and struggle makes it an integral part of the Bangsamoro;

WHEREAS, without the Province of Sulu and its people, the Bangsamoro would never be the same;

WHEREAS, the transition period plays a crucial role in ensuring the smooth establishment of BARMM as an autonomous political entity, with enhanced self-governance and jurisdiction over the Bangsamoro region, free from legal impediments;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, as the interim government of the BARMM, must uphold to the goal of a united Bangsamoro, and guarantee the fulfillment of the obligations enshrined in the CAB;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED,** by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) Parliament, to pass and approve this Resolution in Support of the Motions Filed by the Bangsamoro Attorney General’s Office (BAGO) and Other Individual Motions Before the Supreme Court Regarding the Exclusion of the Province of Sulu from the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.

Adopted,
