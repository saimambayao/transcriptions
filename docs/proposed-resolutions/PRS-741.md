**RESOLUTION REQUESTING THE HONORABLE CHIEF MINISTER ABDULRAOF A. MACACUA TO ENCOURAGE ALL MINISTRIES, OFFICES AND OTHER GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING THE PARLIAMENT IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION, TO PATRONIZE LOCAL MALLS, HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS THAT OFFER HOSPITALITY SERVICES APPROPRIATE FOR OFFICIAL GATHERINGS THAT INCLUDE MEETINGS, SEMINARS, CONFERENCES, EVENT PLANNING, AND OTHER SOCIAL ACTIVITIES FOR AUSTERITY AND SHARED ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, UNLESS FOR REASONABLE PURPOSE THAT A PARTICULAR ACTIVITY NEEDS TO BE HELD OUTSIDE BARMM**

**WHEREAS**, hospitality service is a field of the service industry that includes but is not limited to accommodation, food and beverage services, event planning, and entertainment;

**WHEREAS**, malls, hotels and restaurants with multi-purpose structures are the most common social hubs that offer accommodation, food and beverage services for indoor social programs and activities that include seminars, conferences, trainings, office planning and other social activities;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region has enough number of malls, hotels and restaurants that can provide quality hospitality services to the clients or consumers;

**WHEREAS**, patronizing the services of the local malls, hotels and restaurants by the executive and legislative bodies of the Bangsamoro government in their respective official gatherings is essential in alleviating the income of these hospitality hubs, and in contributing higher share to the income of the region through their respective income tax returns;

**WHEREAS**, holding official gatherings in the region would reduce the inconveniences and expenditures of the Bangsamoro government without sacrificing the expected outputs and outcomes of these activities.

**NOW THEREFORE**, for and in consideration of the foregoing premises, we resolve as we hereby resolved to request the honorable Chief Minister Abdulraof A. Macacua to encourage all ministries, offices and other government, including the parliament in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, to patronize local malls, hotels and restaurants that offer hospitality services appropriate for official gatherings that include meetings, seminars, conferences, event planning, and other social activities for austerity and shared economic development, unless for reasonable purpose that a particular activity needs to be held outside BARMM.
