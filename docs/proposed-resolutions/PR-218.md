**WHEREAS**, Section 5, Article II of the 1987 Constitution states that the maintenance of peace and order, the protection of life, liberty, and property, and the promotion of the general welfare are essential for the enjoyment by all the people of the blessings of democracy;

**WHEREAS**, Section 11 of the same article states that the State values the dignity of every human person and guarantees full respect for human rights;

**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Article IV of R.A. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) provides that in the exercise of its right to self-governance, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is free to pursue its political, economic, social and cultural development as provided for in the Organic Law;

**WHEREAS**, Section 3, Article V of the BOL provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants;

**WHEREAS**, the Anti-Hazing Act of 2018 defines “hazing” as any act that results in physical or psychological suffering, harm, or injury inflicted on a recruit, neophyte, applicant, or member as part of an initiation rite or practice made as a prerequisite for admission or a requirement for continuing membership in a fraternity, sorority, or organization including, but not limited to paddling, whipping, beating, branding, forced calisthenics, exposure to the weather, forced consumption of any food, liquor, beverage, drug or other substance, or any other brutal treatment or forced physical activity which is likely to adversely affect the physical and psychological health of such recruit, neophyte, applicant, or member. This shall also include any activity, intentionally made or otherwise, by one person alone or acting with others, that tends to humiliate or embarrass, degrade, abuse, or endanger, by requiring a recruit, neophyte, applicant, or member to do menial, silly, or foolish tasks;

**WHEREAS**, Republic Act No. 11053 or the Anti-Hazing Act of 2018 was enacted as a result of the death of Horacio “Atio” Castillo III, a University of Santo Tomas law student, in 2017 due to hazing¹;

**WHEREAS**, hazing is conducted during initiation rites, which is defined as “ceremonies, practices, rituals, or other acts, whether formal or informal, that a person must perform or take part in order to be accepted into fraternity, sorority, organization as a full-fledged member”;

**WHEREAS**, the said law outrightly prohibits and considered hazing a criminal act while providing substantial penalties for those who will be found guilty of violating the provisions of the law;

**WHEREAS**, despite the passage of the law intended to prohibit and prevent fatal hazing incidents, hazing still persisted, and many lives continue to be lost due to the brutal practice of admission into an organization;

**WHEREAS**, on February 28, 2023, an Adamson University Chemical Engineering student John Matthew Salilig’s body was found in a shallow grave in Imus, Cavite²;

**WHEREAS**, according to the autopsy conducted by the Cavite Provincial Crime Laboratory, John Matthew died from severe blunt force trauma to his lower extremities;

**WHEREAS**, the Laguna Provincial Police Office investigators discovered that John Matthew was a victim of hazing conducted by the members of the Tau Gamma Phi Fraternity Adamson Chapter;

**WHEREAS**, several individuals still practice hazing due to the lack of information of the general public regarding the prohibitions set forth in the Anti-Hazing Act of 2018, alongside its difficulty in enforcing, and the gravity of punishments imposed therein;

**WHEREAS**, there is a need to further educate and remind the people, especially college and post-graduate students, on the realities of hazing and the provisions of the Anti-Hazing Act of 2018;

**WHEREAS**, one way of disseminating information and instilling knowledge to general public is through information, education and communication campaign on the provisions of Anti-Hazing Act of 2018, through the provision of informational materials, seminars, orientations to the public, and strengthening the education campaign in attempt to remind Higher Education Institutions and its constituents in the Bangsamoro of the consequences of violating such; and

**WHEREAS**, conducting seminars and orientations for the public, especially in the communities regarding the ban on hazing as a means of admission and continuing membership to any organization, association, society, fraternity, and sorority can help educate and dissuade the Bangsamoro people from engaging in any form of hazing as a condition to entering any organization, association society, fraternity, or sorority.

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the BTA Parliament, to pass and approve this Resolution urging the Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education to include in its programs, an awareness raising on the pertinent provisions of the Anti-Hazing Act of 2018 for the Higher Education Institutions in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.

**RESOLVED FINALLY**, that copy of this Resolution be furnished to the Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education, for information and appropriate action.

Adopted,
