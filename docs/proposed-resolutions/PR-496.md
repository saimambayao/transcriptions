**WHEREAS,** Section 16, Article II of the 1987 Philippine Constitution states that the State shall protect and advance the right of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology in accord with the rhythm and harmony of nature;

**WHEREAS,** Section 3, Article III of the Republic Act No. 11054, also known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), states that all inland waters such as lakes, rivers, river systems, and streams within its territorial jurisdiction shall form part of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region inland waters. The preservation and management of the inland waters shall be under the Bangsamoro Government as provided for in Section 22, Article XIII of the Organic Law;

**WHEREAS,** Section 2, Article IV of the BOL states that in the exercise of its right to self-governance, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is free to pursue its political, economic, social, and cultural development as provided for in the Organic Law;

**WHEREAS,** Section 3, Article V of the aforementioned law states that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are **essential to the promotion of general welfare.** Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the **preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology,** encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, **enhance economic prosperity** and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and **preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants;**

**WHEREAS,** Lake Lanao is located in the province of Lanao del Sur of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). It is a proclaimed watershed reserve by virtue of Proclamation No. 871, issued on February 26, 1992, and is included in the initial components of the National Protected Areas System (NIPAS) governed under NIPAS Act of 1992 (Republic Act No. 7586)²;

**WHEREAS,** Lake Lanao is the largest lake in Mindanao, the second largest in the Philippines, and is considered as one of the 15 ancient lakes in the world. Furthermore, the lake has five watersheds with rivers, alongside major tributaries totaling over 431 km³;

**WHEREAS,** the waters from these rivers and tributaries drain into the lake and goes out through only one outlet, the Agus River in Lanao del Norte, which flows southwest into Iligan Bay via two channels; Maria Cristina Falls, the largest waterfall in the country and the Linamon Falls⁴;

**WHEREAS,** the total area of its inland water is 336 hectares (ha), where Lake Lanao has a surface area of about 36,300 ha⁵;

**WHEREAS,** there are major problems within the Lake Lanao, including illegal logging, small-scale mining and quarrying activities, soil erosion leading to siltation plus the increased turbidity of the waterways, and domestic pollution⁶;

**WHEREAS,** organic pollution occurs when large quantities of organic compounds are released into aquatic ecosystems. Sources of pollution usually come from wastes generated by agricultural, residential, and industrial activities⁷;

**WHEREAS,** high levels also of inorganic nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in water can cause an overgrowth of plants and algae. As plants and algae die, they become organic materials in the water. The decomposition of these organic materials uses high amounts of oxygen, thus depriving the fish population of needed oxygen in the lake⁸;

**WHEREAS,** although according to a study conducted posted by the Department of Science and Technology-National Research Council of the Philippines (DOST-NRCP) that was posted on their website, Lake Lanao remains pristine and clean⁹ overall;

**WHEREAS,** in the same study, it is also emphasized that the lake continues to face the threat of rapid deterioration due to increased human population and activities around the lake, as prompted by the resettlement of the people near the lake after the Marawi siege¹⁰;

**WHEREAS,** the study also calls on the local government to strengthen their policies to maintain the healthy condition of the lake¹¹, where the Bangsamoro Government must act to conserve and protect the lake from degradation;

**WHEREAS,** it is imperative for the Bangsamoro Government to address the developing issues surrounding the preservation and advancement of the ecological system and the environmental conditions of the Lake;

**WHEREAS,** this can be best achieved through a development of an ecotourism plan that aims to preserve the ecological features, address domestic pollution and develop Lake Lanao as sustainable and environmentally-friendly tourism destination;

**WHEREAS,** moreover, the development of Lake Lanao as an official tourist destination can catalyze the increase of potential investments in the area;

**WHEREAS,** the Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority (BPDA) serves as the planning, coordinating, and monitoring agency for all development plans, policies, programs and projects of the Bangsamoro Government¹²;

**WHEREAS,** the Ministry of Trade, Investment and Tourism (MTIT) is mandated to implement laws, programs and projects on trade, investments, and tourism¹³;

**WHEREAS,** the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources, and Energy (MENRE) is the primary agency responsible for the exploration, utilization, management, conservation, protection and sustainable development of the region’s environment, natural resources and potential energy sources¹⁴. Also, it includes the adoption of programs and projects, to ensure that the maintenance of ecological balance and biodiversity and shall be given priority¹⁵;

**WHEREAS,** the MENRE as one of the primary agencies responsible for the preservation of the Lake Lanao, shall be entrusted with the responsibility of creating an ecotourism plan;

**WHEREAS,** Lake Lanao defines the culture and identity of the Maranaos, and is considered as the heart of the Maranao people’s spiritual, cultural, social, political and economic life¹⁶. The lake must be protected at all costs through its preservation and rehabilitation to avoid further deterioration; and

**WHEREAS,** the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, as the interim government of the Bangsamoro region, must create development initiatives, programs and practicable measures which shall conserve, protect, maintain, sustain and develop the Lake Lanao.

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED,** by the BTA Parliament, to pass and approve this Resolution Urging the Ministry of Trade, Investment and Tourism (MTIT), The Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources and Energy (MENRE), and the Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority (BPDA) to Develop an Ecotourism Destination Plan for Lake Lanao to Promote and Preserve its Ecological Features and Increase Economic Activities in the Area.
