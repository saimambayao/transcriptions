**A RESOLUTION**

**REQUESTING THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT, THROUGH THE HONORABLE AHOD “Al-Hadj Murad” B. EBRAHIM, INTERIM CHIEF MINISTER, BANGSAMORO TRANSITION GOVERNMENT, TO CONSIDER THE PROPOSED “BARANIBOD RESETTLEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT AREA (BRAD) PROGRAM” A PRIORITY FOR FAMILIES OF LANDLESS BANGSAMORO MUJAHIDEEN, AND THE MECHANISM TO BUILD A MODEL BANGSAMORO COMMUNITY OUTSIDE THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION; AND TO PROVIDE ADMINISTRATIVE, TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THEREFOR, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OR BOTH**

**WHEREAS**, Baranibod is a Sitio of Barangay Dado, Alamada, Cotabato. Around 8,400 hectares of the area have not been settled eversince. This 8,400-hectare area was awarded by the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) to seven (7) trusted Bangsamoro mujahideen leaders and companions as part of the confidence building program of the Philippine Government in its peace negotiations with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) under the Ramos administration in 2000;

**WHEREAS**, the area is vegetated by forest trees and non-wood plants like grasses and herbs; and a score of wildlife birds freely flying over the area and animal species comfortably roaming around it. Streams and other water sources are also found where a good quality of sand can be a potential source of income of the corporate community and the individual constituents. The area is highly elevated, characterized by rolling, hilly and undulating terrain;

**WHEREAS**, a “3-day Baranibod-focused Rapid Strategic Planning on Building Competitive Bangsamoro Communities” was designed and conducted by the Instructional Communication and System Management Circle (ICSMC) composed of PhD-Rural Development students of Cotabato Foundation College of Science and Technology (CFCST) under Dr. Alimen W. Sencil and League of Bangsamoro Organization, Inc. (LBO), upon request and sponsorship of MP Mohammad Kelie U. Antao who owns the general concept of the program, held at the Ace Royale, Barangay Poblacion 8, Midsayap, Cotabato on June 2-4, 2023;

**WHEREAS**, the aforementioned planning-workshop was participated by competent planning officers of concerned ministries and offices of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, who collectively believe that the Baranibod enclave is highly potential for agro-industrial production and eco-tourism once its rich resources are wisely utilized and properly managed; Thus, they decisively formulated the **Baranibod Resettlement and Area Development (BRAD)** concept, and came up with the program’s 5-Year Strategic Development Plan;

**WHEREAS**, the participants’ support to the idea was inspired by the following facts, thoughts and stipulations which they collectively unveiled during the 3-day planning-workshop, to wit:

1) That, assistance from the Bangsamoro government and Parliament are legally inspired by Section 12 (Assistance to Other Bangsamoro Communities), Article VI (Intergovernmental Relations) of the Bangsamoro Organic Law, which states that

> “The National Government shall ensure the protection of the rights of the Bangsamoro people residing in communities outside the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region and undertake programs for their rehabilitation and development. The Bangsamoro Government, in coordination with the local government units where these communities are located and the appropriate national government agencies, shall provide assistance to enhance their economic, social and cultural development”;

2) That, the resettlement of prioritized landless families of Bangsamoro mujahideen in the area by the Bangsamoro government is an urgent opportunity, as landlessness is now among other serious problems of the Bangsamoro as a result primarily of the Mindanao conflict where they were forced to vacate their area, and consequently resulted into the lost of these areas to land grabbers; and

3) That, the proposed program designed for the landless families of Bangsamoro mujahideen to live, make use of the available resources for their socioeconomic development, sustain a well-established ecosystem, and eventually convert their community into dynamic and progressive Bangsamoro population center in the heart of forest hills of the Sitio would be a milestone achievement of the Bangsamoro legislative and executive bodies;

**WHEREAS**, the proposed BRAD program is initially composed of six (6) major components, subject to the final assessment and enhancement of the proposed program by a pool of experts to be constituted by the Bangsamoro government and the latter’s approval of this final draft, to wit:

1) One industrial or fruit crop production project in every cluster of 500 hectares or a total of 21 clusters in a 7,800-hectare area;
2) Corporate compact farming system composed of cereal crops, vegetable, animal and fishery production in, at least, 100 hectares to have immediate and sustainable sources of food for the program recipients and income for their other daily needs;
3) Social infrastructures and other related centers in a 60-hectare area;
4) Wildlife and vegetation protection project in a 400-hectare area;
5) Road network construction that includes the main and subsidiary roads, and commodity-road web;
6) Cooperative Community Governance Center (CCGC) where the Office of Cooperative Community Affairs (OCCA) will be stationed; and

**WHEREAS**, the implementation of the aforementioned components may be one after the other, depending on the availability of funds from the Bangsamoro Autonomous Government and other national and local sources, and from accessible international donor institutions.

**NOW THEREFORE**, for and in consideration of the forgoing premises, be it

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to request the Bangsamoro Government, through the Honorable Ahod “Al-Hadj Murad” B. Ebrahim, Interim Chief Minister, Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to consider the proposed “Baranibod Resettlement and Development Area (BRAD) program” a priority for families of landless Bangsamoro mujahideen, and the mechanism to build a model Bangsamoro community outside the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region; and to provide administrative, technical and financial assistance therefor, either directly or indirectly or both.

**ADOPTED:**
