**WHEREAS**, Section 13, Article IX of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) categorically states that the Bangsamoro Government shall recognize the vital role of the youth in nation-building, promote and protect their physical, moral, spiritual, and nationalism, encourage involvement in public and civic affairs, and promote mental and physical fitness through sports;

**WHEREAS**, the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education (MBHTE) is the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao’s (BARMM) education ministry, ensuring that quality, accessible, and inclusive education is available for all Bangsamoro, which contributes to shared prosperity and peacebuilding in the region;¹

**WHEREAS**, being the BARMM’s education ministry, it is further mandated by the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) to implement Sections 13 and 20 of Article IX of the said law;

**WHEREAS**, the MBHTE conducted the 2023 Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao Athletic Association (BARMMAA) Meet with the theme “Sustaining the Gains of Peace and Unity Through Sports” on May 25 to 29, 2023 in Cotabato City which brought together athletes from all across the Bangsamoro Region;²

**WHEREAS**, the BARMMAA Meet, an event highly anticipated by sports enthusiasts, is set to provide a platform for the Bangsamoro youth to showcase their inherent talents in various athletic disciplines, and will serve as a stage to exhibit their prowess in the field of sports;³

**WHEREAS**, according to MBHTE Minister Mohagher Iqbal, sports and physical education hold significant importance in the Bangsamoro Region for three main reasons: 1) promoting the health and well-being of learners; 2) imparting essential life lessons; and 3) fostering an environment conducive to genuine peace and reconciliation;⁴
