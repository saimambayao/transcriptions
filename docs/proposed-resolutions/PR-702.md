**A RESOLUTION**
**URGING THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS AND HIGHWAYS – NATIONAL TO FAST-TRACK THE RENOVATION OF QUIRINO BRIDGE IN COTABATO CITY**

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), in accordance with Section 9(3) of Republic Act No. 11054 (Bangsamoro Organic Law), recognizes the inherent right of the Bangsamoro people to self-determination, which includes the right to enjoy public services such as safe and accessible infrastructure, thereby upholding the welfare, safety, and general interest of its constituents;

**WHEREAS**, constructed in the 1950s by the US Bureau of Public Roads and Philippine Public Works, the Quirino Bridge in Cotabato City is not only a vital infrastructure linking key areas of the city, but also a historic landmark that has witnessed decades of the city’s growth and transformation;

**WHEREAS**, the bridge holds symbolic importance for Cotabateños and the Bangsamoro people as a testament to resilience, unity, and progress amidst historical challenges in the region;

**WHEREAS**, over the years, the structure of the bridge has significantly deteriorated, raising concerns on public safety, daily traffic congestion, and limited accessibility, particularly during emergencies and peak hours;

**WHEREAS**, the continued delay in its renovation endangers motorists and pedestrians and hampers socio-economic mobility in Cotabato City and nearby municipalities;

**WHEREAS**, the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) has a responsibility to maintain public infrastructure for public safety and mobility, as stipulated under Executive Order No. 292, s. 1987, which mandates the DPWH to ensure the maintenance of national infrastructure, including bridges and highways;

**WHEREAS**, although infrastructure management in the BARMM has been devolved, the Quirino Bridge remains under the purview of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) – National due to its national importance and funding scope as indicated by Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), which ensures the integration of regional and national infrastructure projects;

**WHEREAS**, despite previous maintenance efforts on the Quirino Bridge, its ongoing structural issues persist, leading to frequent traffic disruptions, especially during peak hours, and diminishing the effectiveness of alternative routes, which continue to face traffic overload as a result;

**WHEREAS**, the delay in addressing the full renovation and permanent repair of the Quirino Bridge poses risks not only to motorists and pedestrians but also to the socio-economic progress of Cotabato City and the surrounding municipalities, impacting trade, emergency response times, and general access to services;

**NOW, THEREFORE**, be it

**RESOLVED** by the BTA Parliament, as it hereby resolves, to urge the Department of Public Works and Highways – National, through Secretary Manuel M. Bonoan, and all concerned regional offices, to fast-track the renovation of the Quirino Bridge in Cotabato City to ensure safe, efficient, and reliable transportation routes for all commuters and businesses;

**RESOLVED, FINALLY**, that a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to the Office of the President of the Philippines, the Secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways, the Regional Office of the DPWH in SOCCSKSARGEN, and the Office of the City Mayor of Cotabato City for their information and immediate appropriate action.
