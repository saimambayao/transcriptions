**RESOLUTION**

**URGING THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT, THROUGH ITS MINISTRIES AND AGENCIES TO STRENGTHEN ITS PARTICIPATION IN THE BRUNEI DARUSSALAM - INDONESIA - MALAYSIA - PHILIPPINES EAST ASEAN GROWTH AREA (BIMP-EAGA) ECONOMIC COOPERATION**

WHEREAS, established in 1994, the Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) cooperation initiative aims to accelerate the socio-economic development of less developed, marginalized, and geographically remote areas in these four countries as part of a broader goal to narrow the development gaps among the participating ASEAN member states;

WHEREAS, the BIMP-EAGA covers the entirety of Brunei Darussalam, the provinces of Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Maluku, and Papua of Indonesia; the states of Sabah and Sarawak and the federal territory of Labuan in Malaysia; and Mindanao and the province of Palawan in the Philippines. The sub-region of Mindanao covers the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

WHEREAS, the BIMP-EAGA cooperation initiative aims to increase trade, tourism, and investment by facilitating the free movement of people, goods and services; making the best use of common infrastructure and natural resources; and taking the fullest advantage of economic complementation;

WHEREAS, given emphasis BIMP-EAGA’s underlying strategy is to mobilize private sector investments with the government (national, regional, provincial, and local) providing facilitative environment and support. To achieve its development goals, the BIMP-EAGA cooperation initiative is anchored on five strategic pillars: connectivity, food basket, tourism, environment, and socio-cultural and education¹;

WHEREAS, with the establishment of the new Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, it becomes imperative to strengthen the participation of the Bangsamoro Government in the BIMP-EAGA economic cooperation initiative with the advantage of BARMM as a fellow Muslim-majority region. Given that BARMM possesses empowered governance and autonomy, alongside the strong support of the National Government through intergovernmental relations bodies, the BARMM can succeed in fully harnessing the East ASEAN Growth Area’s economic, trade and investment potential;

WHEREAS, the intergovernmental policy bodies established by the Organic Law enhances institutional linkages between the national government and the Bangsamoro Government particularly on the following areas: a) Intergovernmental Relations, b) Legislative Initiatives, c) Fiscal Policy Matters, d) Joint Body for the Zones of Joint Cooperation, e) Infrastructure Development, f) Energy Development, and g) Sustainable Development;

WHEREAS, being the only Muslim-majority region in the country, and with the existing rich cultural and historical ties with the BIMP-EAGA member countries, the BARMM can give priority to the promotion of the Autonomous Region as an investment potential hub for Halal Food Industries, *Madaris* Education and Islamic Studies, Infrastructure Development based on the Built Operate Transfer (BOT) scheme, Cultural Tourism and Environment;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Government shall recognize and reactivate its different Working Committees based on the different strategic pillars of the East ASEAN Growth Area, involving the major ministries and agencies of the Bangsamoro Government;

WHEREAS, the comparative advantages and investment potential of the provinces encompassed by the BARMM should also be identified as part of promoting the region on the basis of what the provinces can offer, for example, Tawi-Tawi is the main producer of seaweed in the entire country, where seaweed processing development can be invested to; and

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Government, through its appropriate Committees, should actively participate in all BIMP-EAGA related activities lead by the Mindanao Development Authority (MINDA) within the country, and all activities of the BIMP-EAGA within the East ASEAN Growth Area.

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED** by the BTA Parliament to pass and approve this Resolution urging the Bangsamoro Government, through its ministries and agencies to strengthen its participation in the Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area Economic Cooperation.
