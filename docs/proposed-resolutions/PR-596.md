**RESOLUTION**
**DIRECTING THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH (MOH) TO INTENSIFY ITS PROGRAM ON THE ELIMINATION OF TUBERCULOSIS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM)**

**WHEREAS**, Section 5, Article II of the 1987 Constitution states that the **maintenance of peace and order, the protection of life, liberty, and property, and the promotion of the general welfare** are essential for the enjoyment by all the people of the blessings of democracy;

**WHEREAS**, Section 11 of the same article states that the State **values the dignity of every human person and guarantees full respect for human rights**;

**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Article IV of Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), provides that in the exercise of its right to self-governance, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is free to pursue its political, economic, social and cultural development as provided for in the Organic Law;

**WHEREAS**, Section 3, Article V of the BOL provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are **essential to the promotion of general welfare**. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants;

**WHEREAS**, Republic Act No. 10767, otherwise known as Comprehensive Tuberculosis Elimination Plan Act, was enacted in 2016 to support and expand efforts to eliminate tuberculosis as a public health problem in the Philippines;

**WHEREAS**, *Tuberculosis* or *TB* refers to an infectious but curable disease caused by bacteria called *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. It is transmitted from a TB patient to another through coughing, sneezing, and spitting and while the bacterium usually affects the lungs, it may also affect the bone and other organs like the kidney and the liver¹;

**WHEREAS**, during the regional high-level meeting in collaboration with the Stop TB Partnership and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in Pasay, Manila, Department of Health Secretary Ted Herbosa said that a total of 612,000 TB cases were reported in 2023. This is equivalent to approximately 549 cases per 100,000 population, marking an increase from 439 cases per 100,000 in 2022²;

**WHEREAS**, Dr. Lucia Ditiu, Executive Director of the Stop TB Partnership, also emphasized the urgency to address TB, stating, “Tuberculosis – which is airborne – is not receiving as much attention as COVID-19. We’re all at risk, regardless of color or religion.”³;

**WHEREAS**, during the World TB Day Friday on March 22, 2024, the Department of Health Officer in Charge Maria Rosario Vergeire delivered a speech that while curable, the disease still resulted to over 1.6 million recorded deaths in 2021 and said that about 70 Filipinos die daily from tuberculosis (TB)⁴;

**WHEREAS**, she further stated that, “We are only one of the eight countries that account for two-thirds of the estimated global cases. The Philippines is also the fourth-largest contributor of TB cases at 7 percent of the global total. For every 100,000 Filipinos, an estimated 650 individuals were infected with TB in 2021, a huge difference from our 554 per 100,000 from the year prior.” ⁵;

**WHEREAS**, moreover, she even disclosed that the National Capital Region has reached its target treatment enrolment followed by Calabarzon, Central Luzon, and Western Visayas with high enrolment rates, while the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) and the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) continue to lag⁶;

**WHEREAS**, the National Tuberculosis Control Program⁷, which was organized in 1978 and operating within a devolved health care delivery system, is one of the public health programs for the management of TB. It is managed and coordinated by the Infections Diseases for Prevention and Control Division (IDPCD) of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau (DPCB) of the Department of the Department of Health (DOH);

**WHEREAS**, while TB mostly affects adults in their most productive years, all age groups are at risk⁸;

**WHEREAS**, over 80% of cases and deaths are in low- and middle-income countries⁹;

**WHEREAS**, moreover, TB occurs in every part of the world. In 2022, the largest number of new TB cases occurred in WHO’s South-East Asian Region (46%), followed by the African Region (23%) and the Western Pacific (18%). Around 87% of new TB cases occurred in the 30 high TB burden countries, with more than two-thirds of the global total in Bangladesh, China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan and the Philippines¹⁰;

**WHEREAS**, the treatment for TB is very intensive as the oral antibiotics are to be taken in the span of 4-6 months;

**WHEREAS**, there is an immediate need to intensify and strengthen the program for the elimination of Tuberculosis in the Bangsamoro region;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, as the interim government of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, must make necessary actions and expand its efforts to eliminate or reduce the incidence and mortality rate of TB in the region;

**WHEREAS**, this can be achieved by monitoring the status and progress of TB in the region and most importantly, to intensify the program and develop further the strategies to combat the disease; and

**WHEREAS**, in addition, the Ministry of Health (MOH) is encouraged to launch a campaign using all platforms in order to educate the public regarding the control, treatment, management and other interventional measures in order for every Bangsamoro to protect themselves against the disease.

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the BTA Parliament, to pass and approve this Resolution directing the Ministry of Health to intensify its program on the elimination of tuberculosis in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.

**RESOLVED FURTHER** that a copy of this Resolution be furnished to the Ministry of Health for information and immediate action.

Adopted,
