**RESOLUTION**

**CALLING ON THE MINISTRY OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT (MSSD), THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT (MILG), THE MINISTRY OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES' AFFAIRS (MIPA), AND THE PHILIPPINE STATISTICS AUTHORITY (PSA) TO JOINTLY FORMULATE A REGIONAL PROGRAM FOR THE MANDATORY CIVIL REGISTRATION OF THE BIRTH OF THE RESIDENTS OF THE BANGSAMORO, PARTICULARLY THE SAMA DILAUT/BADJAO AND OTHER INDIGENOUS PEOPLES**

**WHEREAS,** in August 2018, then President Rodrigo Roa Duterte signed into law Republic Act No. 11055, otherwise known as the "Philippine Identification System Act" or the " PhilSys Act," seeking to harmonize and integrate the several government IDs by establishing a single national identification system for all citizens and resident aliens through the collection of basic personal information and biometric data;

**WHEREAS,** one of the legal documents to be presented for registration in the PhilSys is a Certificate of Live Birth issued from the PSA;

**WHEREAS,** the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNCHR), in an article published on its website on January 9, 2019, partly said: "The Philippines, a signatory to the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, has identified the Sama Bajaus as a population at risk of statelessness and the UNCHR had already expressed its apprehension that this could be true and their failure to register in PhilSys will make it difficult for them to claim Filipino Citizenship;

**WHEREAS,** according to the same report: "A birth certificate will help the community assert their rights" and "ensuring birth registration also supports our global initiatives to prevent statelessness." According to its Philippine Representative, Oyunsaikhan Dendevnorov: "Every child/human has the right to a name and identity. Birth registration forms the basis of identity. It has much larger implications for children to have access to education, health care, and social services. This is invaluable for the indigenous population and those at risk of statelessness such as the Sama Bajau";

**WHEREAS,** it is also feared that non-registration could result in deprivation or refusal to afford them basic government services in the future, not to mention the implications on government planning, programming, delivery of basic services, and our elections;

**WHEREAS,** under Section 479 (b) of the Local Government Code (RA 7160), the Local Civil Registrar shall be responsible for the civil registration program in the local government unit concerned;

**WHEREAS,** the Cities of Cebu, Batangas, General Santos, and Davao City are the leaders in actually assisting and facilitating the free registration of the birth records of the Badjao, who are mostly native residents of the Bangsamoro;

**WHEREAS,** according to the result of the 2015 Population Census, the ARMM (now BARMM) had the lowest completeness of birth Birth Registration at 57.5%;

**WHEREAS,** other indigenous peoples living in the Bangsamoro Region are similarly situated as the Badjao in terms of compliance with birth registration requirement;

**WHEREAS,** as a result thereof, the Regional Legislative Assembly passed Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act No. 293, providing free birth registration for residents of the autonomous region;

**WHEREAS,** in view of the PhilSys Act and the risk of the Sama Dilaut/Badjaos and other Indigenous peoples becoming stateless in the future, there is an urgent need to expedite the registration of the residents of the Bangsamoro, especially the Sama Badjaos and other resident-members of the Indigenous Peoples of the Bangsamoro;

**NOW THEREFORE,** be it **RESOLVED,** as it is **HEREBY RESOLVED,** by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament to direct the Ministry of Social Services and Development (MSSD), Ministry of Interior and Local Government (MILG), Ministry of Indigenous Peoples' Affairs (MIPA), Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) to formulate programs to expedite the registration of birth of the residents of the Bangsamoro, especially the Sama Dilaut/Badjau and other Indigenous Peoples;

**RESOLVED FURTHER,** that copies of this resolution be furnished to the MSSD, MILG, MIPA, and other concerned Ministries for information and appropriate consideration.

**ADOPTED,**
