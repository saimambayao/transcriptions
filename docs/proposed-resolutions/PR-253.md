**RESOLUTION**

**URGING THE MINISTRY OF TRADE, INVESTMENT AND TOURISM (MTIT), THE MINISTRY OF TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATION (MOTC), AND THE BANGSAMORO PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY (BPDA) TO INITIATE PROGRAMS AND CONDUCT FEASIBILITY STUDIES TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COMMERCIAL MARITIME AND AIR TRANSPORT PLYING THE ROUTE OF SULU TO ZAMBOANGA CITY**

**WHEREAS**, in recent weeks, the limited number of sea vessels plying the Sulu and Zamboanga route has caused so much inconvenience to the public, as evidenced by people queuing up from two o’clock in the morning to purchase tickets;

**WHEREAS**, Sulu mainland has two existing major seaports, namely Jolo and Luuk ports;

**WHEREAS**, Sulu has two airports, with the Jolo airport categorized as a Principal Class II airport and the airport in the Luuk for small passenger aircraft;

**WHEREAS**, as an island province, Sulu’s connectivity to other parts of the country is made difficult by the limited number of both sea and air travel to and from Sulu with its neighboring Provinces;

**WHEREAS**, with the recent fire incident involving Aleson shipping lines and the indefinite suspension of operation by Weesam fast craft corporation, operating from Zamboanga to Jolo, Sulu, and vice-versa have been reduced to a few available shipping lines, including Montenegro and Ibnerizam;

**WHEREAS**, the high demand for sea travel and the low supply of tickets are compelling travelers to purchase tickets from fixers 1.5 times the price issued by shipping lines ticketing offices and even forcing people to brave the danger of traveling by smaller boats;

**WHEREAS**, many of Sulu’s locals traveling to Zamboanga city and other nearby areas for trade and commerce, studies, and other personal transactions have experienced difficulties due to the volume of passengers which cannot be accommodated by existing sea vessels;

**WHEREAS**, studies show that an increase in the number of maritime and air transport is one of the key contributors to urban growth as it potentially affects all attributes of trips made by residents;

**WHEREAS**, far-flung areas will benefit from the increase of the capacity of the available mode of transportation in the long run because of its potential to connect various cities and municipalities;

**WHEREAS**, with a limited number of both sea and air travels to and from the Province of Sulu, the local economy’s growth is negatively affected;

**WHEREAS**, the conduct of a feasibility study by the concerned Ministries and agencies to determine the possibility of adding more trips via sea and air travel will provide the strategy to attract more local investments, thereby improving the socio-economic condition of the locals and providing the necessary services for trade, tourism, and commerce;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED** by the Bangsamoro Parliament, TO URGE THE MINISTRY OF TRADE, INVESTMENT AND TOURISM (MTIT), THE MINISTRY OF TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATION (MOTC), AND THE BANGSAMORO PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY (BPDA) TO INITIATE PROGRAMS AND CONDUCT FEASIBILITY STUDIES TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COMMERCIAL MARITIME AND AIR TRANSPORT PLYING THE ROUTE OF SULU TO ZAMBOANGA CITY;

**RESOLVED, FINALLY**, that copies of this resolution be furnished to the Ministry of Trade, Investment and Tourism (MTIT), the Ministry of Transportation and Communication (MOTC), the Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority (BPDA), and other concerned agencies or ministries for information and appropriate consideration.
