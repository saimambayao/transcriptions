**A RESOLUTION URGING THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES, AND AGRARIAN REFORM (MAFAR) AND OTHER CONCERNED AGENCIES TO FORMULATE A PROGRAM THAT CAN PROVIDE IMMEDIATE AID TO FARMERS AFFECTED BY HEAT-RELATED AGRICULTURAL CHALLENGES IN THE BANGSAMORO REGION**

**WHEREAS**, Section 5, Article XIII of the 1987 Philippine Constitution states that:

> “**Section 5.** The State shall recognize the right of farmers, farmworkers, and landowners, as well as cooperatives, and other independent farmers' organizations to participate in the planning, organization, and management of the program, and **shall provide support to agriculture through appropriate technology and research, and adequate financial, production, marketing, and other support services.**”

**WHEREAS**, it is enshrined under Republic Act No. 11054 (R.A. No. 11054) or the Bangsamoro Organic Law, that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are **essential to the promotion of general welfare**;

**WHEREAS**, under Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 13, otherwise known as the “Bangsamoro Administrative Code,” it is within the mandate of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Agrarian Reform (MAFAR) to ensure the availability, adequacy, accessibility, and affordability of food supplies at all time in the Bangsamoro;

**WHEREAS**, furthermore, MAFAR is the primary Bangsamoro agency tasked to be responsive to the needs of farmers, fisherfolks, Agrarian reform beneficiaries, stakeholders as well as the transacting public;

**WHEREAS**, based on the latest Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) Heat Index (as of April 21, 2024, 5:00 pm), the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) has a Heat Index of forty-two degrees Celsius (42°C)¹;

**WHEREAS**, the BARMM Region is already considered as part of the “Danger” category, based on the classification threshold adapted by PAGASA from the National Weather Services, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NWS-NOAA);

**WHEREAS**, weather specialist Dr. John Manalo said that since the highest heat index values are usually recorded in May, there is a possibility that temperatures in the country may reach extreme danger levels or temperatures at 52°C or higher, next month²;

**WHEREAS**, agriculture is a critical sector in the Bangsamoro Region, with farmers playing an indispensable role in securing food supplies and maintaining economic stability;

**WHEREAS**, the ongoing extreme heatwaves are causing substantial losses for farmers, including crop failures, livestock deaths, and related challenges, which not only severely affect their livelihoods but also the well-being of farmers and their families, particularly those who are already vulnerable and marginalized;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Government and its agencies must ensure the welfare of its constituents, especially during times of crisis;

**WHEREAS**, MAFAR, together with other concerned agencies, must immediately act to provide relief and assistance to affected farmers to prevent future hardship;

**WHEREAS**, MAFAR is called upon to conduct an assessment of the impact of the heatwave on farmers and the agriculture in the region, and to develop strategies to mitigate these effects, providing both short and long-term solutions;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Parliament of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to **urge the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Agrarian Reform (MAFAR) and other concerned agencies to formulate a program that can provide immediate aid to farmers affected by heat-related agricultural challenges in the Bangsamoro Region.**
