**A RESOLUTION URGING THE COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT, NATURAL RESOURCES, AND ENERGY (CENRE) TO CONDUCT AN INQUIRY, IN AID OF LEGISLATION, ON THE PERSISTENT LOW VOLTAGE SUPPLY AND FREQUENT POWER INTERRUPTIONS BEING EXPERIENCED IN THE PROVINCE OF LANAO DEL SUR, PARTICULARLY IN THE BASAK AREA, IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE PERFORMANCE OF THE LANAO DEL SUR ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE, INC. (LASURECO)**

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Organic Law (Republic Act No. 11054), specifically Article IX, Section 8, mandates the Bangsamoro Government to ensure the delivery of basic services—including power and electricity—to promote equitable access to development and improve the quality of life of its constituents;

**WHEREAS**, the provision of stable, sufficient, and reliable electricity is essential for the effective delivery of public services, economic productivity, public health, safety, education, and overall community welfare;

**WHEREAS**, the following municipalities comprising the Basak Area of Lanao del Sur—namely Ditsaan-Ramain, Bubong, Buadiposo-Buntong, Mulondo, Maguing, Taraka, Tamparan, Lumba-Bayabao, Poona Bayabao, and Masiu—continue to experience persistently low voltage levels and frequent power interruptions, which have severely disrupted daily life and economic activity, and undermined access to basic government services;

**WHEREAS**, the Lanao del Sur Electric Cooperative, Inc. (LASURECO), which holds the legislative franchise to distribute electricity in the province, has repeatedly failed to deliver sufficient voltage supply to many areas, raising questions on its technical capacity, operational efficiency, financial standing, and compliance with regulatory standards;

**WHEREAS**, Lake Lanao and the Agus River system—both located in the Province of Lanao del Sur—generate approximately seventy percent (70%) of the electricity supply used across the entire island of Mindanao; yet, paradoxically, the province suffers from one of the poorest electricity access rates in the country, reflecting a significant mismatch between resource contribution and service delivery, and thereby raising serious questions of equity, distributive justice, and energy governance;

**WHEREAS**, there is an urgent need to examine the root causes of the continuing low voltage problem and frequent power interruptions in the Province of Lanao del Sur particularly in the Basak Area and assess the overall capacity and accountability of LASURECO, in order to recommend appropriate legislative and policy interventions to ensure stable and equitable access to electricity;

**WHEREAS**, the Committee on Environment, Natural Resources, and Energy (CENRE) is empowered to conduct investigations in aid of legislation on matters concerning energy access, electric cooperatives, and utility regulation in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, to urge the Committee on Environment, Natural Resources, and Energy (CENRE) to conduct an inquiry, in aid of legislation, on the persistent low voltage supply being provided by the Lanao del Sur Electric Cooperative (LASURECO) in the Province of Lanao del Sur particularly in the Basak Area;

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, that the Committee be authorized to invite relevant officials and representatives from LASURECO, the National Electrification Administration (NEA), the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources, and Energy (MENRE) local government units, and affected stakeholders, and to gather technical data, audit reports, and service performance records to determine the scope and causes of the issue;

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, that the Committee invite representatives from the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP), National Power Corporation (NPC), Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM), National Electrification Administration (NEA), and the Department of Energy (DOE) to provide technical data, operational updates, and institutional perspectives on the electricity supply situation in the Province of Lanao del Sur;

**RESOLVED FINALLY**, that the Committee submit a comprehensive report with findings and legislative recommendations to the Bangsamoro Parliament, aimed at improving electricity access and ensuring accountability and transparency in the power distribution sector of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

Adopted this ____ th day of __________, 2025, at Cotabato City, Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, Philippines.
