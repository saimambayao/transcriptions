**A RESOLUTION OF THE BTA-PARLIAMENT REQUESTING THE HONORABLE SPEAKER AND THE HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE LOWER HOUSE OF CONGRESS, LIKEWISE THE HONORABLE SENATE PRESIDENT AND THE HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE TO SPONSOR, AND ENACT A LAW CREATING A PROVINCE FOR THE SPECIAL GEOGRAPHIC AREA, BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO**

WHEREAS, the Special Geographic Area, BARMM has been created into eight (8) municipalities, namely: the Municipalities of Pahamuddin, Kadayangan, Nabalawag, Tugunan, Ligawasan, Malidegao, Kapalawan and Old Kaabakan, to be ratified through a plebiscite in the near future;

WHEREAS, to hasten the development in these municipalities and to carry out the normal delivery of basic services to the people, there is an urgent need for a local government unit equal to the level of province that will supervise its affairs similar to other municipalities in the entire country;

WHEREAS, since the turnover of these barangays to the BARMM, up to the present, the SGA now eight (8) municipalities lack the concern of a provincial care taker, it having no governor and no congressman to manage its provincial affairs;

WHEREAS, these municipalities have all the elements sufficient under the Local Government Code of the Philippines in terms of income, land area and number of residents. It is qualified to become a province and have congressional districts;

WHEREAS, many residents in the concerned municipalities are suggesting that once the SGA be created as a province, the name would be **MORO PROVINCE**. This is to bring back to the memory of the people in the proposed province and the entire country in general that Mindanao and Sulu were once created as a unified Moro Province by virtue of Act No. 787, otherwise known as “An Act Providing for the Organization and Government of the Moro Province” passed into law by the Philippine Commission under the authority of the United States on June 1, 1903;

WHEREAS, another group suggested that the same municipalities be called **“KUTA A WATO” PROVINCE**. Fundamental reason in their suggestion is to preserve the historical name of the community in the local dialect of the Maguindanaon.

WHEREAS, on the aforementioned grounds, we proposed that the first priority name of the proposed province be **MORO PROVINCE** and the second priority be **KUTA A WATO PROVINCE**;

WHEREAS, we welcome any member or members of the Lower House of Congress or any member or members of the Senate to sponsor a Bill creating these municipalities into province and, at least, one congressional district.

**NOW THEREFORE, we resolve as we herein resolved to request THE HONORABLE SPEAKER AND THE HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE LOWER HOUSE OF CONGRESS, LIKEWISE THE HONORABLE SENATE PRESIDENT AND THE HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE TO SPONSOR, AND ENACT A LAW CREATING A PROVINCE AND A CONRESSIONAL DISTRICT FOR THE SPECIAL GEOGRAPHIC AREA, BARMM.**
