**RESOLUTION RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING THE JUDICIAL AND BAR COUNCIL (JBC) TO EXEMPT APPLICANTS FOR JUDGESHIP POSITIONS IN THE *SHARI’AH* COURTS WITHIN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM) FROM THE PHILJA’S PRE-JUDICATURE PROGRAM REQUIREMENT**

**WHEREAS**, Section 6, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution provides that the Supreme Court shall have administrative supervision over all courts and the personnel thereof;

**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Article X of the Bangsamoro Organic Law states that the *Shari’ah* Courts within the Bangsamoro territorial jurisdiction shall form part of the Philippine judicial system subject to the supervision of the Supreme Court;

**WHEREAS**, Article 137 of the Presidential Decree No. 1083 states that *Shari’ah* Courts and the personnel thereof shall be subject to the administrative supervision of the Supreme Court;

**WHEREAS**, under Section 8 (5), Article XIII of the Constitution, the authority to recommend appointees to the Judiciary is vested in the Judicial and Bar Council (JBC);

**WHEREAS**, the JBC announced the opening for the application or recommendation for the judgeship positions in Regions IX to XII on 19 May 2023;

**WHEREAS**, all applicants, except those applying for judgeship positions in the *Shari’ah* Circuit Courts (SCCs) outside the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), are required to have undergone, completed, and passed the Pre-Judicature Program (PJP) of the Philippine Judicial Academy (PHILJA) pursuant to Section 2, Rule 3 of the *2020 Revised JBC Rules*;

**WHEREAS**, *Shari’ah*, as a special field of law, applies provisions of Presidential Decree No. 1083, otherwise known as Code of Muslim Personal Laws in the Philippines, as substantive law and a Special Rules of Procedure as procedural law;

**WHEREAS**, the PJP syllabus mostly covers regular Philippine law subjects and not the laws that apply to *Shari’ah* as aforementioned;

**WHEREAS**, exempting applicants to judgeship positions in various *Shari’ah* courts within BARMM from the PJP requirement will encourage competent and qualified candidates to apply and consequently aid in the administration of justice;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, to respectfully request the JBC to exempt applicants for the judgeship positions in the *Shari’ah* Courts within the BARMM from the PHILJA’s Pre-Judicature Program requirement;
