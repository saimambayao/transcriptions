**WHEREAS**, it is the policy of the State as enshrined in the 1987 Philippine Constitution to protect the life, liberty, and property of the people and to maintain peace and order in our community;

**WHEREAS**, on the 21st of August 2023, Monday night, Mr. Mohammad Hessam Midtimbang, 32, host of a Bangsamoro Darul Ifta radio program aired on Gabay Radio 97.7 FM, was about to board his Nissan Almera parked along Governor Gutierrez Avenue, Cotabato City, when a man appeared from behind and shot Mr. Midtimbang several times¹ which resulted to the latter’s tragic death;

**WHEREAS**, besides his work in radio broadcasting, Mr. Midtimbang was also a member of the Bangsamoro Darul Ifta, also known as the House of Opinions, an Islamic advisory council under the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) which promotes cultural and religious solidarity among Muslim, Christians and indigenous non-Moro communities in southern cities and provinces²;

**WHEREAS**, Midtimbang’s death follows the killings of numerous known personalities in the City of Cotabato who were also gunned down in these past few months;

**WHEREAS**, on account of these alarming and senseless series of killings of innocent individuals including Mr. Midtimbang, it is imperative to call upon the concerned government authorities to investigate the incident happened in order to address and resolve the proliferation of these horrendous crimes and to prevent future acts of violence in the region. Moreover, the perpetrators of these crimes should be penalized;

**NOW, THEREFORE**, be it

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, to strongly condemn the horrendous killing of Mr. Mohammad Hessam Midtimbang, express sincere condolences and deep sympathies to his bereaved family, and call upon the Philippine National Police (PRO – BAR), the Ministry of Public Order and Safety (MPOS) and the Nationa Bureau of Investigation (NBI – BARMM) to take all necessary action to suppress the recurring incidents of lawless violence and senseless killings in the City of Cotabato and the whole Bangsamoro Region.
