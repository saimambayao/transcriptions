**RESOLUTION CALLING FOR THE END OF HOSTILITIES AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION OF PALESTINE AND ALLOWING FOR THEIR SAFE RETURN TO THEIR HOMELAND AND THE REHABILITATION THEREOF**

**WHEREAS**, on 7 October 2023, a group of fighters from Hamas’ military arm the Al-Qassam brigades breached and attacked the fortified borders between Gaza and what is now known as Israel¹ in the group’s deadliest attack in decades², resulting in the death of hundreds of Israeli soldiers and civilians;

**WHEREAS**, in response, the government of Israel speaking through its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed retaliation and formally declared war on Hamas³;

**WHEREAS**, what followed were pronouncements from Israeli authorities of “complete siege” of the Gaza strip and the cutting off of electricity, food, water, and fuel supplies therein⁴;

**WHEREAS**, as of 12 October 2023, Israel says it has dropped 6,000 bombs on Gaza weighing 4,000 metric tons in a span of six (6) days⁵;

**WHEREAS**, as of 13 October 2023, 90 educational facilities have been damaged, 11 water sanitation facilities have been destroyed, 19 health centers are not fully operational, 20 ambulances have been hit, 18 places of worship have been damaged including 11 mosques which are completely destroyed, and 64,283 residential units have been damaged with 5,540 of them completed destroyed⁶;

**WHEREAS**, on 13 October 2023, Israel issued an order for the entire 1.1 million population of Gaza north of Wadi Gaza to relocate to the south within the next twenty-four (24) hours – including all United Nations staff and those sheltering in their schools, health centers, and clinics – if they are to be safe from the expected ground offensive⁷;

**WHEREAS**, as of 15 October 2023, 1,300 have been killed in Israel and 2,300 in Gaza⁸;

**WHEREAS**, international humanitarian law under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court considers collective punishment and intentional attacks against civilian populations, attacks against medical units and transports, and attacks against places of worship as war crimes⁹;

**WHEREAS**, while this series of attacks and counter-attacks should not be taken in isolation and should be understood in the broader context of the decades-long assertion of the Palestinian people of their right to self-determination, the crisis in our midst should not be viewed as religious, nor political, but primarily human and humanitarian and should be seen and urgently addressed as such;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it RESOLVED** as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament to call for the end of hostilities and attacks against the civilian population of Palestine, especially in Gaza, and allow their safe return to their homeland, their humane and dignified treatment therein, and the complete rehabilitation thereof.
