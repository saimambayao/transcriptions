**WHEREAS**, the presence of infographic signages encompasses information indicating the name of a particular province, city, or municipality that communicates data relevant to all travelers as well as promotes products common to the area.

**WHEREAS**, signages build structurally sound in the local area that is aesthetically relevant to public utility, improve community image, reduce the liability of blinding the traveler’s location, and is an essential element in the environment and serves as landmark partitioning two adjoining boundaries.

**WHEREAS**, this Proposed Resolution that encourages the Local Government Units to enhance jurisdictional environment, maintain and beautify the area of responsibility, and to provide information to the inhabitant but mostly to the travelers, is in accordance with the letter and spirit of the law enshrined in the Social Welfare Clause of the 1987 Philippine Constitution.
