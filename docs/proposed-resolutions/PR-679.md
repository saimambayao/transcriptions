**WHEREAS**, Section 5, Article II of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides that the maintenance of peace and order, the protection of life, liberty, and property, and promotion of the general welfare are essential for the enjoyment by all the people of the blessings of democracy;

**WHEREAS**, Section 9 of the same Article provides that the State shall promote a just and dynamic social order that will ensure the prosperity and independence of the nation and free the people from poverty through policies that provide adequate social services, promote full employment, a rising standard of living, and an improved quality of life for all;

**WHEREAS**, on March 27, 2014, the Government of the Philippines (GPH) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) signed the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB), marking the end of seventeen (17) years of negotiations between the Parties. This agreement provided a negotiated political settlement aimed at attaining a just and lasting peace and development in the Bangsamoro region¹;

**WHEREAS**, the CAB consolidates and affirms the understanding and commitment between the GPH and MILF. It recognizes the justness and legitimacy of the cause of the Bangsamoro people and their aspiration to chart their political future through a democratic process that will secure their identity and posterity, and allows for meaningful self-governance²;

**WHEREAS**, an integral part of the CAB is the Annex on Normalization, signed on January 25, 2014, which provides a process to ensure human security in the Bangsamoro region. This process enables communities to achieve their desired quality of life through the pursuit of sustainable livelihoods and political participation within a peaceful and deliberative society³;

**WHEREAS**, following the agreements set forth in the CAB, Republic Act No. 11054 or the “Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao,” was signed into law on July 27, 2018, and ratified through plebiscites held on January 21 and February 6, 2019⁴;

**WHEREAS**, the process outlined in the Annex on Normalization is parallel and complementary to the provisions of RA No. 11054⁵;

**WHEREAS**, the National Government recognizes that normalization is a process through which communities can achieve their desired quality of life within a peaceful and deliberative society. To this end, the National Government adopts a multi-faceted Normalization Program that covers aspects of security, socio-economic development, sustainable livelihood, political participation, confidence-building, and transitional justice and reconciliation⁶;

**WHEREAS**, the Normalization Program covers the six (6) recognized MILF camps, particularly Camp Bilal in Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur, Camp Omar Ibn Al-Khattab and Camp Badr in Maguindanao, Camp Rajamuda in North Cotabato and Maguindanao, and Camp Abubakar as-Siddique in Maguindanao⁷;

**WHEREAS**, under the normalization track, the transformation starts after the decommissioning process, which includes the verification and registration of combatants by the Independent Decommissioning Body. Subsequently, decommissioned combatants are turned over to the Task Force for Decommissioned Combatants and their Communities for the general intake process, which includes biometrics registration, socioeconomic profiling, and needs assessment⁸;

**WHEREAS**, the decommissioned combatants are provided identification cards and 100,000 pesos in transitional cash assistance as part of the socioeconomic development programs. This cash assistance is designed to address the basic needs of the decommissioned combatants and their families⁹;

**WHEREAS**, as of August 10, 2023, a total of 26,145 MILF combatants and 4,625 of their firearms have been successfully decommissioned since 2015 by the Independent Decommissioning Body (IDB), which is tasked with implementing the decommissioning process¹⁰;

**WHEREAS**, the implementation of the decommissioning process of the MILF forces is guided by the roadmap of the CAB, specifically in the Annex on Normalization, which is agreed upon by the GPH and the MILF¹¹;

**WHEREAS**, the implementation of normalization initiatives has faced challenges that are being continually addressed by the government through collaborative efforts with its local and national line agencies, as well as international partners. These efforts share the common goal of sustaining the gains of peace process initiatives in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM)¹²;

**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Article IV of Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), specifically provides that in the exercise of its right to self-governance, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is free to pursue its political, economic, social, and cultural development as provided for in the BOL;

**WHEREAS**, Section 3, Article V of the BOL provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare;

**WHEREAS**, it is vital for the Bangsamoro Government to have focused direction and dedicated leadership for the successful implementation of the normalization initiatives embodied in the Annex on Normalization of the CAB;

**WHEREAS**, the creation of a Minister for Normalization Initiatives (MNI) within the Office of the Chief Minister (OCM) would provide a focused framework for synchronizing efforts and coordination among various stakeholders, including government agencies, non-government organizations, civil society organizations, and international partners, in the implementation of normalization initiatives in the BARMM;

**WHEREAS**, the Minister for Normalization Initiatives (MNI) shall serve as the overall in-charge of overseeing the implementation of normalization initiatives embodied in the Annex on Normalization of the CAB;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the Bangsamoro Parliament to pass and approve this Resolution urging the Chief Minister to create an additional minister position within the Office of the Chief Minister (OCM) to champion and oversee the Bangsamoro Government’s support for the National Government’s normalization initiatives in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).
