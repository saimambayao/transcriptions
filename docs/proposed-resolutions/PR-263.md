**DIRECTING THE MINISTRY OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT (MSSD) TO APPRISE THE BANGSAMORO TRANSITION AUTHORITY (BTA) PARLIAMENT ON THE STATUS OF THE TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS (TIPs) IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION AND THE PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES BEING IMPLEMENTED BY THE MINISTRY**

**WHEREAS**, Section 5, Article II of the 1987 Constitution provides that the maintenance of peace and order, the protection of life, liberty, and property, and the promotion of the general welfare are essential for the enjoyment by all the people of the blessings of democracy;

**WHEREAS**, Section 11, of the aforementioned article provides that the State values the dignity of every human person and guarantees full respect for human rights;

**WHEREAS**, Section 3, Article V of R.A. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants;

**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Article XVI of the BOL states that the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) is the interim government in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region during the transition period;

**WHEREAS**, the Ministry of Social Services and Development (MSSD) is the agency mandated to provide a balanced and responsive approach to social welfare whereby the rights, needs, and interests of all citizens within its jurisdiction, with special focus on the marginalized and vulnerable sectors, including women, children, senior citizens, differently-abled persons, indigenous cultural communities, internally displaced persons, and those similarly situated by analogy, are protected and addressed at all times, especially during the existence of a crisis, whether natural or human-induced, that affects their well-being and their participation in community affairs¹;

**WHEREAS**, President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. has ordered the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking (IACAT) and the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC) to strengthen and harmonize the efforts that address human trafficking concerns in the country. He emphasized that human trafficking activities could compromise the country’s economy and national security²;

**WHEREAS**, the 2018 Global Slavery Index report shows a significant rise in the number of victims of human trafficking in the Philippines. Most notable was a recent incident of involving 13 minors, including a two-month-old baby, who were trafficked by their own relatives. Significantly, these minors were subsequently rescued by operatives of the National Bureau of Investigation. This incident is one among many that occur until today, where the Philippines is in the 12th rank among countries with the highest incidence of modern-day slavery in the entire Asia-Pacific³;

**WHEREAS**, the same report provides that among the 44 million people trafficked across the globe, 73% were victims of forced sexual exploitation; 68% were victims of forced labor; 64% were victims of labor exploitation; while 42% led to forced marriages;

**WHEREAS**, according to the July 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report, the Philippines has maintained its Tier 1 ranking for seven consecutive years, the highest in the US State Department's four-tier placements;

**WHEREAS**, the same report covers government efforts undertaken from April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2022. During this period, the Philippine government identified a total of 1,802 trafficking victims, higher than the 1,534 recorded in 2020⁴;

**WHEREAS**, even though the Philippines kept the ranking in the highest tier, this does not necessarily mean that the country resolved its problems on human trafficking. It only means that the government fully meets the minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro government must double and maximize its efforts in monitoring and investigating the cases of human trafficking within the region;

**WHEREAS**, despite the efforts of the government by frequently reminding all overseas job applicants to follow the proper and legal process in seeking overseas employment, cases of human trafficking continue to persist;

**WHEREAS**, updates on the status of the trafficking in persons within the Bangsamoro region can help aid policy measures and help in evaluating the policies and programs to stop or lessen the cases of human trafficking in the region.

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the Parliament, to pass and approve this Resolution directing the MSSD to apprise the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) Parliament on the status of trafficking in persons (TIP) in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region and the programs and initiatives being implemented by the Ministry.

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, to forward this Resolution to the MSSD for information and appropriate action.
