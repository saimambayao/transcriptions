**WHEREAS,** the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) has projected that the inflation rate for January 2024 will fall within the range of 2.8 to 3.6 percent;

**WHEREAS,** according to the BSP, the rise in prices are the increased costs of certain agricultural products such as rice, meat, fruits, and fish. Additionally, the surge in petroleum prices, electricity and water rates, annual adjustments in sin taxes, and the depreciation of the peso are also exerting upward pressure on prices;

**WHEREAS,** Ramadhan will commence no later than 10th of March this year;

**WHEREAS,** during the month of Ramadhan, the prices of commodities are further aggravated by the usual surge. This attributed to several factors that contribute to the increase in demand and subsequently drive-up prices;

**WHEREAS,** the increase in prices will not only impact Muslims observing the holy month of Ramadan but also all inhabitants of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS,** providing additional allowance to BARMM employees will alleviate the financial burden faced by the Bangsamoro Government employees amidst the rising prices during the holy month of Ramadhan;

**WHEREAS,** the Bangsamoro Government had previously granted similar relief allowance in the past years to its constituents and aims to alleviate their financial difficulties during the month of Ramadhan;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to request the Office of the Honorable Chief Minister to grant inflation relief assistance not exceeding Ten Thousand Pesos (₱ 10,000) to all employees in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Government of whatever status including persons engaged under contracts of service and job orders, to be released during the month of Ramadhan 1445, subject to availability of funds.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER,** to forward this Resolution to the Honorable Chief Minister Ahod Balawag Ebrahim, for his information and appropriate action.

Adopted,
