**A RESOLUTION**
**CONSTITUTING THE STATUTORY COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RIGHTS, AMENDING FOR THAT PURPOSE, SECTION 3, RULE XII OF RESOLUTION NO. 268, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE PARLIAMENTARY RULES, PROCEDURES, AND PRACTICES OF THE BANGSAMORO TRANSITION AUTHORITY PARLIAMENT**

**WHEREAS**, as a member state of the United Nations (UN), the Philippines has pledged in cooperation with the UN to promote universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms;

**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Article V of RA 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) enumerates the powers of the Bangsamoro Government, which includes the exercise of authority over human rights. This is further emphasized so that the Bangsamoro Government shall fully respect human rights through Article IX, Section 5 of the same law;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Government is bound by the BOL to adhere to norms and standards of international law and agreements, such as the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of the Indigenous Peoples and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights;

**WHEREAS**, the value of human rights in a post-conflict situation in the Bangsamoro is essential in sustaining peace in the region, and because the BOL enables the creation of a Bangsamoro Human Rights Commission. In fact, the first law to have been enacted by the interim Bangsamoro Government is the creation of such a commission through the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 1;

**WHEREAS**, amid the breakthrough in achieving peace, instances of indiscriminate shelling by state forces of Moro communities continuously displace, if not kill and maim, individuals and families;

**WHEREAS**, over the years, reports on non-compliance with the ceasefire agreement, especially in the conduct of law enforcement in Bangsamoro communities, have led to atrocities and needless deaths;

**WHEREAS**, an alleged human rights violation occurred following a military operation at Datu Paglas town in Maguindanao del Sur last June 18, 2023. A similar incident transpired on December 29, 2021, at Gokotan village in Pikit, North Cotabato where witness testimonies point out to the enforcement as a rubout.

**WHEREAS**, last February 13, 2023, an election officer of Maguindanao was slain in Lambayong, Sultan Kudarat. A day after, February 14, a thirteen-year-old boy died from a shooting incident in Pikit, North Cotabato.

**WHEREAS**, the displacement of indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities such as the Sama Badjao in the Bangsamoro region need closer assessment.

**WHEREAS**, the human rights condition in the Bangsamoro Region merits a closer and more in-depth inspection. Thus, this resolution proposes to create a sole and intended committee allowing the parliament to put more focus on the concerned policies and oversight. A comprehensive approach to promoting human rights will, in many ways, augment the capacity of the existing human rights Commission;

**WHEREAS**, the very foundation of the struggle of the Bangsamoro people is based on the ideals of freedom and justice. Human rights is an integral part of the people’s aspirations;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, that Section 3, Rule XII of Resolution No. 268 be amended to add the following provision in its enumeration:

   **“(18) Committee on Human Rights.** – The Committee on Human Rights shall have seventeen (17) Members. It shall have jurisdiction on all matters relating to human rights in the BARMM and its people, religious freedom, transitional justice, and reparation.”

**BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED**, to constitute the statutory committee on human rights, amending for that purpose Section 3, Rule XII of Resolution No. 268, otherwise known as the Parliamentary Rules, Procedures, and Practices of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament.

Adopted,
