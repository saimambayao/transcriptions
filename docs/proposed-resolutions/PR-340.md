**A RESOLUTION URGING LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNITS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION TO PRIORITIZE AND CHAMPION THE 10-YEAR SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN TO SAFEGUARD THE ENVIRONMENT AND ENSURE THE WELL-BEING OF FUTURE GENERATIONS**

**WHEREAS,** Republic Act No. 11054, also known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law, mandates the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to uphold sustainable development and environmental protection principles;

**WHEREAS,** Article V Section II(f) of Republic Act No. 11054 empowers the Bangsamoro government to exercise authority over ecological solid waste management and pollution control;

**WHEREAS,** on September 3, 2021, the Bangsamoro Economic and Development Council (BEDC) approved the establishment of the Sub-Committee on Regional Solid Waste Management (SCRSWM) under the Regional Land Use Committee (RLUC) to serve as the policy-making body for solid waste management in the Bangsamoro region;

**WHEREAS,** the SCRSWM is responsible for developing the Bangsamoro Solid Waste Management Framework, assisting local government units (LGUs) in formulating their Local Solid Waste Management Plans, and reviewing, monitoring, and assessing these plans, including approving Solid Waste Management Plans of provinces, cities, and municipalities in the Bangsamoro region;

**WHEREAS,** the SCRSWM plays a crucial role in formulating and updating the regional solid waste management plan, promoting and coordinating solid waste management efforts, monitoring and enforcing compliance, providing capacity building and technical assistance, and fostering collaboration and coordination with stakeholders in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS,** the active participation and commitment of LGUs in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, in collaboration with the SCRSWM, are vital in championing and advancing solid waste management practices aligned with sustainable development principles and environmental conservation;

**WHEREAS,** empowering and utilizing the SCRSWM enables LGUs to enhance their capacity to address solid waste issues, strengthen coordination efforts, and effectively implement sustainable waste management strategies that will safeguard the environment and contribute to the well-being of future generations;

**WHEREAS,** the proper implementation of waste management plans is essential to address environmental issues associated with solid waste generation, including pollution, public health hazards, degradation of natural resources, and increased risk of flooding;

**WHEREAS,** improper waste disposal contributes to the blockage of drainage systems in the flood-prone Bangsamoro region, exacerbating the risk of floods during heavy rainfall;

**WHEREAS,** ensuring proper waste disposal practices, including the establishment of sanitary landfills, can mitigate the environmental impact of flooding, protect public health, safeguard the integrity of natural resources, and secure a better future for generations to come;

**WHEREAS,** the Status of compliance with the 10-year Solid Waste Management Plan and Sanitary Landfill¹ reveals that out of 124 LGUs in BARMM, only 44 LGUs have an approved plan, while 53 are under evaluation, and a total of 27 LGUs did not submit their plan;

**WHEREAS,** prioritizing the 10-year Solid Waste Management Plan as a top priority of LGUs contributes to fulfilling the components of Republic Act No. 11992, the Seal of Good Local Governance Act of 2019, emphasizing the importance of effective waste management in local governance and the responsibility to protect the environment for the well-being of present and future generations;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,** by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA), to call upon all LGUs within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to prioritize and champion the development and implementation of the 10-year Solid Waste Management Plan in accordance with Republic Act No. 9003, in compliance with the component of Republic Act No. 11992, and in accordance with the mandate of environmental protection for the well-being of present and future generations under the Bangsamoro Organic Law.

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED,** that the Bangsamoro Transition Authority urges all concerned agencies, particularly the Sub-Committee on Regional Solid Waste Management (SCRSWM), chaired by the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources and Energy (MENRE), the Ministry of Interior and Local Government (MILG) as its vice chair, and the Provincial Local Government Units in Bangsamoro region, to provide the necessary support, facilitation, and technical assistance to the LGUs in the formulation and execution of their Solid Waste Management Plans and to develop appropriate strategies and interventions to address these issues effectively.

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED,** that the Bangsamoro Transition Authority calls for increased public awareness and participation in solid waste management initiatives, including education campaigns, community engagement programs, and advocacy activities, to foster a culture of responsible waste management and environmental stewardship among the residents of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.
