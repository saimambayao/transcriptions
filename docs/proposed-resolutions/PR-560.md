**A RESOLUTION COMMENDING PDEA-BARMM, UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF REGIONAL DIRECTOR GIL CESARIO P. CASTRO, FOR THE SERIES OF SUCCESSFUL ANTI-ILLEGAL DRUG OPERATIONS IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF BARMM**

**WHEREAS,** by virtue of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 (R.A. No. 9165), the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) was created for the efficient and effective law enforcement of all the provisions on dangerous drugs and/or precursors and essential chemicals as provided under said law.

**WHEREAS,** the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) - BARMM, under the leadership of Regional Director Gil Cesario P. Castro, has conducted more than twenty (20) anti-illegal drug operations from January to March 2024.

**WHEREAS,** with the overall volume of anti-illegal drug operations, the PDEA was able to confiscate huge quantities of suspected illegal drugs, valued at the millions, with the apprehension of suspects, and the dismantling of several drug dens.

**WHEREAS,** the PDEA record shows that the operations resulted in the confiscation of a total of Seven Thousand Eight Hundred Forty-One point Four Hundred Seventy-Six (7,841.476) grams of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride (Shabu) with an estimated value of **Sixty-Two Million Seven Hundred Thirty-One Thousand Eight Hundred Eight Pesos (Php 62,731,808.00)**¹; More or less 15,000 pcs of fully-grown marijuana; and More or less 50 grams of dried marijuana with an estimated value of Twenty-Five Thousand Pesos (Php 25,000.00).

**WHEREAS,** the same operations further resulted in the apprehension of thirty-two (32) suspected drug personalities and the dismantling of four (4) drug dens.

**WHEREAS,** the continuous efforts of PDEA-BARMM have led to successful anti-illegal drug operations wherein neither severe injuries nor death on either side of the government operating team and the group of persons subject to the operations. The confiscation of the illegal substance, as well as the arrest of the perpetrators, ultimately benefits the constituents of the Bangsamoro region and saves Bangsamoro youths from the various negative effects of the same.

**WHEREAS,** The agency's exceptional performance has advanced the government's campaign against illegal drugs.

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Parliament of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to commend PDEA-BARMM, under the leadership of Regional Director Gil Cesario P. Castro, for the series of successful anti-illegal drug operations in different areas of BARMM.
