**RESOLUTION**

**URGING BOTH THE TWO GREAT HOUSES OF THE PHILIPPINE CONGRESS, SPECIFICALLY THE SENATE BLUE RIBBON COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTIVE’S GOOD GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY COMMITTEE, TO CONDUCT AN INQUIRY IN AID OF LEGISLATIONS ON THE ANNUAL HAJJ (PILGRIMAGE) ISSUES AND PROBLEMS, ADMINISTERED AND SUPERVISED BY THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON MUSLIM FILIPINOS, THROUGH ITS BUREAU OF PILGRIMAGE AND ENDOWMENT**

**WHEREAS**, performance of the *Hajj* or pilgrimage to Mecca, Kingdom Saudi Arabia (KSA), is among the five (5) pillars completing the Islamic faith. Muslims from all walks of life all around the globe see this as a lifetime dream;¹

**WHEREAS**, under R.A. No. 9997, the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF), through its Bureau of Pilgrimage and Endowment (BPE), shall be primarily responsible for the administration of the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as well as the formulation and implementation of programs, projects and activities for the efficient and effective administration and supervision of the conduct of pilgrimage activities;²

**WHEREAS**, despite the formulation and implementation of programs and alike activities, the administration and supervision of the NCMF, thru the BPE, on the annual *Hajj* (pilgrimage) is still evidently inefficient and ineffective rendering apparent issues and problems which resulted to suffering and financial losses of the innocent and pitiful pilgrims;

**WHEREAS**, some of these issues and problems encountered by the pilgrims are the following:

1. The delay of the issuance of *hajj* visas incident in 2022 which left the pilgrims leap into the breach in booking another plane tickets to Mecca, KSA, roughly in the amount of **Php 60,000.00**, at their expense, on top of other expensive expenses incurred in Manila during such delay considering the fact that majority of the pilgrims are not from Manila, but from the remote provinces of Mindanao;

2. The inhumane food supply and accommodation incident in 2023 (including the pilgrims’ resting place in *Mina* and *Muzdalifah*) provided to the pilgrims considering their age and health condition, as well as the scorching weather very unusual to the Muslim-Filipino pilgrims;

3. The commission’s gross negligence regarding the transport of pilgrims from Mecca to Jeddah International Airport which resulted to the abandonment of more or less seventy (70) pilgrim passengers by their supposed flight;

All these unfortunate experiences, among others, taking into account the pilgrims’ payment of *Mutawwif* in the amount of more or less **Php 320,000.00 per hujjaj**. Not to mention also the collection of fees from the selected entourage³ members which is supposedly at the full expense of the Commission appropriated from the fund provided by the National Government;

**WHEREAS**, the issues and problems mentioned in the immediately preceding paragraph have not only plagued the pilgrims physically and financially, but also emotionally and mentally;

**WHEREAS**, there is an urgent need to determine the root of these undying *Hajj* issues and problems which put every pilgrims in an inhumane situation, and also to determine who shall be held liable to finally put an end to the blame-shifting between NCMF, the respective service providers from KSA contracted to by the NCMF thru BPE, as well as other persons involved in pursuing the continuance of the annual *Hajj* even with poor *hajj* crisis management, and ascertain possible breaches and negligence, if there’s any;

**WHEREAS**, aside from the need to implement remedial measures to address all the lapses during the conduct of the annual *Hajj*, it is also equally important to look into long-term solutions to the issues and problems posed as it is capable of repetition yet evading review especially⁴ so that the *Hajj* is certainly and definitely conducted annually;

**WHEREAS**, the calling for a legislative measure regarding the *Hajj* issues and problems is nothing more than just asking for an honest and truthful improvement of the services of the concerned Commission, most especially the annual *Hajj* operations, to prevent repetitive damage to the respective pilgrims, and also to faithfully preserve and develop their well-being;

**NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED, BY THE BANGSAMORO PARLIAMENT**, to urge both the two great houses of Philippine Congress, specifically the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee as well as the House of Representative’s Good Government And Public Accountability Committee, to conduct an inquiry in aid of legislations on the annual *Hajj* issues and problems, administered and supervised by the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos, through its Bureau of Pilgrimage and Endowment.
