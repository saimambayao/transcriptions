**WHEREAS**, there have been many instances of Muslims eating pork accidentally or mistakenly that had resulted in unfortunate incidents and squabbles;

**WHEREAS**, these incidents may be avoided if there is proper labeling or notice of “With Pork” or “No Pork” in food establishments;

**WHEREAS**, according to the 2020 census conducted by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), approximately six (6) percent of the country’s population is Muslim;

**WHEREAS**, based on the 2015 Census of the population (2015 POPCEN), Mindanao had a total population of more than 24 million as of August 1, 2015, About 23.39% of which were reported to be followers of Islam. This indicated that in 2015, two in every ten (10) persons in Mindanao were Muslims²;

**WHEREAS**, the Muslim population in Mindanao was concentrated in BARMM. About 91.28% of the total population of the region were Muslims³;

**WHEREAS**, given the Muslim population in BARMM, it is only proper for all food establishments in the Bangsamoro Region to make a disclosure to their customers or patrons by means of signage on their menu and food display counters whether their food contains or does not contain pork;

**WHEREAS**, one of the effective ways to make such disclosure is by displaying a “No Pork” or “With Pork” signage on their menu and food display counters within their business establishments;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED, BY THE BANGSAMORO PARLIAMENT, TO URGE ALL FOOD ESTABLISHMENTS IN THE BANGSAMORO REGION TO DISPLAY “NO PORK” OR “WITH PORK” SIGNAGE ON THEIR MENU AND FOOD DISPLAY COUNTERS.**
