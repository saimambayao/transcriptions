**Proposed Resolution No. 636**

**Introduced by Hon. Omar Yasser C. Sema**

**RESOLUTION EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE BANGSAMORO TRANSITION AUTHORITY ON THE PROPRIETY OF EXTENDING THE BANGSAMORO TRANSITION PERIOD TO PAVE THE WAY FOR A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF ALL SIGNED PEACE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PHILIPPINES AND THE MORO ISLAMIC LIBERATION FRONT (MILF) AND MORO NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (MNLF) IN LIGHT OF THE SUPREME COURT RULING ON THE EXCLUSION OF THE PROVINCE OF SULU FROM BARMM**

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is undergoing a transition period in accordance with the provisions of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), also known as Republic Act No. 11054, to pave the way for the establishment of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), which includes the transition from the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) to a fully functional BARMM government;

WHEREAS, the establishment of a functional autonomous government with a definite territorial jurisdiction are two of the many indispensable elements of the transition period in accordance with the 2014 Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (2014 CAB) between the Government of the Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (GPH-MILF), and the 1996 Final Peace Agreement (1996 FPA) and the mother peace agreement the 1976 Tripoli Agreement (1976 TA) between the Government of the Philippines, Moro National Liberation Front, and Organization of Islamic Cooperation (GPH/GRP-MNLF-OIC);

WHEREAS, after the ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law in January 21, 2019, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front is leading the transition government, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, in accordance with the 2014 CAB while the Moro National Liberation Front is actively participating in the transition period in accordance with the Jeddah Communique of the GPH-MNLF-OIC Tripartite Review of the Implementation of the 1996 Final Peace Agreement;

WHEREAS, the transition period does not concern only the political provisions of the signed peace agreements but more importantly the decommissioning and transformation of all MILF and MNLF Combatants who are significantly present in the entire Bangsamoro geographic area;

WHEREAS, the Supreme Court, in a ruling dated September 9, 2024, in the case of *Provincial Government of Sulu v. Executive Secretary*, declared the exclusion of the Province of Sulu from the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, which has created legal, administrative, territorial and political uncertainties that significantly impact the ongoing transition process within the region and the national peace process;

WHEREAS, the Supreme Court ruling has caused confusion, opened old wounds and disrupted the transition period which is in culminating stages leading to the first Parliamentary elections in 2025;

WHEREAS, the exclusion of Sulu from BARMM necessitates a thorough reassessment of the territorial jurisdiction, governance structures, resource-sharing arrangements, and legislative frameworks that have been established under the BOL and later under regional legislations enacted by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament;

WHEREAS, despite significant progress in institutional development and the swift passage of the priority legislations that paved the necessary reforms and governance structures required to ensure the smooth transition to a regular, fully functional Bangsamoro government all these accomplishments are going down the drain in light of the exclusion of Sulu from the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

WHEREAS, while the exclusion of Sulu is a major setback in establishing a definite Bangsamoro region in accordance with the peace agreements, the impact on the decommissioning and transformation of combatants in Sulu is consciously or unconsciously disregarded;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority’s powers are expansive, the solutions available are out of its control but more under the competence of the parties to the signed peace agreements;

WHEREAS, since the solutions to the effects of the Supreme Court resolution are all hinged on all the signed peace agreements a comprehensive review of implementation of all agreements are desirable and more advantageous in order to arrive at comprehensive response;

WHEREAS, in order for the parties to the peace agreements can conduct a smooth review of the implementation of all signed peace agreements to arrive at an acceptable remedy to the stigma of the Sulu exclusion, extending the transition period is necessary for the parties to engage each other, look at the possible scenarios and impact of the Supreme Court pronouncement on the peace processes without flushing down the accomplishments during the transition period;

WHEREAS, in order that the Bangsamoro Transition Authority can do the necessary recalibration of the institutional and administrative arrangements, and legislative enactments prior to the Supreme Court pronouncement, adequate time is likewise necessary to ensure that the recalibration continue to be in accord with the Bangsamoro Organic Law and within the letter and spirit of the signed peace agreements, thereby preventing disruptions in governance, service delivery and peace and order within the region;

WHEREAS, the extension of the transition period would also ensure that unresolved security, socio-economic, and governance challenges are adequately addressed, especially in conflict-affected areas like Sulu, ensuring lasting peace and sustainable development in the region;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority expresses its commitment to engage in continued dialogue with key stakeholders, including the national government, the provincial government of Sulu, civil society, and international partners, to ensure that the concerns of all affected parties are addressed and that the peace process remains on track, and

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament expressing its sense on the propriety of extending the Bangsamoro Transition Period to pave the way for a comprehensive review of all signed peace agreements between the Government of the Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) in light of the Supreme Court ruling on the exclusion of the Province of Sulu from BARMM.

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, that copies of this resolution be forwarded to the Office of the President of the Republic of the Philippines, the Senate of the Philippines, the House of Representatives, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), the Office of the Presidential Adviser on Peace, Reconciliation, and Unity (OPAPRU), and other concerned agencies for their support and appropriate action.

Adopted,
