**A RESOLUTION**

**URGING THE APPROPRIATE MINISTRIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNITS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO TO STRENGTHEN THE TESTING, EDUCATION, PREVENTION, AND TREATMENT PROGRAMS FOR THE HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS**

**WHEREAS**, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that infects the cells of a person’s immune system and destroys or impairs their function;

**WHEREAS**, HIV weakens a person’s immune system, causing him or her to be more susceptible to infections, including severe Opportunistic Infections and cancers such as lymphoma and Kaposi’s sarcoma;

**WHEREAS**, HIV is transmitted by contact with certain bodily fluids of an infected person, most commonly during unprotected sex or through sharing injection drug equipment;

**WHEREAS**, the body cannot get rid of HIV and that, at present, no cure exists for it— making HIV a lifelong condition requiring continuous management;

**WHEREAS**, without timely diagnosis and treatment, HIV can lead to the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) disease, the most advanced stage of HIV infection;

**WHEREAS**, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the Philippines has the fastest-growing number of HIV cases in the Asia-Pacific Region, with new cases rising dramatically – an approximately 550% increase from 4,400 cases in 2010 to 29,000 in 2025;

**WHEREAS**, as of March 2025, around two hundred fifty two thousand, eight hundred (252,800) Filipinos are living with HIV;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Government considers HIV/AIDS as a serious public health concern that affects all sectors of society regardless of age, gender, or socio-economic status;

**WHEREAS**, Section 22, Article IX of the BOL mandates the Bangsamoro Government to protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them and to uphold the peoples' right to have access to essential goods, health, and other social services that promote their well-being;

**WHEREAS**, the BOL recognizes the authority of the Bangsamoro Government to regulate the affairs of its constituent local government units (LGUs);

**WHEREAS**, early HIV testing and timely treatment remain critical in managing the virus and reducing transmission. Further, voluntary testing is the only way for individuals to know their HIV status due to the absence of specific symptoms;

**WHEREAS**, preventive services such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), counseling, and access to treatment hubs are important tools to reduce HIV transmission and promote healthy living;

**WHEREAS**, data from the Ministry of Health’s Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit shows that the number of HIV cases in the BARMM increased from 85 in 2023 to 565 HIV cases in the first quarter of 2025, which highlights an ongoing public health challenge;

**WHEREAS**, there is only one HIV Treatment Facility in the BARMM, which is at the Datu Halun Sakilan Memorial Hospital in Bongao, Tawi-Tawi;

**WHEREAS**, the persistence of HIV/AIDS in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is driven not only by alarmingly low public awareness but also by entrenched stigma, and limited access to testing and treatment facilities which collectively hinder effective prevention and early intervention efforts;

**WHEREAS**, HIV/AIDS remains a public health imperative that requires active community engagement, leadership, and effective local governance to reduce transmission, promote early diagnosis, and ensure access to treatment;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament to urge the appropriate ministries and LGUs in the BARMM to strengthen the testing, education, prevention, and treatment programs for HIV;

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, to call upon the appropriate ministries and LGUs in the BARMM to ensure the successful implementation of community-based HIV outreach and support services, facilitate continuous data collection and sharing on HIV trends to guide informed decision-making and policy development; and to implement culturally appropriate education campaigns to raise awareness that HIV can affect all people, regardless of identity or background, and emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and treatment;

**RESOLVED FURTHERMORE**, to furnish a copy of this resolution to the appropriate ministries and LGUs in the BARMM for information and appropriate action.
