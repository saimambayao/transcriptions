**WHEREAS**, Section 5, Article II and Section 5, Article III of the 1987 Philippine Constitution respectively provides that, “*The maintenance of peace and order, the protection of life, liberty, and property, and the promotion of the general welfare are essential for the enjoyment by all the people of the blessings of democracy*” and “*No law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof*”;

**WHEREAS**, Section 4 of Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054, also known as Organic Law of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao states that “*The Bangsamoro Government shall guarantee religious freedom and the free exercise thereof pursuant to the Constitution, national laws, and principles of international law. The Bangsamoro Government shall protect all persons from harassment or any undue pressure coercion and violence on account of religion.*”;

**WHEREAS**, Section 4 of Republic Act No. 11479, or the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020, defines terrorism for purposes of acts penalized by the said law as follows:

> “**Section 4. Terrorism** – Subject to Section 49 of this Act, terrorism is committed by any person who, within or outside the Philippines, regardless of the stage of execution:

>
> (b) Engages in acts intended to cause extensive damage or destruction to a government or public facility, public place, or private property;
>

>
> When the purpose of such act, by its nature and context, is to intimidate the general public or a segment thereof, create an atmosphere, or spread a message of fear xxx shall be guilty of committing terrorism and shall suffer the penalty of life imprisonment xxx."

**WHEREAS**, on May 19, 2024, during the observance of Pentecost Sunday, also commemorating the 1991 World Wide Founding Anniversary of the Catholic Church, the serene Liturgy of the Word underway at Sto. Niño Chapel, Purok Bagong Silang, Rosary Heights 3, Cotabato City, was violently interrupted by the detonation of a hand grenade inside the chapel;

**WHEREAS**, according to the Cotabato City Explosive Canine Unit (CECU), initial investigation indicated that a lever from an M-26 hand grenade was found at the scene;

**WHEREAS**, Cotabato City Police Director Colonel Querubin Manalang, Jr. reported that the grenade explosion resulted in injuries of two individuals: Marybel Atis, aged 40, and Rosita Tubilo, a 65-year-old senior citizen, both residents of Rosary Heights 3, Cotabato City;

**WHEREAS**, five months ago, the region experienced similar bombing incidents, notably when a Catholic mass ceremony was disrupted by an explosion at the Mindanao State University (MSU) Gymnasium in Marawi City, resulting in the tragic deaths of four (4) individuals and injuries to fifty (50) others;

**WHEREAS**, on the morning of January 27, 2019, two bombs exploded at Roman Catholic Cathedral of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Jolo, Sulu, claiming the lives of twenty (20) people and eighty (82) injured;

**WHEREAS**, these incidents sparked various speculations across different media platforms regarding its potential causes. One certainty is that this event will sow fear among our constituents, especially the settler communities. Our settler brothers and sisters may now hesitate to attend places of worship or engage in religious practices and activities, fearing for their safety and security within our community. This potential consequence should deeply concern the Bangsamoro government, which is dedicated to preventing such situations. The right to practice one’s religion freely is a fundamental entitlement that every individual should rightfully enjoy;

**WHEREAS**, this resolution aims to put an end to these condemnable acts, recognizing that they are not only illegal but also undermine our endeavors to cultivate a harmonious society. The Bangsamoro government remains resolute in its commitment to safeguarding the safety and security of our constituents as they participate in community activities and endeavor towards peaceful coexistence;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Parliament – Bangsamoro Transition Authority of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to **CONDEMN THE TERRORIST ATTACK ON MAY 19, 2024, AT STO. NIÑO CHAPEL, PUROK BAGONG SILANG, ROSARY HEIGHTS 3, COTABATO CITY AND APPEAL TO THE CONCERNED AUTHORITIES TO EXPEDITE THE INVESTIGATION AND BRING THE PERPETRATOR(S) TO JUSTICE**

**ADOPTED**, May ____, 2024.
