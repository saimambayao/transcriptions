^1 This resolution is patterned from the entry of Mohammad Nasseft Macla in the 2023 Bill and Resolution Drafting Contest conducted by the Offices of MP Engr. Baintan Adil-Ampatuan, MNSA, MP Don Mustapha A. Loong, CESE, MP. Rasul E. Ismael, EMDRCM, and MP Atty.

**WHEREAS,** the global halal food market has been growing continuously over the past years and is projected to continue its development proportionally with the rapid growth of the Muslim population, in which it tallied more than 1.5 trillion dollars in the food product sector alone, and is expected to grow to more than 2.5 trillion dollars in 2027^2, excluding therefrom other lifestyle sectors, such as cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, fashion, Islamic finance, media and recreation, and Muslim-friendly travel;

**WHEREAS,** neighboring Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei both largely contribute to and benefit from the halal industry, noting a remarkably fast Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth since 2020, while non-predominantly Muslim countries, such as Singapore, have also started investing in halal products and services to expand cross-border trade and export;^3

**WHEREAS,** the Republic of the Philippines, mostly for purposes of ensuring its commitment to international trade agreements and harmonization of standards to the global standards, initiated steps including the enactment of Republic Act No. 10817, or the Philippine Halal Export Development and Promotion Act of 2016, which promote the growth, ensures the integrity, and quality of Philippine Halal exports, in recognition of the significant role of export to national economic development, and the potential contribution of Halal industries;

**WHEREAS,** the aforementioned law also emphasizes, among others, the use of police power against trade malpractices, the establishment of a comprehensive development and promotion program, and the creation of a policy-making body that is mandated to set the overall direction of the said program;

**WHEREAS,** while the incorporation of Halal skills development into the technical vocational education training program of the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) is highly commendable, there remains a glaring gap between experts in science and Shari’ah scholars that has to be addressed by the higher education sector that may generally help in the attainment of the objectives of halal promotion and development;

**WHEREAS,** among any other parts of the Philippines, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) should champion the promotion of halal industry in its commitment to food security and faith-based compliance of products and services;

**WHEREAS,** in addition, the region should also open doors for opportunities to boost economic growth, coping with the neighboring developed regions that have already engaged and invested in the industry;

**WHEREAS,** with the integration of the Bangsamoro Halal Board (BHB) into the Ministry of Trade, Investments, and Tourism (MTIT), by virtue of Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 13, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Administrative Code, and the formulation of a 6-year Halal Development Plan, other ministries and offices of the Bangsamoro Government must also collectively work to contribute to the endeavor of halal promotion and development, including the education sector;

**WHEREAS,** the looming growth and the recognition of the halal industry in the country may demand further resources in the future, including and most especially, human resources of those who are in the direct practice of product and service development and also those who are in the field of science-based research;

**WHEREAS,** the development of a degree and graduate studies programs on halal studies can produce individuals that are knowledgeable in the halal industry that may be employed in government agencies and offices that can assist in policy formulations aimed at developing and promoting the principles of halal in the Bangsamoro region;

**WHEREAS,** this is also a long-term solution to halal food security along with the stringent implementation of policies against non-halal food and other products in the region;

**WHEREAS,** moreover, this can also ensure halal quality assurance and the advancement of food science in the region, among others;

**WHEREAS,** the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education (MBHTE), as the primary institution mandated to oversee programs related to education in the region, shall help promote and develop the awareness of principles and concepts of halal in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS,** the Ministry shall likewise include collaborations with other State Universities and Colleges (SUCs), benchmark in universities of other countries that have already offered the course on halal studies, and do other measures and courses of action that may be done in order to develop comprehensive Policies, Standards, and Guidelines (PSG) on halal studies program for higher education, which may be offered in the future by the existing universities and colleges in Bangsamoro or in the Philippines in general, all with the noble intent of producing Bangsamoro scientists and experts on halal industry; and

**WHEREAS,** the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, as the interim government of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, must initiate legislative measures that will benefit not only the present generation but also, and most importantly, the future generation.

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED,** by the BTA Parliament, to pass and approve this Resolution Requesting the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education (MBHTE) – Higher Education Bureau to Initiate Comprehensive Measures for the Formulation of Policies, Standards, and Guidelines (PSG) for a Four-Year Bachelor’s Degree and Three-Year Graduate Studies Program on Halal Studies in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.

**RESOLVED FURTHER,** to furnish a copy of this Resolution to the MBHTE for their perusal and guidance.
