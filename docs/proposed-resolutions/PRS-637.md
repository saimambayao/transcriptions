WHEREAS, Section 18 of the same Article also provides that the Congress shall enact an organic act for each autonomous region which shall define the basic structure of government for the region consisting of the executive department and legislative assembly, both of which shall be elective and representative of the constituent political units;

WHEREAS, Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6734, which became a law on August 1, 1989, governed the creation and operations of the defunct Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) which, in a plebiscite on November 17, 1989, encompassed Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi;

WHEREAS, R.A. No. 9054 which was enacted on March 31, 2001 strengthened, expanded, and amended R.A. No. 6734, which provides for an expanded autonomous region and proposes to include the provinces of Basilan, Cotabato, Davao del Sur, Lanao del Norte, Palawan, Sarangani, South Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, Zamboanga del Sur, and the Province of Zamboanga Sibugay; and the cities of Cotabato, Dapitan, Dipolog, Digos, Koronadal, Tacurong, General Santos, Iligan, Kidapawan, Marawi, Pagadian, Puerto Princesa, and Zamboanga, in a plebiscite called for that purpose in accordance with Section 18, Article X of the Constitution;

WHEREAS, Paragraph 2 of Section 1, Article II of the aforementioned law provides that the plebiscite shall be conducted in the provinces of Basilan, Cotabato, Davao del Sur, Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Palawan, Sarangani, South Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga del Sur and the newly created Province of Zamboanga Sibugay, and (b) in the cities of Cotabato, Dapitan, Dipolog, General Santos, Iligan, Kidapawan, Marawi, Pagadian, Puerto Princesa, Digos, Koronadal, Tacurong and Zamboanga;

WHEREAS, Paragraph (b) of Section 2 of the same Article provides that if the results of the plebiscite in the provinces or cities proposed for inclusion in the expanded area of the autonomous region, a majority of the votes cast in the plebiscite in every province or city in favor of the inclusion of the province or city as members of the expanded area of the autonomous region as provided in this Organic Act shall effect their membership in the autonomous region;

WHEREAS, R.A. No. 9054 took effect following its ratification through a plebiscite on August 14, 2001 wherein six (6) municipalities of Lanao del Norte, thirty-nine (39) barangays in the municipalities of Aleosan, Carmen, Kabacan, Midsayap, Pigkawayan, and Pikit in the Province of North Cotabato; Cotabato City and Isabela City in the Province of Basilan, voted for inclusion in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao;

WHEREAS, R.A. No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) was signed into law on July 27, 2018 by Former President Rodrigo Duterte and repealed R.A. No. 6734 as amended by R.A. No. 9054;

WHEREAS, the BOL was ratified through a plebiscite on January 21, 2019 for the core territories, namely Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu, Basilan and Tawi-Tawi, component cities of Marawi and Lamitan, as well as Cotabato City for its inclusion;¹

WHEREAS, on February 6, 2019, another plebiscite was held in Lanao del Norte, Aleosan, Carmen, Kabacan, Midsayap, Pikit and Pigkawayan towns in North Cotabato and other areas that sought inclusion in the proposed BARMM, leading to the inclusion of the 63 Barangays of North Cotabato;²

WHEREAS, Section 2 (a), Article III of the BOL provides that the territorial jurisdiction of the BARMM, subject to the indispensable plebiscite, shall be composed *inter alia* of the present geographical area known as the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao created under R.A. No. 6734, as amended by R.A. No. 9054 which includes the Province of Sulu;³

WHEREAS, Section 3 (a), Article XV of the BOL provides that the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region shall be established and all provinces and cities of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao created under R.A. No. 6734, as amended by R.A. No. 9054, shall form part of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region if the majority of the votes cast in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao shall be in favor of the approval of this Organic Law: **Provided, That the provinces and cities of the present Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao shall vote as one geographical area**;

WHEREAS, in *Abbas v. COMELEC*, a case concerning the conduct of the plebiscite to ratify R.A. No. 6734, the Supreme Court had occasion to underscore that the will of the majority in each geographical area taking part in the plebiscite for the creation of an autonomous region in Muslim Mindanao determines their inclusion therein, viz.:

> Thus, under the Constitution and R.A. No. 6734, the creation of the autonomous region shall take effect only when approved by a majority of the votes cast by the constituent units in a plebiscite, and only those provinces and cities where a majority vote in favor of the Organic Act shall be included in the autonomous region. The provinces and cities wherein such a majority is not attained shall not be included in the autonomous region. It may be that even if autonomous region is created, not all of the thirteen (13) provinces and nine (9) cities mentioned in Article II, section 1(2) of R.A. No. 6734 shall be included therein. The single plebiscite contemplated by the Constitution and R.A. No. 6734 will therefore be determinative of (1) whether there shall be an autonomous region in Muslim Mindanao and (2) which provinces and cities, among those enumerated in R.A. No. 6734, shall comprise it.⁴

WHEREAS, during the Bangsamoro Organic Law Plebiscite in 2019, the Statement of Voters showed Maguindanao had 599,581 ‘yes’ votes and 9,096 ‘no’ votes; Lanao Del Sur, 503,420 yes and 9,735 no; Sulu, 137,630 yes and 163,526 no; Basilan, 147,598 yes and 6,486 no; and Tawi-Tawi, 151,788 yes and 9,907 no;⁵

WHEREAS, in the case of *Province of Sulu, et al. v. Medialdea, et al.*, G.R. Nos. 242255, 243246, and 243693, promulgated on September 9, 2024, the Supreme Court has upheld the validity of Republic Act No. 11054 or the BOL but declared the Province of Sulu as not part of the BARMM after the province rejected the law's ratification;⁶

WHEREAS, in the same case, the Court declared unconstitutional the interpretation of the provision in the law directing the provinces and cities of ARMM to vote as one geographical unit, as it included provinces that did not vote to be included. It ruled that such interpretation violated Article X, Section 18 of the Constitution, which states that only provinces, cities, and geographic areas voting favorably in the plebiscite shall be included in the autonomous region;⁷

WHEREAS, according to the said Supreme Court decision, since Sulu rejected the Bangsamoro Organic Law in the plebiscite, it was wrong to include the province in BARMM;⁸

WHEREAS, majority of the Bangsamoro ministries, offices, and agencies have established provincial, district, and/or municipal offices in the province of Sulu;

WHEREAS, these provincial, district, and/or municipal offices have assigned thousands of personnel to deliver the various services, programs, and projects of the Bangsamoro Government for the constituents of the province;

WHEREAS, the positions and plantilla of these personnel were created and funded by the Bangsamoro Government;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Government has been allocating annual budget and implementing services, programs, and projects in the province of Sulu since its creation in 2019;

WHEREAS, there are ongoing constructions of various infrastructure projects and implementation of soft projects from the various ministries, offices, and agencies of the Bangsamoro Government;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Government’s regional development plan, land area, population, income, laws, policies, structures, and mechanisms will be greatly affected by the Supreme Court decision;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Government has physical assets in the province of Sulu that need to be accounted for and turned-over to appropriate body or agency;

WHEREAS, it is vital to conduct a comprehensive study on the implications and effects of the separation of the Province of Sulu from the BARMM particularly in its political, cultural, and socio-economic aspects;

WHEREAS, the creation of an Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) will ensure a comprehensive study and a thorough examination of the impacts to the political, economic, cultural, and social aspects to both the Province of Sulu and the BARMM, taking into consideration the best interests of the residents of both.

WHEREAS, the IATF shall as much as possible, be composed of the heads of ministries, offices, and agencies that have oversight functions, those that are greatly affected by the decision of the Supreme Court, and other concerned bodies, such as, but not limited to the following:
