**RESOLUTION**

**CALLING ON THE MINISTRY OF BASIC, HIGHER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION - TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT (MBHTE-TESD) TO INCLUDE A CAPACITY TRAINING COURSE ON MEDIATION AND CONCILIATION IN ITS PROGRAMS**

**WHEREAS**, the Barangay Justice system is a system of justice administered at the barangay level for the purpose of amicably settling disputes through mediation, conciliation, or arbitration among the family or barangay without resorting to court proceedings;

**WHEREAS**, the fast-evolving demand for access to justice necessitates the need to utilize the Barangay Justice System more strategically and proactively to promote peace at the grassroots levels between and among disputing parties without going to courts thereby economizing the parties from the expenses in court litigation, maintaining peace in the neighborhood and decongesting courts’ dockets;

**WHEREAS**, the Barangay Justice System has been considered an effective mechanism to substantially reduce the number of court litigation and prevent the deterioration of the quality of justice which has been brought about by the indiscriminate filing of cases in the courts;

**WHEREAS**, since mediation and conciliation do not have any predefined procedure or any necessary requirements but is a flexible process, it is an essential factor to professionalize the system and guarantee a sustained high quality training of the barangay justice system implementors such as the mediators and conciliators, in order to improve their strategies to resolve disputes, as well as their pacifying and placatory skills thereby increasing the satisfaction with service quality and the delivery of justice at the barangay level;

**WHEREAS**, substantial knowledge and background of the law and the Barangay Justice System, as well as the skills in dispute mediation and settlement procedures are perceived as key training issues to attain qualified lupon members of the barangay justice system;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Organic Law highlighted in its provision the principles of conciliation and mediation in settling disputes, and for the Bangsamoro Parliament to enact the necessary legislation to institute the mechanism for alternative dispute resolution, which the Shariah courts and traditional or tribal adjudicatory tribunals may utilize in the settlement and resolution of cases;

**WHEREAS**, local conflicts and land disputes hinder peace and development in the Bangsamoro region. They are recognized as complex and sensitive social issues that involve and affect many aspects of society and individuals, which, if not resolved at the earliest possible opportunity, may deter peace and economic progress in the Region;

**WHEREAS**, Rido, a term that originated in Lanao del Sur, describes a family engaging in a violent conflict with another family, and occurs in various parts of the Bangsamoro Region at a considerable number, if not settled at the soonest possible time, may result in intergenerational strife thereby making a hindrance to community peace and development, and poses a threat to the well-being of many;

**WHEREAS**, Republic Act No. 7796 otherwise known as the "Technical Education and Skills Development Act of 1994" aims to encourage the full participation of and mobilize the industry, labor, local government units and technical-vocational institutions in the skills' development of the country's human resources. It pursues the assessment and certification of the competencies of middle-level skilled workers through the Philippine TVET Competency Assessment and Certification System (PTCACS);

**WHEREAS**, under the said act, the assessment process seeks to determine whether the graduate or worker can perform within the standards expected in the workplace based on the defined competency standards. To ensure productivity, quality and global competitiveness of the workers, certification is provided to those who meet the competency standards;

**WHEREAS**, Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 18 otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Education Code of 2021 provides that “The Technical Education and Skills Development shall instill in the Bangsamoro People technical knowledge, skills and attitudes to enable them to become active and productive members of society and to meet and match industry demand with competent and globally competitive workforce”;

**WHEREAS**, there is a need to include in the Program of the Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education-Technical Education and Skills Development the course on mediation and conciliation skills to capacitate more mediators and conciliators in the Region in support of the implementation of the Barangay Justice System in the Region and other alternative dispute resolution mechanisms;

**WHEREAS**, there are 2,490 barangays in the Bangsamoro Region which are in need of approximately 49, 800 well-trained and capacitated lupon members to help achieve the end goal of the Barangay Justice System Law;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the Bangsamoro Parliament TO CALL ON THE MBHTE-TESD TO INCLUDE A CAPACITY TRAINING COURSE ON MEDIATION AND CONCILIATION IN ITS PROGRAM;

**RESOLVED, FINALLY**, that copies of this resolution be furnished to the Ministry of Basic Higher and Technical Education-Technical Education and Skills Development for information and appropriate consideration.
