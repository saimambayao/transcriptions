**RESOLUTION**

**CALLING ON THE MINISTRY OF BASIC, HIGHER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION (MBHTE), THE MINISTRY OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT (MSSD), AND THE MINISTRY OF PUBLIC WORKS (MPW) TO CONDUCT AN ANNUAL SAFETY & SANITARY INSPECTION, EVALUATION, AND REGULAR MONITORING OF EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES OF MADRASAH AND TAHFIDZ AL-QURAN SCHOOLS WITHIN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO BARMM**

**WHEREAS**, Section 18, Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), expressly empowers the Bangsamoro Government to establish, maintain, and supervise *Madaris* education in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS**, under the same provision, the Parliament shall enact legislation to develop and strengthen the *Madaris* educational system in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS**, Section 14, Article IX of the BOL states that the Bangsamoro Government shall respect, protect, and promote the rights of children, especially orphans of tender age. They shall be protected from exploitation, abuse, or discrimination, and their education and development, both physical and mental, shall be fully addressed. Bangsamoro policies and programs shall take into utmost consideration the best interest of children and promote and protect the rights of children, youth, and adolescents, including their survival and development;

**WHEREAS**, a *Madrasah* and *Tahfidz Al-Quran Schools* provide young Muslims with a religious foundation in Qur'anic recitation and Islamic values. For some Muslim children, the *Madrasah* is the only source of formal education that is available; for others, it is supplementary to secular basic education provided in primary and secondary schools;

**WHEREAS**, in the Philippines, the *Madrasah* is the oldest educational institution in Mindanao and is recognized to be one of the most critical factors in the preservation of the Islamic faith and culture;

**WHEREAS**, a Letter of Instruction (LOI) No. 1221 issued by then President Marcos directed the Minister of Education, Culture, and Sports to formulate and adopt a program for the development of the *Madrasah* schools, at least for the improvement of their teaching staff and instructional facilities;

**WHEREAS**, there are Sixty-four (64) Standard Madrasa Curriculum (SMC) Implementers in the BARMM whose educational facilities have to be regularly monitored, inspected, and evaluated for safety and sanitation compliance to ensure that the learners are studying in an environment conducive to learning and their boarding houses or sleeping quarters are clean, safe, properly ventilated and well lighted.

**WHEREAS**, there are other Madaris institutions and *Tahfidz Al-Quran Schools* in the BARMM without proper and adequate education facilities and living quarters for students;

**WHEREAS**, under DepEd's 2010 Educational Facilities Manual, Educational Facilities includes (1) a perimeter fence along the boundaries of the school site with secured entrance and exit gates; (2) school buildings; (3) classrooms; (4) desks/armchairs and other classroom furniture; and, (5) instructional tools/equipment and supplies such as computers, books, magazines, periodicals, journals, bulletins, and other publications;

**WHEREAS**, a Mudir (headmaster) of *Tahfidz Al-Quran Schools* in Cotabato City revealed that students aged (7) years old and above who live in the school’s premises are the ones cooking for themselves and mostly do the labor in maintaining the school's facilities, which could be characterized as child labor under existing national and international laws;

**WHEREAS**, poor conditions of *Madrasah* and of *Tahfidz Al-Quran Schools* facilities impact both teaching and learning outcomes;

**WHEREAS**, it is deemed necessary to regularly monitor the conditions of the Madrasah and Tahfidz Al-Qur'an facilities to ensure the safety and comfort of the students living in these institutions;

**NOW, THEREFORE**, be it **RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved, by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to call on the MBHTE, the MSSD, and the MPW to conduct an annual safety & sanitary inspection, evaluation, and regular monitoring of educational facilities of Madrasah and Tahfidz Al-Quran schools within the Bangsamoro;

**RESOLVED FINALLY**, that copies of this resolution be furnished to the MBHTE, MSSD, and MPW for information and appropriate consideration.
