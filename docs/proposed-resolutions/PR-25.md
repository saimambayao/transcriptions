**A RESOLUTION**
**DIRECTING THE LAND TRANSPORTATION OFFICE - BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (LTO-BARMM) TO CONDUCT A MASSIVE INFORMATION, EDUCATION, AND COMMUNICATION (IEC) CAMPAIGN ON TRAFFIC RULES AND REGULATIONS AMONG TWO-WHEELED MOTOR VEHICLE USERS, IN ORDER TO LESSEN, IF NOT TOTALLY AVOID, ACCIDENTS IN THE REGION**

**WHEREAS,** the Land Transportation Office (LTO) is the front-line agency responsible for efficient public service for a progressive land transport sector¹;

**WHEREAS,** by virtue of E.O. 125 and 125A, dated April 13, 1987 and E.O. 226, dated July 25, 1987, the LTO, a sectoral agency of the Department of Transportation (DOTr), is tasked to register motor vehicles, issue driver's/conductor's licenses and permits, **enforce transportation laws, rules and regulations,** and adjudicate apprehension cases²;

**WHEREAS,** the previous administration of the Department of Transportation (DOTr) fully supported the implementation of the Bangsamoro Organic Law through the turnover of assets and offices located in the BARMM, including those under the LTO;

**WHEREAS,** according to the World Health Organization (WHO), more or less 1.3 million people die each year due to road traffic accidents. Moreover, 20 to 50 million more people are injured, with some acquiring disability³;

**WHEREAS,** in a paper published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), it was stated that according to the LTO in 2017, motorcycle accidents were continuously increasing in number and the death rate toll in the Philippines has become progressively high. Moreover, in the same paper, it was stated that based on records from WHO Philippines, there were a total of 11,264 deaths from accidents on Philippine roads. 5,970 or 53% of that number were drivers or passengers of motorcycles⁴;

**WHEREAS,** in 2019, according to the LTO, motorcycle accidents were the ninth leading cause of death among Filipinos. Moreover, in 2019, there were seven (7) million registered motorcycles in the country, which is three (3) million more than cars and other vehicles combined⁵;

**WHEREAS,** in the BARMM, several accidents involving motorcycles happen on a day-to-day basis, with very harsh fatalities. For instance, in February of 2020, two persons, one of them being a high school student, died, while another person was injured in a head-on collision involving two motorcycles along the section of the national highway in Datu Odin Sinsuat, Maguindanao.⁶ In June of 2020, the Marawi City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (CDRRMO) responded to “another” motorcycle accident which happened along the Mindanao State University Road. The victim was a 17-year-old.⁷ In addition, just recently, in May of 2022, a motorbike crashed into a bus traversing the national highway in Buluan, Maguindanao, killing an elderly couple in their 70s⁸;

**WHEREAS,** some parts of the BARMM prohibit the use of motorcycle helmets for security reasons, making motorcycle drivers more vulnerable to accidents;

**WHEREAS,** some motorcycle drivers take on more than one “back-rider,” the passenger seated behind the motorcycle driver. According to LTO Administrative Order No. AHS-2008-013, only one back-rider is allowed. Taking on more than one back-rider poses a bigger risk to all of the passengers of the motorcycle. For instance, in Basilan, seven (7) people were injured in a head-on collision between a military truck and a motorcycle. The motorcycle was carrying the seven passengers along the Isabela-Lamitan highway in the Basilan province. The two vehicles were traveling from opposite directions and collided after the motorcycle encroached on the lane being traversed by the military truck⁹;

**WHEREAS,** a massive information, education, and communication campaign as regards rules and regulations involving two-wheeled motor vehicles should be conducted by the LTO in order to inform and/or refresh the motorcycle drivers’ knowledge of the existence of such rules and regulations, in order to reduce, if not totally avoid, the likelihood of motorcycle accidents;

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED,** by the BTA Parliament, to pass and approve this resolution directing the LTO-BARMM to conduct a massive IEC campaign on traffic rules and regulations among two-wheeled motor vehicle users, in order to lessen, if not totally avoid, accidents in the autonomous region;

**BE IT RESOLVED FURTHER,** that a copy of this resolution be furnished to the LTO-BARMM for ready reference.
