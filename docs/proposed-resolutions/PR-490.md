**WHEREAS,** on December 15, 2023, President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. issued Proclamation No. 427 declaring Hadja Sakinur Mugong Delasas as one of the nine Filipino artists as “Manlilikha ng Bayan for 2023” for her commitment to safeguard and promote the Sama Igal (dance) tradition;

**WHEREAS,** the Bangsamoro Parliament extend warm congratulations to Hadja Sakinur-ain Delasas for this prestigious award. Through her combined effort and excellence in the Igal, it brought worldwide recognition to the traditional dance, specifically in Southeast Asia, where the dance somehow points to a shared regional heritage;

**WHEREAS,** the Igal is a fast but gentle dance that is shared by the Sama people, rooted in the form of worship performed with the body. It expresses the ecstasy that accompanies the tauhid, that is, the manifestation of a divine being;

**WHEREAS,** the Igal dance is an important element that expresses the cultural identity of the Sama people, and it has inspired modern dance and contemporary art creations in the Philippines.

**WHEREAS,** the participation of the Sama master in her invaluable efforts towards the preservation of the Igal is continuously manifested through her welcoming demeanor to those who want to learn, having once served as the director of the Tambuli Cultural Dance Troupe, in addition to having numerous students in and out of the Province of Tawi-Tawi;

**WHEREAS,** the Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan or the National Living Treasures Award is a program which helps ensure the transfer of intangible cultural skills and heritage to others, and undertakes to promote a genuine appreciation of and instill pride among the people about the national living treasure;

**WHEREAS,** Republic Act No. 7355 provides for the recognition of “National Living Treasures”, otherwise known as the “Manlilikha ng Bayan.” “Manlilikha ng Bayan” refers to a citizen engaged in any traditional art uniquely Filipino whose distinctive skills have reached such a high level of technical and artistic excellence and have been passed on to and widely practiced by the present generation in his/her community with the same degree of technical and artistic competence.

**WHEREAS,** the award does not only recognize Hadja Sakinur-ain Delasas’s role as a steward of the Sama tribe’s intangible cultural heritage but will also aid her community and her apprentice in making sure that the art form will be passed from generation to generation;

**WHEREAS,** these awards, grants, and recognitions are proper not only to honor Delasas and similar individuals who contribute and enrich the Filipino cultural identity and history, but also to preserve and to further promote traditional folk arts for the benefit of future generations;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, to honor Hadja Sakinur-aid Mugong Delasas as one of the recipients of the 2023 Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan as a Sama master of traditional dance for her distinctive mastery and commitment to safeguarding and promoting the Sama Igal (dance) tradition, commending her extraordinary contributions to the Bangsamoro culture and arts.

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED,** that the Bangsamoro Parliament recognizes the pivotal role of the Hadja Sakinur-ain Mugong Delasas in the preservation and promotion of the cultural heritage of the Sama people, highlighting the Igal dance as a unique and shared legacy among various communities;

**BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED,** that copies of this resolution be furnished to the National Commission for Culture and the Arts and the Bangsamoro Commission for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage.
