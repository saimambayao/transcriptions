**A RESOLUTION URGING THE BANGSAMORO PARLIAMENT, THROUGH THE APPROPRIATE COMMITTEE, TO CONDUCT AN INQUIRY, IN AID OF LEGISLATION, INTO THE CURRENT STATE OF HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) INFECTIONS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM), WITH THE END VIEW OF STRENGTHENING POLICIES AND PROGRAMS FOR PREVENTION, TREATMENT, AND AWARENESS**

**WHEREAS,** Section 22, Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law, mandates the Bangsamoro Government to uphold the fundamental right to life by ensuring access to excellent and affordable medical services, protecting and promoting the right to health of the people, and guaranteeing access to essential healthcare and social services that enhance their well-being¹;

**WHEREAS,** recent reports from the Department of Health (DOH) and its Epidemiology Bureau indicate a continuous increase in HIV cases nationwide, with projections estimating that by 2030, the number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in the Philippines may rise to 330,000³;

**WHEREAS,** data from the National HIV/AIDS & STI Surveillance and the DOH-Epidemiology Bureau reveal that the highest infection rates occur among individuals aged 15 to 24, with sexual transmission being the primary mode of infection, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM)⁴;

**WHEREAS,** in the Bangsamoro region, despite efforts to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS, cases continue to rise due to factors such as limited awareness, stigma, cultural sensitivities, and lack of accessible testing and treatment facilities;

**WHEREAS,** as of the latest reports, there have been **83 newly documented HIV/AIDS cases** in BARMM, with **39 cases in Cotabato City** and **44 cases spread across the region**—of these, **71 cases involve MSM**, seven involve heterosexual males, and four involve women, reflecting the urgent need for targeted intervention;

**WHEREAS,** HIV/AIDS is not only a public health concern but also a socio-economic and cultural issue that affects the productivity, education, and overall well-being of communities, necessitating a comprehensive and multi-sectoral approach to prevention, treatment, and stigma reduction⁵;

**WHEREAS,** it is imperative that the Bangsamoro Government, through the Ministry of Health (MOH), in collaboration with relevant agencies, civil society organizations, religious and youth sectors, and community leaders, strengthen HIV/AIDS policies and programs to improve prevention efforts, expand treatment services, and enhance awareness campaigns to address misconceptions and discrimination associated with the disease;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT**

**RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Parliament, to urge the appropriate committee to conduct an inquiry, in aid of legislation, into the current state of HIV infections in BARMM, with the objective of assessing the effectiveness of existing legal frameworks, identifying gaps in service delivery, and formulating evidence-based policies and programs aimed at addressing the rising cases of HIV/AIDS in the region;

**RESOLVED, FURTHER,** that the Bangsamoro Government strengthen its collaboration with national agencies, healthcare providers, non-governmental organizations, and key stakeholders to ensure a culturally sensitive, non-discriminatory, and community-centered approach to HIV/AIDS response;

**RESOLVED, FINALLY,** that copies of this resolution be furnished to the Office of the Chief Minister, the Ministry of Health (MOH), the Department of Health (DOH), local government units (LGUs), the Philippine National AIDS Council, civil society organizations, and other relevant agencies for their information and appropriate action.
