**WHEREAS**, Section 16, Article II of the 1987 Philippine Constitution states that the State shall protect and advance the right of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology in accord with the rhythm and harmony of nature;

**WHEREAS**, Section 11, Article XIII of the Constitution states that the State shall adopt an integrated and comprehensive approach to health development which shall endeavor to make essential goods, health and other social services available to all the people at affordable cost;

**WHEREAS**, Section 3, Article V of R.A. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law states that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants;

**WHEREAS**, in order to actualize the mandate of the said constitutional provisions, Republic Act No. 9003 or otherwise known as “Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000” was passed;

**WHEREAS**, the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000 was signed into law on January 26, 2001. The said law was enacted to adopt a systematic, comprehensive, and ecological solid waste management program which aimed to ensure the protection of public health and environment;

**WHEREAS**, the same law strictly prohibits the manufacturing or use of non-environmentally acceptable materials, and requires biodegradable and environment-friendly materials for packaging as part of the Solid Waste Management Program;

**WHEREAS**, despite the passage of this law, garbage production alongside its environmentally harmful materials still continues to increase at an alarming rate;

**WHEREAS**, plastic bags are extensively used throughout the Bangsamoro region. The majority of the stores and restaurants in the region still generally wrap their products in plastic, Styrofoam and other non-biodegradable materials;

**WHEREAS**, the use of these non-biodegradable materials can inflict direct damage to the environment, specifically the communities in the region. These materials take decades to decompose and can simultaneously cause the clogging of waterways, drainages, and other bodies of water;

**WHEREAS**, Section 37, Article 6 of the same law prohibits the use of open dumps for solid wastes;

**WHEREAS**, Cotabato City still uses the Biniruan dumpsite for its waste disposal for 18 years despite being banned in 2000 by virtue of R.A. 9003¹;

**WHEREAS**, Section 10 of the same law specifies that the Local Government Units (LGUs) shall be primarily responsible for the implementation and enforcement of the provisions of the said law within their respective jurisdictions;

**WHEREAS**, the Ministry of Interior and Local Government (MILG) is the lead ministry and primary overseer over all LGUs in the region;

**WHEREAS**, the protection of our environment requires efficient measures in the management of solid wastes, so that they do not become pollutants in the seas, rivers, lakes and other bodies of water, and also in the air in the case that they are burned;

**WHEREAS**, despite the substantial penalties imposed on those who violate the provisions of the said law, there are still continued cases of gross violations, including the burning of solid waste, and the dumping of garbage and waste in canals in some parts of the region;

**WHEREAS**, failure in the implementation of the said law can pose a significant threat to public health and the environment. Both of which can cause health and sanitation problems, and can even exacerbate climate change;

**WHEREAS**, in order to achieve a balanced and healthful ecology within the Bangsamoro Region, the Bangsamoro Government must sternly and thoughtfully address the region’s waste predicament brought about by the rapid increase of population; and

**WHEREAS**, it is an immediate concern of the Bangsamoro Government to review and assess the compliance of the Bangsamoro Region in the implementation of R.A 9003 in order to aid policy measures on solid waste management.

**NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the BTA Parliament, to pass and approve this Resolution Urging the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources and Energy (MENRE) in close coordination with the Ministry of Interior and Local Government (MILG) to assess and review the implementation Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000 specifically on Article 6 – Waste Management Facilities and Article 7 - Local Government Solid Waste Management, of all Local Government Units in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, in order to aid policy measures on solid waste management.

**RESOLVED FINALLY**, that copy of this Resolution be furnished to the MENRE and MILG for information and appropriate action.

Adopted,
