**WHEREAS**, the transfer authorizes the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) BARMM to take over the landside management of the said airports, including the operation and management of the airport’s passenger terminal building, administrative building, and vehicle parking area;

**WHEREAS**, airport announcements are indispensable services to assist airline passengers and other airport users;

**WHEREAS**, the use of local language, in addition to English and Filipino, in airport announcements can facilitate communication, understanding, and improve airport services and operations.

**RESOLVED**, by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament, as it is hereby resolved, to urge the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) to require airport announcements in the region to be made in the major local languages in the Bangsamoro, in addition to English and Filipino.
