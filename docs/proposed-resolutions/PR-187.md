**RESOLUTION**

**URGING ALL CONCERNED MINISTRIES, AGENCIES, OFFICES, LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNITS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTALITIES OF THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE SWIFT AND FULL COMPLIANCE WITH REPUBLIC ACT NO. 11861 OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE “EXPANDED SOLO PARENTS WELFARE ACT”**

**WHEREAS**, passed into law on June 4, 2022, Republic Act No. 11861 or the Expanded Solo Parents Welfare Act which amended Republic Act No. 8972 or the Solo Parents’ Welfare Act of 2000 bears upon the policy of the state to promote a just and dynamic social order that will ensure the prosperity and independence of the nation and free the people from poverty through policies that provide adequate social services, promote full employment, a rising standard of living, and an improved quality of life for all;

**WHEREAS**, RA 11861 seeks to uplift the lives of many Filipino solo parents and ensures that they will receive adequate social protection programs from the government;

**WHEREAS**, the revised implementing rules and regulations (RIRR) of RA 11861 which provides for the criteria, qualification, and categorization of solo parents to the expanded social benefits provided by said law was promulgated by the Department of Social Welfare and Development in coordination with other concerned agencies on October 3, 2022;

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Government recognizes the heavy responsibilities of Bangsamoro solo parents who serve both as the “ilaw at haligi ng tahanan” and shall ensure their welfare consistent with its policy to promote social justice in all aspects of life and phases of development in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region;

**WHEREAS**, it is important to stress the swift and full implementation of R.A. 11861 in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region especially in view of over two (2) decades long history of poor or faulty implementation of the Solo Parents Welfare Act of 2000;

**WHEREAS**, the swift and full implementation of R.A. 11861 is necessary to address the pressing needs of solo parents during this time of economic hardship;

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED** by the BTA Parliament, as it hereby resolves, to urge all BARMM Ministries, Agencies, Offices, Local Government Units and other instrumentalities responsible for the implementation of the Expanded Solo Parents Welfare Act in the regional and city/municipal levels to ensure their swift and full implementation and due observance.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, to send a copy of this Resolution to all concerned Ministries, Agencies, Offices, LGUs and other instrumentalities of the Bangsamoro government.
