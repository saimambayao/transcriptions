**RESOLUTION**

**CALLING ON THE CONSTITUENT BARANGAY LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNITS TO CONSIDER ALLOCATING A MINIMUM OF .5% OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATIONAL TAX ALLOTMENT (NTA) FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BARANGAY JUSTICE SYSTEM**

**WHEREAS**, in accordance with the Local Government Code of 1991 (Republic Act 7160), the Barangay Justice System is an extra-governmental mechanism aimed at perpetuating the time-honored tradition of amicably settling interpersonal disputes in a community, to achieve peace and harmony and likewise to be an accessible and effective form of achieving justice without resorting to adversarial proceedings in court;

**WHEREAS**, the crucial role of the Lupon members in local disputes is highly emphasized in the mediation and conciliation process. The significance of their work is demonstrated especially in ensuring that the objectives and purposes for which the Barangay Justice System has been enacted are implemented effectively and efficiently on the community or barangay level;

**WHEREAS**, barangay workers, including the Lupon members are not covered by the rules of the Civil Service and are not entitled to the same benefits as regular government employees;

**WHEREAS**, RA 7160 otherwise known as the local government code of the Philippines does not provide allocation to ensure the well-being and security of the Lupon members as volunteers to help implement justice at the community or barangay level;

**WHEREAS**, security and safety concerns are inherent in the performance of the duties and function of the officials implementing the Katarungang Pambarangay Law considering that they are in the front lines in resolving various disputes that fall in their jurisdiction.

**WHEREAS**, the barangay justice system implementors are also community members whose welfare and needs must be taken into account considering their significant contributions to maintaining peace and harmony in their communities;

**WHEREAS**, common practice dictates that the grant of allowances or incentives to workers increases efficiency and effectiveness in performing their respective functions.

**WHEREAS**, the Lupon members, with their contribution in decongesting court dockets and helping administer justice at the local level, should be acknowledged by providing them a definite allocation in the National Tax Allotment (NTA).

**WHEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED**, by the Bangsamoro Parliament to call on the constituent Barangay Local Government Units to consider allocating a minimum of .5% of their respective National Tax Allotment (NTA) for the Implementation of the Barangay Justice System;

**RESOLVED, FINALLY**, that copies of this resolution be furnished to the Ministry of Interior and Local Government and other concerned agencies or ministries for information and appropriate consideration.
