**A RESOLUTION DIRECTING THE POLICY RESEARCH AND LEGAL SERVICES (PRLS) OF THE BANGSAMORO PARLIAMENT TO CONDUCT A DETAILED AND OBJECTIVE STUDY ON THE EDUCATION SYSTEM IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM), WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON MADARIS EDUCATION AND ITS ROLE IN SHAPING OVERALL EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES, TO INFORM FUTURE LEGISLATION**

**WHEREAS**, Section 2, Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), mandates the Bangsamoro Government to ensure access to quality education and to take appropriate steps to make education available to all, especially the poor and marginalized;¹

**WHEREAS**, Section 10, Article IV of the BOL provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall give the highest priority to education, health, and social services, particularly for the underprivileged, vulnerable, and disadvantaged sectors;

**WHEREAS**, Section 16, Article IX of the BOL mandates the Bangsamoro Government to establish, maintain, and support a complete, adequate, and integrated system of quality education, recognizing the complementary roles of public and private educational institutions, including Madaris and indigenous learning systems;

**WHEREAS**, Section 17, Article IX of the BOL specifically mandates the institutionalization of Madaris educational systems within the Bangsamoro educational framework, consistent with national standards and Islamic beliefs and cultural heritage;

**WHEREAS**, Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 18, or the Bangsamoro Education Code, affirms the Bangsamoro Government’s commitment to an inclusive, culture-sensitive, Islam-informed, and rights-based education system that integrates Madaris education, indigenous peoples’ education, and technical-vocational training;²

**WHEREAS**, Section 6 of the Bangsamoro Education Code establishes the Bangsamoro Education System as one that is inclusive and relevant, and explicitly includes the integration of Madaris education;

**WHEREAS**, Section 49 of the Bangsamoro Education Code recognizes **Madaris Education** as a major component of the regional education system that nurtures learners in accordance with Islamic values while also equipping them with life and work skills;

**WHEREAS**, Section 104 of the same Code provides for the professionalization of Madaris educators, including the creation of a special eligibility for Mudarris (Islamic teachers), thereby formalizing their role within the region’s broader educational framework;

**WHEREAS**, for School Year 2023–2024, BARMM recorded a total enrollment of **1,258,253 learners**, of which **55,172** were in Madaris, indicating the sector’s growing role in providing access to education;³

**WHEREAS**, BARMM is home to more than **1,700 Madaris**—both formal and non-formal—serving **over 84,000 learners**, with a 2024–2026 strategic plan now being rolled out to address curriculum quality, teacher development, and infrastructure gaps;⁴⁵

**WHEREAS**, the Bangsamoro Government has begun allocating substantial investments in Madaris education, including Php **93.15 million** in subsidies to support Standard Madrasah Curriculum (SMC) implementers, benefitting **18,630 learners**;⁶

**WHEREAS**, the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education (MBHTE) continues to receive the largest share of the regional budget—**₱32.14 billion** in 2025, which accounts for 33.2% of the **₱94.41 billion** Bangsamoro Expenditure Program—reflecting the Bangsamoro Government’s prioritization of the education sector in both operational and infrastructure investments;⁷

**WHEREAS**, despite these efforts, BARMM faces persistent educational challenges, such as a low cohort survival rate (only 17 of 100 Grade 1 students graduated Grade 12), low participation rates (only 13% in senior high school), and limited access to quality education, especially in underserved areas;⁸

**WHEREAS**, the newly launched Bangsamoro Madrasah Education Strategic Plan (2024–2026) and the establishment of BARMM’s first public Madrasah in Cotabato City mark critical milestones that must be assessed for impact and sustainability;⁹

**WHEREAS**, these indicators underscore the need for an evidence-based, region-specific evaluation of BARMM’s education system—especially the Madaris sector—to identify policy gaps, inform reforms, and guide legislative action;

**WHEREAS**, the Policy Research and Legal Services (PRLS) of the Bangsamoro Parliament is mandated to provide research-based policy and legal support to legislative initiatives, including studies in aid of legislation;

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved, to **direct** the Policy Research and Legal Services (PRLS) of the Bangsamoro Parliament to conduct a detailed and objective study on the education system in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), with **particular focus on the role of Madaris education** and its role in shaping overall education outcomes;

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, that the study shall include, but not be limited to, the following key areas:

a) Enrollment trends, cohort survival, and learning outcomes across formal, Madaris, and ALS streams;¹⁰

b) Classification, geographic distribution, and accreditation of Madaris;

c) Curriculum integration and compliance with national and Islamic education standards;

e) Infrastructure status, learning environment, and access to instructional materials;

f) Funding, subsidies, and support mechanisms for public and private Madaris;

g) Community perceptions and socio-cultural roles of Madaris;

h) Barriers to access, retention, and educational equity;

**RESOLVED FINALLY**, that the results of this study, together with policy and legislative recommendations, be submitted to the Bangsamoro Parliament not later than the 30th day of September, 2025, to support the formulation of responsive and evidence-based legislation that will strengthen the educational foundations of the Bangsamoro people.
