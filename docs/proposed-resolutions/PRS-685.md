**WHEREAS**, food and nutritional care in hospitals are vital components of patient-centered care, and these include the capability to address the evolving nutritional requirements of patients, which also differ based on their health status¹;

**WHEREAS**, a study has shown that patients with malnutrition and poor food intake are associated with longer stays in the hospital, frequent readmissions, and greater in-hospital mortality²;

**WHEREAS**, in the Philippines alone, the prevalence of malnutrition among hospitalized patients is between 48% to 53%, and it is concluded that every hospital in the country has malnourished patients³;

**WHEREAS**, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) developed the Nutrition Care Process (NCP) to improve the consistency and quality of individualized care for patients and the predictability of patient outcomes, intending to standardize a process for providing nutrition care.

**WHEREAS**, in 2016, Republic Act No. 10862, or the Nutrition and Dietetics Law of 2016, was enacted to regulate the practice of nutrition and dietetics in the Philippines, and the same law provided that practitioners of nutrition and dietetics should render medical nutrition therapy through the application of the Nutrition Care Process for disease prevention, treatment, and management.

**WHEREAS**, in August 2019, the Department of Health released Administrative Order No. 2019-0033, creating guidelines for implementing the NCP in both public and private hospitals.

**WHEREAS**, the same administrative order was intended to provide the mandate and direction for public and private hospitals to operationalize and institutionalize NCP in their respective facilities.

**WHEREAS**, based on a study assessing the implementation of NCP in the country, while the participants demonstrated a high level of knowledge of NCP, there remain various barriers to its successful implementation, including insufficient resources, lack of training, and administrative constraints⁴.

**WHEREAS**, the abovementioned study posits the need for further support from institutions and policy-makers to remove the said barriers and promote the institutionalization of NCP laws and policies.

**WHEREAS**, Filipino health and nutrition experts have also highlighted the limitations in the implementation of NCP, including limited management support, resource constraints, and training deficiencies⁵.

**NOW, THEREFORE, be it**

**RESOLVED**, by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, as it hereby resolved, to request the Ministry of Health to apprise the parliament of the latest progress on the implementation of the nutrition care process in public and private hospitals, pursuant to the Department of Health's administrative order no. 2019-0033;

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, that the Bangsamoro Transition Authority calls upon the Ministry of Health to highlight in its report, if there are any, the identified barriers in the implementation of the nutrition care process.

**ADOPTED**,
