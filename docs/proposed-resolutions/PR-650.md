**A RESOLUTION REQUESTING THE NATIONAL AMNESTY COMMISSION TO EXPEDITE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GRANTING OF AMNESTY TO THE OFFICIALS AND MEMBERS OF THE MORO ISLAMIC LIBERATION FRONT (MILF) AND MORO NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (MNLF)**

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Parliament acknowledges the peace agreements signed between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GPH) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) as significant steps toward long-lasting peace and stability in the Bangsamoro region;

WHEREAS, the granting of amnesty to MILF and MNLF officials and members is a vital provision of these agreements, aimed at fostering reconciliation, social integration, and the full transition to peaceful and productive civilian life for those formerly engaged in armed struggle;

WHEREAS, the 2025 midterm elections are fast approaching, and several MILF members who are seeking public office are facing arrest and legal impediments due to pending cases, despite their demonstrated commitment to the peace process and political participation;

WHEREAS, the recent arrests and serving of warrants of arrest against MILF members who are aspiring candidates for the 2025 elections not only hinder their political participation but also pose a threat to the stability and peacebuilding efforts in the Bangsamoro region;

WHEREAS, many of the affected MILF and MNLF officials and members have expressed their intent to engage in lawful business ventures, pursue other economic activities, and participate in religious observances such as Hajj and ‘Umrah, all of which contribute to their reintegration into mainstream society and economic development;

WHEREAS, the Bangsamoro Parliament believes that the prompt implementation of amnesty is consistent with the letter and spirit of the peace agreements signed between the GPH and the MILF and MNLF, and will further solidify the gains of the peace process;

**NOW, THEREFORE,** be it resolved, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Parliament in session assembled:

**1.** To strongly request the National Amnesty Commission to expedite the processing and implementation of the granting of amnesty to MILF and MNLF officials and members, particularly those with pending cases and who are participating as candidates in the 2025 midterm elections;

**2.** To urge the National Government to support the efforts of the National Amnesty Commission in ensuring the swift and comprehensive delivery of amnesty, consistent with the peace agreements and the commitments made to the MILF and MNLF;

**3.** To encourage the Office of the Chief Minister and relevant agencies of the Bangsamoro Government to collaborate with the National Amnesty Commission via the National Government—Bangsamoro Government Intergovernmental Relations Body (IGRB) in facilitating the necessary documentation, coordination, and support for the expeditious granting of amnesty;

**4.** To call on all sectors of society, including the business community, religious organizations, and civil society groups, to support the reintegration efforts of MILF and MNLF members and to contribute to the holistic development and peacebuilding initiatives in the Bangsamoro region.

**RESOLVED FURTHER,** that a copy of this Resolution be furnished to the Office of the President of the Republic of the Philippines, the National Amnesty Commission, the Office of the Chief Minister of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), and all other relevant agencies for their information and appropriate action.
