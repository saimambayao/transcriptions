**A RESOLUTION URGING THE PARLIAMENT AND ALL MINISTRIES, OFFICES AND AGENCIES OF THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENT TO IMMEDIATELY IMPLEMENT AND STRICTLY FOLLOW MEMORANDUM ORDER NO. 285 SERIES OF 2019 ISSUED BY CHIEF MINISTER AHOD B. EBRAHIM BANNING SINGLE-USE OF PLASTICS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM)**

**WHEREAS**, the Philippines is notoriously tagged as one of the top countries with a high incidence of plastic waste and land-based plastic pollution thrown into the ocean.

**WHEREAS**, the Philippines is considered as the largest contributor of plastic waste worldwide, contributing an estimated 0.75 million metric tons of plastic ever year to the ocean.

**WHEREAS**, plastic leaking to the environment can impose severe dangers to the wildlife, particularly marine organisms which ingest and get entangled with various plastic waste found in the ocean - causing external and internal injuries and blockages in their digestive tracts and airways eventually causing their death.

**WHEREAS**, it is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the Bangsamoro people to minimize, if not eradicate the use, sale, and provision of single-use plastics and encourage the utilization of eco-friendly, reusable and biodegradable materials and alternatives.

**WHEREAS**, in direct response to climate change adaptation, the Chief Minister, Ahod B. Ebrahim, issued Memorandum Order No. 285 dated 17 June 2019, calling for the adoption of a “Ban on Single-Use Plastic” policy in all offices of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.

**WHEREAS**, more than three (3) years since the issuance of the said memorandum, it is readily observable that plastics are still proliferating in every nook and corner of the Bangsamoro Government Center (BGC). Despite the issuance of this Memorandum, bottled mineral water, plastic bags, straws, cups, plates, spoons, forks, Styrofoam and plastic containers are consistently utilized and provided during meetings, functions and seminars in the BGC, in open and direct violation of “Ban on Single Use Plastics Policy.

**WHEREAS**, similarly, despite the issuance of Memorandum Order 285 requiring all officials and employees to utilize reusable drinking containers, tumblers, mugs, and/or biodegradable food packs, it is noticeable that compliance among concerned employees is virtually nil.

**WHEREAS**, Memorandum Order 285 requires food concessionaires and caterers serving and providing for the meals/snacks during meetings, functions, and seminars in the BARMM to use containers made of paper, plant-based wrappers or reusable containers. However, it is visible to the naked eye that there is much to be desired in terms of compliance of this policy.

**NOW THEREFORE**, be it **RESOLVED**, as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, that all Parliament Offices, Ministries, Agencies of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao be REMINDED to STRICTLY FOLLOW and IMMEDIATELY IMPLEMENT Memorandum Order No. 285, Series of 2019 as our small sacrifice but great contribution to save and conserve the environment.

**FURTHER RESOLVED**, that all officials and employees be **STRICTLY REQUIRED** to use reusable drinking containers, tumblers, mugs and/or biodegradable food packs.

**FURTHER RESOLVED**, that all food concessionaires/caterers be sternly reminded to immediately **FOLLOW** and **IMPLEMENT** the aforesaid Memorandum enjoining them to place food in containers either made of paper, plant-based wrappers or reusable plastic containers.

**ADOPTED**,

(Sgd.)
**HON. MARY ANN M. ARNADO**
