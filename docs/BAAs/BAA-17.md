Promotion may be from one agency to another or from one organizational unit to another within the same agency. *Provided, however*, That any upward movement from the non-career service to the career service and vice versa shall not be considered as a promotion but as reappointment.

An employee who is promoted to another agency shall notify the head of the agency in writing where he/she is employed at least 30 days prior to his/her assumption to the position. It is understood that the employee who is promoted to another agency is cleared from all money, property, and work-related accountabilities.

The transfer may be from one organizational unit to another in the same agency or from one department or agency to another: *Provided, however*, That any movement from the non-career service to the career service and vice versa shall not be considered as a transfer but reappointment.

An employee who seeks transfer to another office shall notify the head of the agency in writing where he/she is employed at least 30 days prior to the effective date of his/her transfer. The head of the agency shall notify the employee in writing of the approval of the request to transfer within 30 days from date of notice.

If the request to transfer of an employee is not granted by the head of the agency where he/she is employed, it shall be deemed approved after the lapse of 30 days from the date of notice without the need to notify the employee concerned.

It is understood that the employee who seeks to transfer is cleared from all money, property and work-related accountabilities.

If, for whatever reason, the employee fails to transfer on the specified date, he/she shall be deemed resigned. However, should the employee opt to remain in the same agency before the specified date of transfer, the employee may be reappointed if there is no gap in the service or reemployed if there is gap in the service. In both cases, the employee shall undergo the usual hiring process.

**Article 41. Reemployment.** Reemployment is the appointment of a person who has been previously appointed to a position in the government service but was separated therefrom as a result of reduction in force, reorganization, retirement, voluntary resignation, or any non-disciplinary action such as dropping from the rolls and other modes of separation. Reemployment presupposes a gap in the service.

No prior authority from the Commission shall be required for the reemployment of a person who has been previously retired or resigned and who has not reached the compulsory retirement age of 65.

**Article 42. Reappointment.** Reappointment is the issuance of an appointment as a result of reorganization, devolution, salary standardization, re-nationalization, recategorization, rationalization or similar events, including the following:

1. The issuance of appointment from temporary to permanent, career to non-career or vice versa, non-career to another non-career, all of which entails no gap in the service, shall be considered as reappointment. Non-career employees who are appointed for the first time in the career service under permanent status shall be required to undergo probationary period for six (6) months.

2. The renewal of temporary, contractual and casual appointment upon the expiration of the appointment or subsequent appointment of substitute teachers, which entails no gap in the service, shall be considered as reappointment.

Reappointment presupposed no gap in the service.

If the request to transfer of an employee is not granted by the head of the agency where he/she is employed, it shall be deemed approved after the lapse of 30 days from the date of notice without the need to notify the employee concerned.

It is understood that the employee who seeks to transfer is cleared from all money, property and work-related accountabilities.

If, for whatever reason, the employee fails to transfer on the specified date, he/she shall be deemed resigned. However, should the employee opt to remain in the same agency before the specified date of transfer, the employee may be reappointed if there is no gap in the service or reemployed if there is gap in the service. In both cases, the employee shall undergo the usual hiring process.

**Article 43. Reinstatement (to comparable position).** Reinstatement to comparable position is the restoration of a person, as a result of a decision, to a career position from which he/she has, through no delinquency or misconduct, been separated but subject position is already abolished, requiring the issuance of an appointment to a comparable position to the separated employee.

However, reinstatement (to the same position/item), which involves the restoration of a person, as a result of a decision, to a career position from which he/she has, through no delinquency or misconduct, been separated from the service and subject position is still available, does not need the issuance of an appointment.

**Article 44. Demotion.** Demotion is the movement of an employee from a higher position to a lower position where he/she qualifies, if a lower position is available. The demotion entails reduction in duties, responsibilities, status or rank, which may or may not involve a reduction in salary.

In cases where the demotion is due to reorganization or rationalization, the employee shall be allowed to continue to receive the salary of the higher position.

In cases where the demotion is voluntary or at the instance of the employee, he/she shall be allowed to receive the same step of the salary grade of the position where he/she voluntarily sought to be appointed. A written consent shall be secured from the demoted employee.

**Article 45. Reclassification.** Reclassification is a form of staffing modification and/or position classification action which is applied only when there is a substantial change in the regular duties and responsibilities of the position. This may result in a change in any or all of the position attributes: position title, level and/or salary grade. It generally involves a change in the position title and may be accompanied by an upward or downward change in salary. Reclassification is the generic term for changes in staff/position classification which includes upgrading, downgrading, and categorization.

Reclassification of position requires the issuance of an appointment but the same is ministerial on the part of the appointing officer/authority.

The appointment of an incumbent (permanent employee) whose position was reclassified shall be approved/validated, regardless of whether he/she meets the qualification requirements of the position involved. The incumbent of the reclassified position has a vested right to the reclassified position but he/she shall not be promoted unless he/she meets the qualification requirements of the next higher position.

In LGUs, no reclassification shall be allowed except when the position is actually vacant.

**Article 46. Notice of Change or Human Resource Movement.** Adjustments or movements of human resource which do not involve changes in position title, rank or status shall not require the issuance of an appointment. A notice of such change or movement shall be issued to the employee. A copy thereof shall be kept in the employee’s 201 File and another copy shall be submitted to the CSC for BARMM for record purposes.

The adjustments or movements of human resource shall include the following:

a. Change in item number - the adjustment or shifting of item number of a position per agency Plantilla of Personnel.

b. Salary adjustment - the change in salary as a result of increase in pay levels or upgrading of positions which does not involve a change in qualification requirements.

c. Step increment - the increase in salary from step to step within the salary grade allocation of the official or employee's position in recognition of meritorious performance based on a Performance Management System (PMS) approved by the Commission and/or through length of service. A Notice of Step Increment (NOSI) is issued by the heads of agencies for this purpose.

d. Reinstatement (to the same position/item) - the restoration, as a result of a decision, of a person to a career position from which he/she has, through no delinquency or misconduct, been separated therefrom. The employee has a vested right to his/her former item, hence, he/she is deemed not to have left the service and therefore has no gap in the service. He/she shall be entitled to payment of back salaries including allowances and all benefits which would have accrued if he/she has not been separated. A copy of the decision shall be furnished the CSC for BARMM for record purposes.

The appointment of the employee hired to fill the position of an employee with pending appeal of his/her dismissal or separation from the service shall bear a colatilla that his/her appointment is subject to the outcome of the case.

e. Demotion as a result of a disciplinary action - the adjustment of the salary of an employee to the next lower salary grade with the same salary step. A notice of salary adjustment shall be issued.

f. Positions marked as Coterminous with The Incumbent (CTI) as a result of rationalization or reorganization of the agency — A person issued with a permanent appointment whose position is marked as CTI as a result of rationalization or reorganization of his/her agency shall retain his/her permanent status until he/she is appointed/promoted to another position, or resigns or retires from the service. The CTI status of the position shall be reflected in the Plantilla of Personnel of the agency.

In case of promotion or separation from the service through retirement, resignation, transfer, death of the incumbent, the position marked as CTI shall automatically be abolished.

**Chapter III**
**OTHER HUMAN RESOURCE ACTIONS**

**Article 47. Human Resource Actions.** The following human resource actions which will not require the issuance of an appointment shall nevertheless require an Office Order issued by the appointing officer/authority: reassignment, detail and designation.

**Article 48. Reassignment.** Reassignment is the movement of an employee across the organizational structure within the same agency, which does not involve a reduction in rank, status or salary.

Reassignment shall be governed by the following:

1. Reassignment of employees with station-specific place of work indicated in their respective appointments within the geographical location of the agency shall be allowed only for a maximum period of one (1) year. The restoration or return to the original post/assignment shall be automatic without the need of any order of restoration/revocation of the order of reassignment.

The reassigned employee who is restored to his/her original post/assignment pursuant to the decision of the Commission shall not be reassigned within one (1) year reckoned from the date of restoration to the original post/assignment. Otherwise, the appointing officer/authority or the authorized official who caused the subsequent reassignment within one (1) year from the date of restoration may be cited for indirect contempt by the Commission.

An appointment is considered station-specific when: (a) the particular office or station where the position is located is specifically indicated on the face of the appointment paper; or (b) the position title already specifies the station, such as HRMO, Accountant, Budget Officer, Assessor, Social Welfare and Development Officer (SWDO), and such other positions with organizational unit/station-specific function. Such position titles are considered station-specific even if the place of assignment is not indicated on the face of the appointment.

2. If an appointment is not station-specific, the one-year maximum period of reassignment within the geographical location of the agency shall not apply. However, the employee concerned may request for a recall of the reassignment citing his/her reasons why he/she wants to go back to his/her original station. The reassignment may also be revoked or recalled by the appointing officer/authority or be declared not valid by the Commission or a competent court, on appeal.

3. Reassignment is presumed to be regular and made in the interest or exigency of public service unless proven otherwise or if it constitutes constructive dismissal. Constructive dismissal exists when an official or employee quits his/her work because of the agency head’s unreasonable, humiliating, or demeaning actuations, which render continued work impossible because of geographic location, financial dislocation and performance of other duties and responsibilities inconsistent with those attached to the position. Hence, the employee is deemed illegally dismissed. This may occur although there is no diminution or reduction in rank, status or salary of the employee.

Reassignment that constitutes constructive dismissal may be any of the following:

i. Reassignment of an employee to perform duties and responsibilities in consistent with the duties and responsibilities of his/her position such as from a position of dignity to a more servile or menial job;

ii. Reassignment to an office not in the existing organizational structure;

iii. Reassignment to an existing office but the employee is not given any definite set of duties and responsibilities;

iv. Reassignment that will cause significant financial dislocation or will cause difficulty or hardship on the part of the employee because of geographic location; or

v. Reassignment that is done indiscriminately or whimsically because the law is not intended as a convenient shield for the appointing/disciplining officer to harass or oppress a subordinate on the pretext of advancing and promoting public interest such as reassignment of employees twice within a year, or reassignment of career service officials and employees with valid appointments during change of administration of elective and appointive officials.

Reassignment that results in constructive dismissal must be sufficiently established.

4. The employee may appeal the reassignment order within 15 days upon receipt thereof to the Commission or CSC for BARMM as provided under specific law, if he/she believes there is no justification for the reassignment. Pending appeal, the reassignment shall not be executory. The Decision of the CSC for BARMM may be further appealed to the Commission within 15 days from receipt thereof.

5. Reassignment of public health workers, public social workers, public school teachers and all other professions covered by special laws shall be governed by their respective laws. However, the rules herein mentioned shall be applied suppletorily.

**Article 49. Detail.** Detail is the temporary movement of an employee from one agency to another which does not involve a reduction in rank, status or salary.

Detail shall be governed by the following rules:

a. The detailed employee shall receive his/her salary only from his/her parent agency;

b. Detail without consent shall be allowed only for a period of one (1) year;

c. Detail with consent shall be allowed for a maximum of three (3) years, the extension or renewal of the detail shall be discretionary on the part of the parent agency;

d. Detail from one agency to another shall be covered by an agreement manifesting the arrangement between the agency heads that it shall not result in reduction in rank, status or salary of the employee, the duration of the detail, duties to be assigned to the employee and responsibilities of the parent agency and receiving agency;

e. The employee may appeal the detail order within 15 days upon receipt to the Commission or the CSC for BARMM if he/she believes there is no justification for the detail. Pending appeal, the detail order shall be executory unless otherwise ordered by the Commission. The decision of the said CSC for BARMM may be further appealed to the Commission within 15 days from receipt;

f. During the period of the detail, the parent agency relinquishes administrative supervision and control over the detailed employee to the receiving agency. In this regard, the receiving agency has the following responsibilities: to monitor the punctuality and attendance of the employee, approve requests for leave, evaluate the employee’s performance, grant the authority to travel and exercise other acts necessary to effectively supervise the employee; *Provided*, That a report on said matters is submitted to the parent agency for record purposes;

g. The detailed employee shall be designated by the receiving agency to a position whose duties are comparable to his/her position in the parent agency. However, he/she shall not be designated to a position exercising control or supervision over regular and career employees of the receiving agency;

h. Prior to the effectivity of the detail, the parent agency shall furnish a certification of the available sick and vacation leave credits of the detailed employee to the receiving agency. In the event the receiving agency approves requests for leave by the detailed employee, a copy of the same shall be submitted to the parent agency;

i. The authority to discipline the detailed employee is still vested in the appointing officer/authority of the parent agency where he/she belongs. As used herein, the authority to discipline includes the determination of the existence of a *prima facie* case against the detailed employee, issuance of a formal charge, issuance of the order of preventive suspension if the case so warrants, conduct of formal investigation, and rendering of the decision on the administrative case.

With respect to the administrative case arising from acts done by the employee in the receiving agency, said agency shall have the right to initiate or file the complaint against the detailed employee subject to the provisions of the 2017 Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (RACCS); and

j. All human resource actions and movements, including monetization of leave credits, concerning the detailed employee, shall still be under the jurisdiction of the parent agency notwithstanding that the employee is detailed in another agency.

**Article 50. Designation.** Designation is the movement that involves an imposition of additional and/or higher duties to be performed by a public official/employee which is temporary and can be terminated anytime at the pleasure of the appointing officer/authority. Designation may involve the performance of the duties of another position on a concurrent capacity or on full-time basis.

A designation in an acting capacity entails not only the exercise of the ministerial functions attached to the position but also the exercise of discretion since the person designated is deemed to be the incumbent of the position.

Officials designated as Officer-in-Charge (OIC) enjoy limited powers which are confined to functions of administration and ensuring that the office continues its usual activities. The OIC may not be deemed to possess the power to appoint employees as the same involves the exercise of discretion which is beyond the power of an OIC, unless the designation order issued by the proper appointing officer/authority expressly includes the power to issue appointment.

Designation shall be governed by the following rules:

1. Employees to be designated should hold permanent appointments to career positions.

2. Designees can only be designated to positions within the level they are currently occupying. Employees holding first level positions cannot be designated to perform the duties of second level positions except in meritorious cases as determined by the CSC for BARMM upon request for exemption by the agency concerned, such as organizational set-up, calamity, and due to exigency of the service. This exception shall not apply to positions involving supervisory and executive managerial functions. Division Chiefs may be designated to perform the duties of second level executive/managerial positions.

3. For positions with incumbents who temporarily cannot perform the duties of the position (due to vacation or sick leave, study leave scholarship, maternity leave, special assignments), the designation should be synchronized with the absence of the incumbent, unless earlier revoked or recalled by the appointing officer/authority. However, the designation of employees may be renewed every year in the exigency of the service but not to exceed two (2) years.

4. For positions without incumbents, a designation may be made only for a maximum of one (1) year. However, the designation of employees may be renewed every year in the exigency of the service but not to exceed two (2) years.

5. Designations shall be made through an office order issued by the appointing officer/authority concerned.

6. For designation to critical positions in the LGUs such as Provincial/City/Municipal Government Department Head, a copy of the office order shall be furnished by the HRMOs of the LGUs to the CSC for BARMM within 30 days upon its issuance. Employees designated to positions with duties involving practice of profession shall be required to possess the necessary professional license.

7. Designees cannot be granted the salaries of the positions they are being designated to. However, allowances that go with the performance of the functions such as RATA (Representation and Transportation Allowance) or EME (Extraordinary and Miscellaneous Expenses) may be granted as provided under the provisions of the General Appropriations Act for the Bangsamoro (GAAB) or appropriation ordinance of the respective local *sanggunian*; *Provided*,the grant of the same is specifically stated in the designation order.

8. Only experience gained from designation compliant with the above stated rules shall be credited as relevant experience for purposes of appointment.

**Article 51. Probationary Period.** Original appointees in the career service with permanent status of appointment shall undergo a probationary period for six (6) months or depending on the requirement of the position, with a thorough assessment of his/her performance and character. Probationary period refers to the period of actual service following the issuance of a permanent appointment wherein the appointee undergoes a thorough character investigation and assessment of capability to perform the duties of the position enumerated in the PDF.

During this period, the appointee shall take: (a) a general orientation provided by the agency; and (b) a mandatory onboarding training, for first and second level positions, provided by DAB or a mandatory executive coaching, for second level positions performing executive/managerial functions, also provided by DAB.

Reassignment that results in constructive dismissal must be sufficiently established.

**Article 198. Working Hours.** All Bangsamoro Government officials and employees are required to render eight (8) working hours a day for five (5) working days a week or a total of 40 hours a week, exclusive of time for lunch.

The normal working hours of Bangsamoro Government officials and employees shall be from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., except on Fridays where the office hours for Muslim employees may be from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. During the month of Ramadhan, the latter may likewise report from 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. without noon break and the difference of two (2) hours is not counted as undertime.

In the exigency of service, and as approved by the head of agency, working hours may also be altered to include Saturdays and Sundays; *Provided*, That employees who work on such days may choose a compensatory day-off during weekdays; *Provided, further*, That Saturdays and Sundays are regular workdays and not cases of overtime.

**Article 199. Work Schedule Shifting.** In the exigency of the service, or when necessary by the nature of the work of a particular ministry, office or agency and upon representations with the Commission by the Ministry heads concerned, requests for the rescheduling or shifting of work schedule for a number of working days lesser than the required five (5) days may be allowed provided that Bangsamoro Government officials and employees render a total of 40 hours a week and provided further that the public is assured of core working hours of eight in the morning to five in the afternoon continuously for the duration of the entire work week.

The flexible working hours shall not start earlier than 7:00 a.m. and end later than 7:00 p.m. Hence the public is still assured of the core working hours of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. The public must be assured of continuous service during the period of 12:00 p.m. to 1:00 p.m.

Heads of agencies shall have the authority to approve office working hours, provided that in such working hours officials and employees shall render not less than eight (8) hours a day for five (5) days a week for a total of 40 hours. The flexible working hours adopted by the official or employee shall thereafter be his/her regular working hours which cannot be occasionally or periodically changed at his/her convenience.

A report of flexible working hours adopted by the agency shall be submitted to the CSC for BARMM within 30 days of its implementation.

Employees shall have the option to work during Sundays and be allowed to choose Friday as a compensatory day-off, subject to the approval of the head of agency who shall see to it that it shall not hamper government operation.

**Article 201. Record of Attendance.** All BARMM officers and employees shall record their daily attendance on the proper form or, whenever possible, have them registered on the bundy clock or Biometric Attendance Monitoring System (BAMS). Any other means of recording attendance may be allowed provided their respective names and signatures as well as the time of their actual arrival to and departure from office are indicated, subject to verification. This shall include those serving in the field, that is, outside the office proper, and those on the water or service rendered on board a vessel as the usual place of work. The Record of Attendance which shall be kept in a conspicuous place, shall be in the custody of a responsible officer who shall monitor the arrival, departure of officials and employees.

All other BARMM officials who are not required to use the bundy clock or BAMS shall hereinafter record their attendance in the manner prescribed by the agency and their absences shall be covered with the requisite leave of absence.

**Article 202. Overtime Services.** When the interest of public service so requires, the daily hours of work for BARMM officers and employees may be extended by the head of agency concerned, which extension shall be fixed in accordance with the nature of work. They may also be requested to render overtime work which shall be paid except when rendered in the exigency of the service or when service requires them to work urgently, subject to existing regulations.

**Article 203. Non-Offsetting.** Off-setting of tardiness or absences by working the equivalent number of minutes or hours by which a BARMM officer or employee has been tardy beyond the regular or approved working hours of the employees concerned shall not be allowed.

**Article 204. Undertime.** Any BARMM employee who incurs undertime regardless of the number of minutes/hours, 10 times a month in a semester for at least two (2) consecutive months during the year shall be subject to administrative sanctions prescribed under CSC MC No. 04, s. 1991 (Policy on Absenteeism and Tardiness).

**REHABILITATION PRIVILEGE**

**Article 205. Coverage.** All BARMM personnel with permanent, temporary, casual or contractual appointments, including those with fixed terms of office, may avail themselves of the Rehabilitation Privilege during their employment. Consultants and those hired under contract of service or job order cannot avail themselves of the privilege because they are not government employees.

**Article 206. Availment.** BARMM officials and employees may be entitled to the Rehabilitation Privilege for a maximum period of six (6) months for wounds and/or injuries sustained while in the performance of official duties. The duration, frequency and terms of availing of the privilege shall be based on the recommendation of medical authority. Hence, availing of the privilege may be for less than six (6) months, or may be on half-time basis or an intermittent schedule as determined by medical authorities provided that the cumulative total period of availing of the privilege will not exceed six (6) months.

Illness or sickness resulting from or aggravated by working conditions or the environment cannot be a basis for availing of the Rehabilitation Privilege even if the same may be compensable under the law and regulations of the Employees Compensation Commission (ECC).

**Article 207. Performance of Duty.** For availing oneself of the Rehabilitation Privilege, performance of duty means situation wherein the official or employee was already at work. The same privilege may be extended to officials and employees in situations where the official or employee meets an accident while engaged in activities inherent to the performance of his or her duties, including being on Official Business outside of his or her station, Official Travel, authorized Overtime, Detail Order, and Special Assignment Orders.

Injuries from accidents that occurred while the official or employee was going to work and going home from work may be considered sustained while in the performance of official duties.

Agency heads, in the exercise of sound discretion, shall examine and consider the prevailing or circumstantial factors or conditions of the government official or employee who intends to avail himself or herself of the Rehabilitation Privilege. These may include, but shall not be limited to, the following:

a. Established intent on the part of the official or employee in going to work from home or going home from work;

b. The official or employee is in his or her usual route in going to work from home and going home from work;

c. Reasonable proximity of the accident to the place of work or agency’s premises; and

d. Wounds or injuries were sustained within reasonable time from leaving his or her home or recorded departure from the place of work.

Other rightfully established evidence to merit the entitlement of an official or employee to Rehabilitation Privilege may be considered.

**Article 208. Non-deduction.** Absence from work during the period of Rehabilitation Privilege shall not be deducted from the accumulated sick or vacation leave credits of the official or employee.

However, officials and employees while on Rehabilitation Privilege, do not earn and accumulate vacation leave and sick leave credits.

**Article 209. Benefits.** Bangsamoro officials and employees availing of the Rehabilitation Privilege shall receive their salaries and regular benefits such as Personnel Economic Relief Allowance (PERA), Additional Compensation (AdCom), mid-year bonus, year-end bonus, and cash gift mandated by law.

They are not entitled however to benefits and privileges that are enjoyed based on the actual performance of duties of positions entitled to these benefits such as RATA.

**Article 210. Entitlement to Leave Privileges.** Officers and employees in the civil service shall be entitled to leave of absence, with or without pay, subject to CSC MC No. 41, s. of 1998, as amended by CSC MC No. 15, s. 2020 (Omnibus Rules on Leave) or as may be provided by law and rules and regulations of the Commission.

**Article 211. Reimbursement.** Claimants of Rehabilitation Privilege benefits are entitled to reimbursement by their agency for first-aid expenses, preferably in government facilities. Reimbursement is subject to the availability of funds and shall not exceed 5,000 Pesos unless expenditures beyond said amount are necessary as certified by medical authorities and approved by the head of agency.

For this purpose, first aid refers to the basic medical treatment immediately given to a person hurt in an accident.

**Article 212. Responsibilities of the Agency Head.** The agency head shall determine whether the injuries were incurred while in the performance of duties.

The agency head shall be held responsible and personally liable for any false or fraudulent claims and irregular availing of the privilege.

The agency head, through the agency medical staff and/or the HRMO, should monitor monthly the medical status of the employee undergoing rehabilitation.

**Chapter V**
**PROTECTION DURING GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION**

**Article 213. Removal in case of Bona Fide Reorganization.** In case of implementation of reorganization within BARMM, a valid cause for removal exists when, pursuant to a bona fide reorganization, a position has been abolished or rendered redundant or there is a need to merge, divide, or consolidate positions in order to meet the exigencies of the service, or other lawful causes allowed by the civil service laws. The existence of any or some of the following circumstances may be considered as evidence of bad faith in the removal made as a result of reorganization, giving rise to a claim for reinstatement or reappointment by an aggrieved party:

Said application shall be considered by the Committee in the placement and selection of human resource.

**Article 218. List of Human Resource to be Made Known.** A list of the human resource appointed to the authorized positions in the approved staffing pattern shall be made known to all the officers and employees of the agency.

Reinstatement or Reappointment in case Separation is in Violation of the Code.** All officers and employees who are found by the CSC for BARMM to have been separated in violation of the provisions of this Code, shall be ordered reinstated or reappointed as the case may be without loss of seniority and shall be entitled to full pay for the period of separation. Unless also separated for cause, all officers and employees, who have been separated pursuant to reorganization shall, if entitled thereto, be paid the appropriate separation pay and retirement and other benefits under existing laws within 90 days from the date of the effectivity of their separation or from the date of the receipt of the resolution of their appeals as the case may be; *Provided*, That application for clearance has been filed and no action thereon has been made by the corresponding agency.

**Chapter III**
**COMPLAINT**

**Article 227. Complaint Defined; Who May Initiate.** A complaint is a means of bringing to the attention of the proper disciplining authority the misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance of the person complained of. It may be initiated by the disciplining authority *motu proprio* or upon a valid complaint filed by any person.

**Article 228. Requisites of a Valid Complaint.** A complaint to be valid must be in writing, written in a clear and concise language as to properly apprise the person/s complained of, and must be verified.

However, in cases initiated by the proper disciplining authority, a show cause order why no formal investigation should be conducted against the person complained is sufficient.

The complaint shall contain the following:

a. Full name and address of the complainant;

b. Full name and address of the person complained of, his/her position and office;

c. A narration of the relevant and material facts which shows the acts or omissions complained of; and

d. A certification of non-forum shopping.

**Article 229. Anonymous Complaint.** No anonymous complaint shall be entertained unless the act complained of is of public knowledge or the allegations can be verified or supported by documentary or direct evidence.

**Article 230. Obligation in Case of Anonymous Complaint.** The proper disciplining authority must faithfully evaluate and validate the trustworthiness of the allegations and the genuineness of the documentary evidence and act on it accordingly.

**Article 231. Effects of the Pendency of an Administrative or Criminal Case.** Except as otherwise provided by law, pendency of an administrative or criminal case shall not disqualify the respondent from promotion and other human resource actions or from claiming maternity/paternity benefits.

The release of the retirement benefits of a person with pending case shall be governed by R.A. No. 10154 and its implementing rules.

**Article 232. Withdrawal of the Complaint.** The withdrawal of the complaint does not result in its outright dismissal nor discharge the person complained of from any administrative liability.

In order to expedite the proceedings, the disciplining authority may, in the exercise of his/her sound judgment, consider substantial compliance of the complaint as to prescribed form and substance.

**Chapter IV**
**PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION**

**Article 235. Primary Investigation Defined.** A Preliminary Investigation is a mandatory proceeding to be undertaken by the disciplining authority or his or her representative, the purpose of which is to determine whether a *prima facie* case exists to warrant further investigation.

**Article 236. How Conducted.** Preliminary investigation may be conducted in any of the following manners: a) requiring the submission of counter affidavit or comment and/or other documents from the person complained of within five (5) days from receipt of the complaint which is sufficient in form and substance; b) ex-parte evaluation of the records; or c) clarificatory meeting with the parties to discuss the merits of the case.

When the complaint is initiated by the disciplining authority, it or its authorized representative shall issue a show-cause order directing the person complained of to explain within the same period why no administrative case should be filed against the said person. The failure to submit a comment/counter-affidavit/explanation shall be considered a waiver thereof and the preliminary investigation may be completed even without the counter- affidavit/comment/explanation.

The right to counsel may be exercised even during the preliminary investigation.

**Article 237. Duration of the Preliminary Investigation.** A preliminary investigation shall commence within a non-extendible period of five (5) of days upon receipt of the complaint by the disciplining authority and shall be terminated within 20 days thereafter.

The parties shall then be furnished copy of the order with sufficient explanation of the reason/s for such dismissal.

**Chapter V**
**FORMAL CHARGE**

**Article 239. Issuance of Formal Charge.** Within 15 days from receipt of the Investigation Report, and a *prima facie* case has been properly established, the disciplining authority shall issue a Formal Charge addressed to the respondent, copy furnished the complainant.

**Article 242. Period to File.** The respondent shall have 10 days from receipt of the Formal Charge within which to file his/her answer. Failure to do so shall be considered a waiver on his/her part and the case shall be decided on the basis of the records available within a period of 15 days.

**Chapter VII**
**PREVENTIVE SUSPENSION**

**Article 243. Nature and Purpose.** Preventive Suspension is not a penalty. It is merely a precautionary measure allowed by law in order to temporarily remove the respondent from the scene of the alleged misfeasance/malfeasance/nonfeasance while the case is pending. The purpose of which is to prevent him/her from using his/her office or position in exerting undue influence or pressure on the witnesses and/or tampering with evidence.

**Article 244. Grounds for Issuance.** The proper disciplining authority may, *motu proprio* or upon proper motion by the complainant, place the respondent under preventive suspension upon issuance of the formal charge or immediately thereafter if the charge involves:

a. Dishonesty;

b. Oppression;

c. Grave misconduct;

d. Gross neglect of duty;

e. An administrative offense committed on its second or third time and the penalty thereof is dismissal from the service; or

f. Other offenses punishable by dismissal from the service.

In order for a preventive suspension to be valid, there must be a showing that he/she is in a position to exert undue influence or pressure on the witnesses and/or to tamper with evidence.

**Article 245. Manner of Issuance.** A preventive suspension may be effected by issuance of an order by the proper disciplining authority specifying the ground/s therefor, the evidence against respondent, and a directive to immediately cease and desist from performing his/her official functions as well as from entering the premises of his/her office pending investigation of his/her case. The complainant and other concerned persons or offices shall be furnished copy of the order of preventive suspension.

**Article 246. Duration.** When properly issued, preventive suspension shall commence from the time the order was received by the respondent and shall last upon the lapse of 90 days or after the resolution of his/her case, whichever comes earlier. In the case of employees or officials of component LGUs of the BARMM, the period of preventive suspension shall be up to 60 days only. It is understood that the periods mentioned are only the maximum periods within which to place the respondent under preventive suspension. It does not preclude the proper disciplining authority to place him/her under preventive suspension for a lesser period, so long as it is made in good faith and taking into consideration the nature or gravity of the offense charged.

**Article 247. Effect of the Lapse of the Period.** If the disciplining authority failed to resolve or decide the case after the lapse of the period mentioned above, the respondent shall be automatically reinstated in the service, unless the delay is due to the fault, negligence, or manipulations of the respondent, in which case, the period of delay shall not be included in the counting of the preventive suspension.

**Article 248. Effect of Authorized Leave in Case of Preventive Suspension.** Should the respondent be on authorized leave, the preventive suspension shall be deferred or interrupted until such time that said leave has been fully exhausted.

**Article 249. Number of Preventive Suspension Allowed.** No further preventive suspension arising out of the same charge/s is allowed even if it is merely for the purpose of exhausting the maximum period in a case where lesser period was effected. If the respondent is already placed under preventive suspension, the duration of the second preventive suspension arising out of a different charge/s shall simultaneously run with the first without prejudice to the service of the remaining period of the second.

**Article 250. Alternative to Preventive Suspension.** The proper disciplining authority has the option to reassign the respondent for the same period to another agency as the case may be, if he/she is convinced that the respondent cannot exert undue influence or pressure on the witnesses and/or tamper with evidence to his/her advantage.

**Article 251. Remedies from the Order of Preventive Suspension.** The respondent may, within 15 days from receipt of the preventive suspension order, appeal the same directly to the Commission. Pending appeal, the order shall be executory and no motion for reconsideration is allowed to be entertained by the issuing Ministry.

**Article 252. Void on its Face Order.** Any of the following circumstances shall render the order of preventive suspension void on its face:

a. The order was issued by one who is not authorized by law;

b. The requirements under Article 228 are not present, subject to the exceptions in Article 229 of this Code;

c. The order was issued without a formal charge or the same is defective; and

d. The period of preventive suspension as imposed has exceeded the prescribed periods.

**Article 253. Payment of Back Wages and Reinstatement in case of a Void on its Face Order.** A declaration by the higher authority of the order of preventive suspension as void on its face shall entitle the respondent to immediate reinstatement and payment of back wages corresponding to the period of the illegal preventive suspension without awaiting the outcome of the main case.

A declaration of invalidity based on ground/s other than those mentioned in the immediately preceding section shall result in the reinstatement of the respondent but the payment of back wages shall be subject to the final outcome of the main case. If he/she is exonerated or the penalty imposed is only reprimand, he/she shall be entitled to back wages. Otherwise, he/she shall not be entitled thereto.

Mere downgrading of the charge to a lesser offense does not amount to exoneration and shall not entitle the respondent to payment of back wages.

**Chapter VIII**
**FORMAL INVESTIGATION**

**Article 254. Instances Required.** A formal investigation shall be conducted where the merits of the case cannot be decided judiciously without conducting such investigation or when the respondent elects to have one.

**Article 255. When to be Conducted.** The investigation shall be held not earlier than five (5) days nor later than 10 days from receipt of the respondent’s answer or upon the expiration of the period to answer. Said investigation shall be finished within 30 days from the issuance of the formal charge/notice of charge unless the period is extended by the disciplining authority or its authorized representative, or heads of agencies or the Commission in meritorious cases.

For this purpose, the Commission may entrust the formal investigation to lawyers of other agencies pursuant to this Code.

**Article 256. How Conducted.** The formal investigation shall commence by conducting a pre-hearing conference for the parties to appear, consider and agree on the following matters, to wit:

a. Stipulation of facts;

b. Simplification of issues;

c. Identification and marking of evidence;

d. Waiver of objections to admissibility of evidence;

e. Limitation on the names and number of witnesses;

f. Hearing dates; and

g. Such other matters as may aid in the speedy and just resolution of the case.

The agreement between the parties shall be reduced in writing and signed by them or their authorized representatives. The same shall be embodied in the pre-hearing order and shall be binding upon the parties.

The conduct of pre-hearing conference in cases where formal investigation is required is mandatory for the hearing officer. Failure of any party to attend such conference may be sufficient ground to consider the case submitted for decision. Hence, the case may be decided on the basis of the records available.

**Article 257. Continuous Hearing.** Hearings shall be conducted on the hearing dates agreed upon during the pre-hearing conference which shall not be more than five (5) hearing days. No postponement shall be allowed except in highly exceptional circumstances and upon a proper written motion filed by any party at least three (3) days before the scheduled hearing to be postponed. The parties are required to be present during the hearings and their absence shall produce the same result as in the case of absence of any party during pre-hearing conference. At any time before the resolution of the case, the parties may agree in writing to submit the case for resolution by the disciplining authority.

**Article 258. Hearings, How Conducted.** Hearings before any of the proper disciplining authorities under this Book shall be conducted primarily for the purpose of securing a just, speedy, and fair resolution of administrative cases brought before it. They should not be conducted in such manner as to put excessive burden on the parties thereby discouraging them to resort to democratic processes. Taking these into account, hearings shall not be conducted in a strictly adversarial or trial-type proceedings. It is sufficient for the parties to be given ample opportunities to be heard and present their witnesses and other evidence for the consideration of the hearing officer/s.

**Article 259. Order of Hearing:**
