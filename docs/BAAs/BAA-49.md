**BASIC PRINCIPLES**

**CHAPTER I**

**THE CODE, POLICY AND APPLICATION**

**SECTION 1. *Title.*** – This Act shall be known and cited as the “*Bangsamoro Local Governance Code of 2023.*”

**SEC. 2. *Declaration of Policy.*** –

(a) It is hereby declared the policy of the Bangsamoro Government that its territorial and political subdivisions shall enjoy genuine and meaningful local autonomy and self-governance to enable them to attain full development as self-reliant communities and become effective partners in the attainment of holistic Bangsamoro development. Toward this end, the Bangsamoro Government, pursuant to the principles of moral governance, shall provide for a more responsive and accountable local government structure instituted through a system of decentralization whereby constituent local government units shall be given more powers, authority, responsibilities, and resources in a gradual and systematic approach. The process of decentralization shall proceed from the Bangsamoro Government to its constituent local government units.

(b) It is also the policy of the Bangsamoro Government to ensure the accountability of local government units through the institution of effective mechanisms of recall, initiative, referendum, and administrative supervision.

(c) It is likewise a policy of the Bangsamoro Government for ministries, offices, and agencies to conduct periodic public consultations with the appropriate local government units, non-governmental and people’s organizations, and other concerned sectors of the community in relation to any project or program for implementation in their respective jurisdictions. For this purpose, existing and future regional mechanisms such as the Bangsamoro Economic and Development Council (BEDC) shall be optimized.

(d) Finally, programs and projects funded by the national government, as well as national policies and standards, for implementation in constituent local government units of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) shall be governed by policies on mandatory consultation and coordination with the Bangsamoro Government, subject to any prior or subsequent agreement in the Intergovernmental Relations Body, in accordance with Republic Act (R.A.) No. 11054, otherwise known as the “*Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.*”

Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the local government units from accessing or receiving resources, programs, and projects from sources other than those provided by the Bangsamoro Government.

**SEC. 3. *Operative Principles of Decentralization.*** – The formulation and implementation of policies and measures on local autonomy shall be guided by the following operative principles:

(a) There shall be an effective and systematic allocation among the different constituent local government units of their respective powers, functions, responsibilities, and resources;

(b) There shall be established in every constituent local government unit an accountable, efficient, and dynamic organizational structure and operating mechanism that will meet the priority needs and service requirements of its communities;

(c) Local officials and employees whose salaries are fully charged against the local funds shall, unless otherwise provided under this Code, be appointed by the governor, mayor, or punong barangay, or the vice governor or vice mayor, as the case may be, according to merit and fitness, and may only be removed for cause, subject to the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act (BAA) No. 17, otherwise known as the “*Bangsamoro Civil Service Code (BCSC)*”, and other civil service laws, rules, and regulations;

(d) The vesting of duty, responsibility, and accountability in constituent local government units shall be accompanied by provision for reasonably adequate resources to discharge their powers and effectively carry out their functions. Hence, they shall have the power to create and broaden their own sources of revenue, and the right to a just share in the national taxes and an equitable share in the proceeds of the utilization and development of the natural resources within their respective areas;

(e) The BARMM with respect to constituent provinces, independent component cities, and highly-urbanized cities, the provinces with respect to component cities and municipalities, and the cities and municipalities with respect to component barangays, shall ensure that the acts of their constituent units are within the scope of their prescribed powers and functions. Correspondingly, the Ministry of the Interior and Local Government (MILG) shall ensure faithful compliance by the constituent local government units with their obligations through the proper use of their prescribed powers and accomplishment of their functions;

(f) Constituent local government units may group themselves, consolidate or coordinate their efforts, services, and resources for purposes of promoting the general welfare and the common good;

(g) The capabilities of constituent local government units in the BARMM, especially the municipalities and barangays, shall be strengthened by providing them with opportunities to participate actively in the implementation of regional policies, programs, and projects;

(h) There shall be a continuing mechanism to enhance local autonomy not only by legislative enabling acts but also by administrative and organizational reforms;

(i) Constituent local government units shall share with the Bangsamoro Government the responsibility in the management and maintenance of ecological balance within their territorial jurisdiction, subject to the provisions of this Code and national and regional policies;

(j) Effective mechanisms for ensuring the accountability of constituent local government units to their respective constituents shall be strengthened in order to upgrade continually the quality of local leadership;

(k) The realization of local autonomy shall be facilitated through improved coordination of the regional government policies and programs and extension of adequate financial, technical, and material assistance to less developed and deserving constituent local government units;

(l) The participation of the private sector in local governance, particularly in the delivery of basic services, shall be strengthened to ensure the viability of local autonomy as a primary regional strategy for sustainable Bangsamoro development; and

(m) The Bangsamoro Government shall ensure that gradual decentralization contributes to the continuing improvement of the performance of constituent local government units and the quality of life of the Bangsamoro people.

**SEC. 4. *Scope of Application.*** – This Code shall apply to all constituent provinces, cities, municipalities, barangays, and other political subdivisions as may be created by law, and to the extent herein provided, officials, offices, or agencies of the Bangsamoro Government.

**SEC. 5. *Rules of Interpretation.*** – In the interpretation of the provisions of this Code, the following rules shall apply:

(a) Any provision on a power of a constituent local government unit shall be liberally interpreted in its favor, and in case of doubt, any question thereon shall be resolved in favor of devolution of powers and of the lower local government unit. Any fair and reasonable doubt as to the existence of the power shall be interpreted in favor of the constituent local government unit concerned;

(b) In case of doubt, any tax ordinance or revenue measure shall be construed strictly against the local government unit enacting it, and liberally in favor of the taxpayer. Any tax exemption, incentive, or relief granted by any local government unit pursuant to the provisions of this Code shall be construed strictly against the person claiming it;

(c) The general welfare provisions in this Code shall be liberally interpreted to give more powers to constituent local government units in accelerating economic development and upgrading the quality of life for the people in the community; and

(d) In the resolution of controversies arising under this Code where no legal provision or jurisprudence applies, resort may be had to the customs and traditions in the place where the controversies take place.
