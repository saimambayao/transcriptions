Established appropriate bureaucracy for the Bangsamoro that will ensure the right balance between the seize of the bureaucracy and the service that need to be delivered as well as the appropriate skills required of people in the bureaucracy.

Implemented programs and projects responsive to the pressing social and economic challenges in the Bangsamoro such as poverty, education, health, access to clean water and electricity, job opportunity, agricultural productivity, and access to capital market. "These must be implemented with responsive strategic infrastructure in the region such as ports, road, network, flood control, and logistics and communication facilities."
