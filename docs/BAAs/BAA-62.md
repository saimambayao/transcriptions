For purposes of effective programming, monitoring, and evaluation, the Bangsamoro Government, through the Bangsamoro Internal Displacement Coordinating Council (BIDCC or the Council), shall develop and adopt a standard categorization of protracted displacement, including a specific timeframe, taking into account the local context and experiences within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

**CHAPTER II
PROTECTING AND PROMOTING THE RIGHTS OF IDPs**

**SEC. 5. Protection from Displacement and Additional Measures to Prevent Displacement.** — The Bangsamoro Government, as well as its constituent LGUs, shall take all measures to address displacement, including instances of protracted displacement, and shall prevent the occurrence thereof. Prior to making any decision requiring the displacement of persons, the authorities concerned shall ensure that feasible alternatives are explored in order to avoid displacement altogether. Where no alternatives exist, all necessary measures shall be taken to minimize displacement and its adverse effects.

Additional measures of prevention shall consist of, but not limited to, the following situations:

a) Development Projects. — Displacement of populations caused by development projects shall be allowed only when it is authorized by law, justified by compelling public interests, deemed necessary to protect these interests, and conducted with full respect for the human rights of affected persons.

Whenever a development project is planned and subjected for approval by any government authority or agency within the Bangsamoro, it shall be required that the proponent shall submit to the approving authority an impact assessment. This assessment should evaluate the risk of displacement on the affected population including specific vulnerable sectors, such as women, children, and informal settlers. It must also include corresponding plans to mitigate, manage, or respond to such risk. The assessment may either be part of the feasibility study or a separate document. This is without prejudice to the provisions of Section 32 of Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 49.

The Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources, and Energy (MENRE) shall require applicants for Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) to provide an impact assessment. This assessment must demonstrate that no population will be displaced by the project. If displacement is unavoidable, the assessment must show that the affected populations have been consulted and a rights-based relocation plan is in place for them.

In addition, the proper implementation of the relocation plan for affected residents, if applicable, shall also be included among the requirements for renewal of any permits or certifications, along with any other requirements that may be imposed by the issuing agency.

When the affected population belongs to an indigenous persons’ (IP) community in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, the Ministry of Indigenous People’s Affairs (MIPA) shall likewise be considered as an approving authority.

b) Armed conflict. — The relevant agencies and authorities in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region shall undertake proactive monitoring of the implementation of the peace agreements and the observance and promotion of international humanitarian law.

In relation to the implementation of the 2014 Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB) between the Government of the Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, relevant agencies and authorities in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region shall ensure that all measures to prevent displacement due to armed conflict are aligned with the Annex on Normalization of the CAB.

c) Clan wars and political violence. — In accordance with its mandate under Title X, Section 3 of the Bangsamoro Administrative Code, the Ministry of Public Order and Safety (MPOS) shall formulate and implement policies and programs for the effective settlement of clan conflicts, including but not limited to “rido” (clan wars) and other horizontal conflicts in the region, as well as for the prevention of recurrence of such conflicts, especially in areas that experience high rates of displacement.

Whenever possible, conflict resolution agreements, facilitated by the MPOS at the local level, shall include provisions regarding access to both formal and informal mechanisms for resolving property disputes and other matters that will prevent further displacements. This also applies to disputes, including rido, that are settled by the ad hoc bodies of the local peace and order councils, as outlined in Section 128 of Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 49.

d) Disaster prevention and preparedness. — The Bangsamoro Government shall ensure the respect, promotion, protection, and fulfillment of the rights of IDPs in the implementation of its Regional Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan (RDRRMP) as provided in applicable regional and national laws and issuances. Towards this end, the competent authorities of the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure proper coordination in the implementation of the RDRRMP.

**SEC. 6. Rights During and After Displacement.** — The following rights shall be granted to IDPs during and after displacement, without discrimination of any kind on account of their being displaced, race, color, sex, gender, language, religion, belief, political or other opinion, national, ethnic, or social origin, legal or social status, age, disability, property, birth, or on any other similar criteria. These rights shall be fully observed in accordance with the 1987 Philippine Constitution.

In any assessments or profiling that may be conducted by Bangsamoro Government agencies and LGUs related to assistance during displacement, the concerned agency, together with any non-government organizations or private persons working with it, shall include identification of vulnerable populations or persons with special needs.

3. Adequate and appropriate clothing and essential non-food items, including dignity kits for women and girls; and
