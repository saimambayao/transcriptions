**CHAPTER I**
**PRELIMINARY PROVISIONS**

**SECTION 1. *Short Title.*** – This Act shall be known as the “*Rights of Internally Displaced Persons of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region Act of 2024.*”

**SEC. 2. *Declaration of Principles and Policies.*** – The Bangsamoro Government hereby adopts a rights-based approach to promote and protect the rights of internally displaced persons (IDPs) from and within the Bangsamoro Region, consistent with the principles enshrined in the 1987 Philippine Constitution, the standards set by international humanitarian law and human rights laws, international treaties and conventions adhered to by the Philippines, including the United Nations Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement (UNGPID), and the provisions prescribed by Republic Act No. 11054 otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL).

In the event of an armed conflict, the parties thereto shall ensure the respect, protection, and promotion of the rights of the victims of armed conflict in accordance with international humanitarian law and international human rights law.

It is further declared the policy of the Bangsamoro Government to pursue durable solutions to displacement, considering the socio-economic needs of affected non-displaced populations and the attainment of sustainable economic goals, and to prioritize the reintegration of IDPs to the society.

Further, in implementing existing laws, rules, and regulations, constituent local government units, all agencies, and instrumentalities of the Bangsamoro Government shall adhere to the respect, promotion, and protection of the human rights of IDPs, and ensure the fullest protection for at-risk and vulnerable populations who are subjected to displacement, including women, girls, and children.

Furthermore, in accordance with Article X of the BOL, the Bangsamoro Government commits to ensure that all efforts to protect and assist IDPs are guided by the principles and objectives of *Shari’ah*, including the preservation of life, intellect, faith, posterity, and property of its constituents. These principles shall shape the overall approach and policy framework for safeguarding the rights and welfare of IDPs.

**SEC. 3. *Definition of Terms.*** – The following terms as used in this Act shall mean:

a) “*Aggressive implementation of development projects*” refers to the execution of activity aimed at economic or political growth, advancement, and expansion that results or may result to arbitrary internal displacement of persons, as defined in Section 5 of this Act. This includes instances where displacement occurs due to:

1. Lack of adherence to the principles outlined in Section 5(a), such as failure to explore feasible alternatives to displacement, ensure a compelling public interest, or protect the human rights of affected persons;
2. Failure to conduct or adequately address the findings of an impact assessment regarding the risk of displacement, as required under Section 5(a); and
3. Non-compliance with any requirements related to relocation plans for affected populations, including those outlined in Section 5(a) for both general populations and indigenous peoples (IP) communities.

*Provided, That the term does not include legitimate resettlement schemes and/or programs that adhere to the principles and procedures outlined in Section 5 of this Act;*

Armed conflict can be classified as either international, meaning it occurs between two (2) or more states, including belligerent occupation, or non-international meaning it occurs between governmental authorities and organized armed groups, or between such groups within a state. The armed confrontation must reach a minimum level of intensity and the parties involved in the conflict must show a minimum degree of organization. It does not cover less serious forms of violence, such as internal disturbances and tensions, riots, or acts of banditry.

c) “*Children*” refers to any person under eighteen (18) years of age, as well as those over who are unable to fully care for themselves or protect themselves from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation, or discrimination due to a physical or mental disability or condition.

f) “*Disaster*” refers to a serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society, involving widespread human, material, economic, or environmental losses and impacts, which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources. Disasters are often described as a result of the combination of the following:

1. The exposure to a hazard;
2. The conditions of vulnerability that are present; and
3. Insufficient capacity or measures to reduce or cope with the potential negative consequences.
