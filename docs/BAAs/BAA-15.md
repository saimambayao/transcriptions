**INTRODUCTION**

This 2020, the Bangsamoro Government has charged through turbulent times. The Bangsamoro Government, taking cognizance of the changes brought about by the "New Normal", continued to tackle the challenge to deliver its services to the Bangsamoro People.

Looking ahead, the leadership of the Bangsamoro Government sees that it will continue to operate in an increasingly volatile, complex and uncertain environment. The Bangsamoro Government also recognizes the urgent need for recovery in various aspects of the people's lives after the crisis brought about by the pandemic and also the need to establish systemic changes that will ensure social dexterity and economic integrity.

Acknowledging the many new considerations, the new challenges, and the new ways of doing things, the Bangsamoro Government pledges to continue with working to turn to reality the 12-point Priority Agenda of the Chief Minister as embodied in the 1st Bangsamoro Development Plan 2020-2022 as aligned with the Duterte Administration's 0+10 Point Socio Economic Agenda and the Philippine Development Plan.

As such, the Bangsamoro Government hereby presents the FY 2021 General Appropriations Act of the Bangsamoro. This document is the financial expression of the Bangsamoro Government's action plan to take on the challenge of achieving the eight (8) development goals stated in the 1st Bangsamoro Development Plan which aim to uplift the lives of the Bangsamoro and establish the foundations of self-governance through moral governance.
