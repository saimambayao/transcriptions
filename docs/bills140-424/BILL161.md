**AN ACT INCREASING THE BED CAPACITY OF LUUK DISTRICT HOSPITAL IN TUBIG PUTIH, MUNICIPALITY OF LUUK, PROVINCE OF SULU, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The 1987 Philippine Constitution, in Section 15 Article III, declares that the State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. Section 11 Article XIII declares that the State shall adopt an integrated and comprehensive approach to health development that shall endeavor to make essential goods, health and other social services available to all the people at affordable cost¹.

Similarly, Section 22, Article IX of Republic Act 11054 otherwise known as the “Bangsamoro Organic Law” provides that “The Bangsamoro Government shall adopt a policy on health that provides for a comprehensive and integrated health service delivery for its constituents. It shall **establish by law a general hospital system to serve the health requirements of its people and ensure that the individual basic right to life shall be attainable through the prompt intervention of excellent and affordable medical services”.**

The island province of Sulu is home to more than 1,000,108 people as per the latest census of the Philippine statistics authority. ² According to the standards set out by the National Government under AO 2006-0004 of the Department of Health, the hospital bed-to-population ratio should not be more than 1 bed per 1000 population.³ In the island province however, only 320 beds are available to service the 1 million population of Sulu which leaves us at a deficit of 680 beds from the ideal standards of a set-up by the National Government. Even with the additional 200 beds to be added which would come by virtue of the upgrade of Sulu Provincial Hospital and the establishment of the Maimbung District Hospital, a total of 480 beds would still be needed in the province. Moreso in the eastern portion of the island which is only currently being serviced by a 25-bed capacity infirmary and a 25-bed capacity Level 1 district Hospital for the 4 municipalities of Luuk, Old Panamao, Kalingalan Caluang, and the coastal Municipality of Omar which collectively house a population of more than 155,000 people in a land area of more than 900 square kilometers.⁴

To put things into perspective, a patient has to travel for more than an hour to reach the Provincial Hospital in Jolo in case the Luuk District Hospital (LDH) is overwhelmed by patients and cannot be transferred to the Panamao infirmary just like what happened during the onslaught of the COVID-19 Pandemic. That travel time can mean the life and death of a person in emergent situations.

Through this bill, we would be able to greatly improve the service level of healthcare in the eastern part of the island province by allocating more funds necessary to upgrade Luuk District Hospital’s bed capacity. As a level 1 district Hospital, LDH can already cater to Major and Minor Surgeries, Emergency care, Obstetrics and Neonatal care, Laboratory specimen testing, Out Patient Services and even Dental services. It is opportune that we already have a district hospital that can offer a wide array of services with only the need for an upgrade in order to serve the people of Sulu better. With the additional beds, staff and equipment that come with this hospital upgrade, we should be one step closer to bridging the gap between our service level of health care to the ideal set-up and becoming the model of government service that the Bangsamoro have always aspired for our people. In the same manner, we in the Parliament would also be a leap closer to fulfilling our mandate given by the Bangsamoro Organic Law to “...<u>establish by law a general hospital system to serve the health requirements of its people and ensure that the individual basic right to life shall be attainable through the prompt intervention of excellent and affordable medical services</u>⁵”.

It is with these sentiments that I present this bill for the approval of my colleagues in the Parliament.
