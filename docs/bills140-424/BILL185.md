**AN ACT PROVIDING FOR BASIC DIGITAL LITERACY AND INTERMEDIATE INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES (ICT) SKILLS TRAINING IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The measure recognizes that digital literacy and ICT skills are essential in today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, and that lack of access to such training can limit economic opportunities and social inclusion. The measure aims to promote digital literacy and ICT skills training to ensure that the people of the BARMM are equipped with the necessary skills to compete in the digital age.

The proposed measure provides for the establishment of a program for basic digital literacy and intermediate ICT skills training in the BARMM. The program shall include courses on computer hardware and software, internet and email use, and social media management, among others. The program shall also provide for the training of trainers to ensure the sustainability of the program.

The measure also appropriates funds for the implementation of the program, including the construction of training facilities, procurement of equipment, and payment of salaries and benefits for trainers and staff. The program shall be implemented by the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education of the BARMM, in coordination with relevant government agencies, non-government organizations, and private sector partners.

Furthermore, the proposed measure recognizes the importance of gender-sensitive and culturally-appropriate approaches to digital literacy and ICT skills training in the BARMM. The program shall ensure that the needs and perspectives of women, persons with disabilities, and other marginalized groups are taken into consideration in the design and implementation of the training.

In conclusion, this proposed measure is a necessary step towards promoting digital literacy and ICT skills training in the BARMM. It is envisioned that this program will contribute to the economic development of the region by providing the necessary skills and knowledge to the people of BARMM, and will help to promote social inclusion and equality by ensuring that all members of the community have access to the opportunities presented by the digital age.

In view of the foregoing, approval of this bill is earnestly sought.
