**AN ACT**
**DECLARING “KUTAWATO CAVE” LOCATED IN BARANGAY ROSARY HEIGHTS 1, CITY OF COTABATO, A HISTORICAL HERITAGE SITE AND AN ECOTOURISM DESTINATION, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Kutawatu Cave, located in Brgy. Rosary Heights 1 in Cotabato City is among the numerous attractions that can be found in the Bangsamoro Region, which is rich in historical and cultural values.

During the Spanish subjugation, the cave became the refuge of our forefathers. At the height of the Japanese invasion, the same cave served the many purposes of our guerrillas.

Among its unique features is the fact that it is the only cave in the entire country that is located in the heart of the city and has many hidden underground passageways, one of which connects to the oldest church in the city, the Tamontaka Church. It is also the source of the city’s name.

Yet, aside from the modest efforts of the City Government of Cotabato to secure the same, no importance was given to it by the national agencies.

Fortunately, our Mujahideen, some of whom are members of this august body, had succeeded in securing for the Bangsamoro our rights to self-governance and the freedom to pursue our own political, economic, social, and cultural development. For this purpose, Section 24 of the Bangsamoro Organic Law mandates the Bangsamoro Government to “preserve the history, culture, art traditions, and the rich cultural heritage of the Bangsamoro people and their Sultanates, such as those of Sulu, Maguindanao, Kabuntalan, Buayan, the Royal House of Ranao and of the Iranun, and the non-Moro indigenous peoples of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.”

It, therefore, behooves us that we take steps to protect and preserve this monument as a source of our pride and part of our history of struggle. This proposed bill is among our small steps to preserve our history, culture, and heritage.

I, therefore, seek your support for the passage of this bill.
