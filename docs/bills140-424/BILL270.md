**AN ACT PROVIDING FOR BEREAVEMENT LEAVE OF FIVE (5) DAYS WITH HALF-PAY TO REGULAR AND CONTRACTUAL EMPLOYEES IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

While death of a loved one and grief is an inevitable experience, a bereavement leave to allow an employee or a worker mourn their loss is a leave that is overlooked and unrecognized by employers, both in the public and private sector.

This puts an employee in a prejudiced condition as they have to make use and exhaust all their leaves for the year inorder to attend to their grief and to the rites that are associated with the funeral of a loved one. In cases where there are no leaves available to an employee/worker, they are constrained to absent without leave and risk their employment records or to miss their attendance in the funeral of immediate family member. This is a situation that is not fair and highly unfavorable to the employee or a worker and a predicament not sanctioned under our constitutional laws on family being the foundation of nation (*Section 1, Article XV, 1987 Constitution*) and on labor as primary social economic force (*Section 18, Article II, 1987 Constitution*).

Further, the grant of bereavement leave is much more essential and vital in the context of Bangsamoro people where customary services are performed as part of their customary culture and practice. It is an integral part of the Moro culture to immediately arrange and conduct the burial of their loved and to perform *Janazah*. Thereafter, it is customary to gather for an average of four (4) days after the death of a family member or a kin. The gathering allows the family to mourn and to be consoled by the visiting relatives and friends.

Thus, more than the fair consideration that is afforded by this proposal to the labor, this also seeks to put value into the belief, customs, and practices of the Bangsamoro people by allowing them to grief for their loved ones and to be present during the performance of our customary services.

This bill is being proposed to provide remedy for the gap under our labor laws in relation to the lack of recognition of an employee/worker’s bereavement and the preservation of our customs as people. Hence, its passage is earnestly sought.
