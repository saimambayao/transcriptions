Private Member Bill No. **366**

Principal Author: MP Abrar Jainuddin Hataman

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

It is an elementary principle that public office is a public trust. Public officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency.¹ While society rightly imposes high standard of diligence among its civil servants, we must also acknowledge a fundamental truth that our public officers and employees are human too. The guardians of the government are not operated by mechanics, they are vulnerable to fatigue, illness, or stress. They face the same physical and mental health challenges as the very people they serve.

This bill seeks to institutionalize the provision of Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) benefits to all employees of the Bangsamoro Government. Its primary objective is to ensure that every public servant under the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) has access to quality, affordable, and timely medical care without the burden of high out-of-pocket expenses.

This bill enforces the mandate of the Bangsamoro Government by upholding the right of BARMM employees to a complete and integrated system of quality, accessible and affordable health care.² In doing so, it also strengthens the institutional capacity of the regional government to effectively serve the needs of the Bangsamoro people.

Furthermore, by establishing a comprehensive HMO program to BARMM Employees, the Bangsamoro Government does not only improve BARMM employees' welfare, morale, and productivity but also reduce absenteeism due to health-related concerns and attract and retain highly competent professionals in the regional government;

Ultimately, ensuring the health and wellness of public servants is not merely a matter of employee benefit, it is a matter of good governance. A healthy bureaucracy is the backbone of a healthy government.

In view of the foregoing, the immediate passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
