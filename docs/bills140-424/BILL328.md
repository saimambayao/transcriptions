**AN ACT**
**RENAMING THE MUNICIPALITY OF DATU BLAH T. SINSUAT, MAGUINDANAO DEL NORTE TO MUNICIPALITY OF WEST UPI, MAGUINDANAO DEL NORTE**

**Explanatory Note**

Under Section 25, Article II of the 1987 Constitution, the State shall ensure the autonomy of local governments. Further, under Section 2, Article X thereof, it is provided that the territorial and political subdivisions shall enjoy local autonomy.

Likewise, Section 13 (a) of Republic Act No. 7160, as amended, otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991, provides that "[t]he Sangguniang Panlalawigan may, in consultation with the Philippine Historical Commission (PHC), change the name of component cities and municipalities within its territorial jurisdiction, upon the recommendation of the Sanggunian concerned."

Meanwhile, the Revised Guidelines on the Naming and Renaming of Streets, Public Schools, Plazas, Building, Bridges, and other Public Structures issued by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) provides that the present names of provinces, cities, towns, and barangays may be renamed, provided that the renaming shall be a reversion of their old names, found to be more culturally and historically significant.

The municipality of Datu Blah T. Sinsuat is one of the municipalities of Maguindanao del Norte which is formerly part of North Upi, Maguindanao. It was created pursuant to Muslim Mindanao Autonomy (MMA) Act No. 198 dated October 24, 2005 and ratified through Commission on Elections (COMELEC) plebiscite on July 15, 2006. It is composed of 13 barangays namely 1) Kinimi, 2) Laguitan, 3) Lapaken, 4) Matuber, 5) Meti, 6) Nalkan, 7) Pinansaran, 8) Pura, 9) Resa, 10) Sedem, 11) Sinipak, 12) Tambak, and 13) Tubuan. It is a population of 28,243 based on 2020 Census on Population and Housing.

This municipality is named after Datu Blah T. Sinsuat (1908-1981), Maguindanao's delegate to the 1935 Constitutional Convention and Cotabato's Lone Representative to the 2nd Congress of the Philippines.

The municipality of Datu Blah T. Sinsuat, based on historical and geographical considerations, was originally part of Upi and was geographically situated on its west coast. As situated on the west coast of Upi, the people used to call the place "West Upi". Consequently, the proposed renaming of the said municipality as the "Municipality of West Upi" reflects this historical and geographical identity, which the community wishes to preserve.¹

Further, this renaming has been endorsed by the provincial and the municipal local governments concerned ("*Sanggunians*" for brevity). Resolutions endorsing the proposed renaming of Datu Blah T. Sinsuat as "Municipality of West Upi" have been adopted by the *Sangguniang Panlalawigan* of Maguindanao del Norte, through its Resolution No. 2024-01-80; the *Sangguniang Bayan* of Datu Blah T. Sinsuat, through its Resolution No. 04-02, series of 2024; and the 13 *Sangguniang Barangay Councils* of the Municipality of Datu Blah T. Sinsuat, through several resolutions recommending the renaming of the said municipality to "Municipality of West Upi".

Henceforth, it is thus appropriate to revert the name of the Municipality of Datu Blah T. Sinsuat to its former name, "West Upi" in order to preserve its geographical identity and to honor the historical and cultural values that are essential to people's sense of security and belonging. Furthermore, it is the collective opinion of the concerned *Sanggunians* to refrain from naming the town after an individual. This consensus is intended to prevent claims that the town belongs to a particular clan and is in order to promote a democracy free from the culture of political dynasties.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
