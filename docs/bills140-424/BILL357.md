**AN ACT REGULATING THE OPERATIONS OF MOTORCYCLES-FOR-HIRES AND PROVIDING MANDATORY STATUTORY BENEFITS TO ITS RIDERS**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Motorcycles-for-hire have become an indispensable part of the local transport system in many areas across the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region and the rest of the country. Known by various names such as *habal-habal*, *angkas*, and motor taxis, these services are often the most accessible and practical means of transportation, particularly in our growing urbanized communities and even in remote or geographically challenging communities. It became popular because of its accessibility, speed, and flexibility. Citing a study by research firm WR Numero, it revealed that 45 percent of Filipinos use *habal-habal* for transportation, with 14 percent reporting regular usage and 11 percent using it two to four times weekly. $^1$ However, the same is unregulated and there is no policy for its operation.

They also serve as a primary source of livelihood for many riders. Motorcycle taxis provides employment, especially for the young and uneducated, in countries where unemployment rate is high. $^2$ These commercial motorcycles can be a source of income for the unskilled, semi-skilled and the socially marginalized and improving economy in rural communities. $^3$

Despite their growing prevalence and importance, the operations of motorcycles-for-hire remain largely unregulated. This lack of legal structure exposes both riders and commuters to safety risks and leaves motorcycle riders without access to basic labor rights and social protection mechanisms such as health insurance, accident benefits, or retirement security.

This bill seeks to address that gap by regulating the operations of motorcycles-for-hire and ensuring that riders are afforded mandatory statutory benefits. The measure proposes a framework for the registration, franchising, operation, and oversight of motorcycles-for-hire and mandates the inclusion of their riders in existing social protection programs.

This bill acknowledges the dignity of labor and provides essential protections to one of the region’s most underrecognized workforces. Another important facet of this proposal is to improve public safety by regulating and providing mechanisms in regulating the motor vehicles and the fitness of the riders.

The proposal is firmly grounded under Section 38 of Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law, which provides that: "*The Bangsamoro Government shall have the authority to grant regional franchises, licenses, and permits to land, sea, and air transportation plying routes in the provinces or cities within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.*" $^4$

Further, the authority of municipal governments to regulate transportation is also clearly defined under the Bangsamoro Local Governance Code. In Section 480 (XII)(C) of the said law, the provision provides that the municipalities are mandated to perform functions under the category of transportation and communications. Specifically, the law provides that

(c) In accordance with the guidelines prescribed by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC):

1. Regulate the operation of and grant franchises for three-wheeled vehicles such as tricycles, ‘*payong-payong*’, *sikad-sikad*, and the like, within the territorial jurisdiction of the municipality; and

2. Regulate and grant franchises on non-motorized bancas operating as transport for inter-barangay and intra-municipal waters and ways subject to relevant regional rules and regulations. $^5$

The import of this provision suggest that there has to be a prior guidelines first from the MOTC before the LGUs could exercise such power. This proposal will build on that authority to establish clear, lawful, and enforceable standards for motorcycles-for-hire.

Ultimately, this measure is being proposed in the interest of protecting the riding public and promoting the labor rights of thousands of motorcycle riders. Hence, its passage is earnestly sought.
