**AN ACT PROVIDING FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF DRUG TREATMENT AND REHABILITATION CENTERS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency reported that a total of 3,079 cases arising from violation of Republic Act No. 9165 or the Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 have been filed with the Regional Trial Courts of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao from 2002 to April 2023. These cases include illegal drug possession, manufacturing, trafficking and selling. Of these cases filed, 380 resulted in conviction, 390 resulted in dismissal, 15 resulted in acquittal, 34 were provisionally dismissed, 102 were archived, and 2,158 are pending with the courts.

With the national government’s intensified campaign against illegal drugs, drug-related cases are filing up the dockets of the court which also leads to more people flooding rehab facilities across the country as persons found by the court to be positive for the use of dangerous drugs as well as accused in minor drug crimes who avail of plea bargaining agreement are required to be submitted to confinement, treatment and rehabilitation.

However, due to lack of these essential facilities here at home, they have to be sent outside of the autonomous region for treatment and rehabilitation where they also faced the prospect of being refused either due to lack of the means to pay the cost of treatment or the facilities are already at full capacity. With only less than fifty (50) rehabilitation centers around the country, there are not enough adequate medical treatment for thousands of drug users needing rehabilitation.

While the government continues to take strong actions against narcotic drugs, it also recognizes the necessity of providing effective mechanisms or measures to re-integrate into society individuals who have fallen victims to drug abuse or dangerous drug dependence through sustainable programs of treatment and rehabilitation.

Through this bill, greater access to quality and affordable treatment will be provided to drug victims in the Bangsamoro region. The complete treatment and rehabilitation of drug dependents will allow them to be reintegrated into society and give them the chance to change and rebuild their life with their loved ones.

The immediate approval of this bill is earnestly sought.
