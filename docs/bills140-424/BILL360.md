**AN ACT**
**MANDATING THE MINISTRY OF BASIC, HIGHER, AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION (MBHTE) TO INTEGRATE BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF BANGSAMORO HISTORY INTO THE SECONDARY EDUCATION CURRICULUM OF ALL PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM), APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES¹**

**Explanatory Note**

The right to education is a universally recognized human right, as articulated in Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which affirms that everyone has the right to education.

The 1987 Philippine Constitution, under Section 1, Article XIV, mandates the State to protect and promote the right of all citizens to quality education at all levels and to take appropriate steps to make education accessible to all.

This national commitment is echoed and expanded within the Bangsamoro Organic Law (Republic Act No. 11054). Section 13, Article IX affirms the responsibility of the Bangsamoro Government to provide, maintain, and ensure the delivery of quality education and other essential services to the people of the region.

Further, Section 16, Article IX of the BOL underscores the Bangsamoro Government’s duty to establish, maintain, and support a complete and integrated system of quality education—one that is responsive to the ideals, values, and aspirations of the Bangsamoro people and aligned with national education standards.

Moreover, Section 24, Article IX highlights the imperative to preserve the history, culture, arts, traditions, and rich cultural heritage of the Bangsamoro people and their Sultanates, such as those of Sulu, Maguindanao, Kabuntalan, Buayan, the Royal House of Ranao and of the Iranun, and the non-Moro Indigenous Peoples of the region.

Understanding the history of the Bangsamoro people—particularly the long struggle for self-determination—is essential to comprehending the identity, resilience, and current condition of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). This history reflects the people’s resistance to colonization, the assertion of their distinct political and cultural identity, and their enduring pursuit of peace and autonomy.

As such, the integration of Bangsamoro history into the secondary education curriculum is not merely an academic initiative—it is a step toward empowering future generations with a deeper appreciation of their heritage. It fosters critical awareness, reconciliation, and unity by providing the historical context necessary for understanding present-day realities and shaping a more peaceful and inclusive future.

Education serves as a powerful tool in preserving history. By mandating the inclusion of Bangsamoro history in all public and private secondary schools across the region, we ensure that the narratives of the Bangsamoro people are rightfully recognized, taught, and passed on to future generations. This initiative will also inspire the youth to take an active role in the continued growth, leadership, and development of the Bangsamoro region.

In view of the foregoing, the immediate passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
