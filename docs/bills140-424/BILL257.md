**“AN ACT CREATING AND ESTABLISHING A LEVEL 1 GENERAL HOSPITAL TO BE KNOWN AS ALEEM ABDULAZIS S. MIMBANTAS MEMORIAL HOSPITAL IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF MASIU, PROVINCE OF LANAO DEL SUR AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES”**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Republic Act No. 11054, “The Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao” mandates this government to adopt a policy on health that provides for a comprehensive and integrated health service delivery for its constituents. It shall establish by law a general hospital system to serve the requirements of its people to ensure that the individual basic right to life shall be attainable through the prompt intervention of excellent and affordable medical services.

Needless to state, Bangsamoro people shall have access to basic, quality, and affordable medical services. One way to achieve this is by establishing general hospitals in strategic areas like the municipality of Masiu in Lanao Del Sur province.

Currently, patients in the Lanao Sur province, including those from Masiu and neighboring municipalities, have to travel to Marawi City for medical consultations or hospitalization. The travel from Masiu to Marawi City takes approximately an hour and thirty minutes, or even longer from remote barangays. Delays caused by frequent road constructions on the highway can further prolong the travel time. As a result, due to the distance and financial limitations, some patients choose not to seek medical care at all.

Besides improving public health, it is also an urgent need to establish a general hospital to bring economic benefits as well. Additionally, the hospital shall be named as the Aleem Abdulazis S. Mimbantas Memorial Hospital in honor of the memory of Aleem Abdulazis S. Mimbantas who had been the Vice Chairman for Military Affairs of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). His contribution in the struggle of Bangsamoro to self-determination greatly contributed to what we are reaping today. He untiringly advocated the signing of the peace agreement between the MILF and the national government primarily for the welfare and development of Muslims in Mindanao.

Thus, in view of the foregoing, passage of this Bill is earnestly sought.
