**AN ACT**
**STRENGTHENING AND INSTITUTIONALIZING THE “BRIGADA ESKWELA PROGRAM” IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**Explanatory Note**

Section I, Article XIV of the 1987 Constitution states that the State shall protect and promote the right of all citizens to quality education at all levels and shall take appropriate steps to make such education accessible to all.

Section 16, Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), provides that it shall be a top priority of the Bangsamoro Government to establish, maintain, and support a complete and integrated system of quality education, which shall be a subsystem of the national education system. The Bangsamoro Government shall develop an educational framework relevant and responsive to the needs, ideals, and aspirations of the Bangsamoro people. For this purpose, the Bangsamoro Government shall conform to the minimum standards set by the National Government.

Pursuant to DepEd Order (DO) 24, s. 2008, or the Institutionalizing of the Brigada Eskwela Program, all public schools are directed to “engage all stakeholders to contribute their time, efforts, and resources in ensuring that public schools are all set in time for class opening”. The program appeals to the spirit of *Bayanihan* within private institutions, private individuals, government, and non-government organizations to work hand in hand to ensure that the Department of Education (DepEd) will realize its mission of protecting and promoting the right of every Filipino to quality, equitable, culture-based, and complete basic education.

*Brigada Eskwela* is a school maintenance program conducted nationwide that engages all education stakeholders to contribute their time, efforts, and resources in ensuring that public schools are all set in time for class opening. It is a week-long event where local communities, parents, alumni, civic groups, local businesses, NGOs, private individuals and even teachers and students volunteer their time, skills to do minor to medium repairs and other maintenance work in schools. Volunteers are often motivated to perform such acts by values such as justice, equality, and freedom as expressed in the United Nations Charter. By and large, a society which supports and encourages different forms of volunteering is likely to be a society which also promotes the well-being of its citizens.

The United Nations Volunteers (UNV) advocates the power of volunteerism. People all over the over engage in volunteerism for a great variety of reasons: to help to eliminate poverty and to improve basic health and education, to tackle environmental issues, to reduce the risk of disasters or to combat social exclusion and violent conflict. In all of these fields, volunteerism makes a specific contribution by generating well-being for people and their communities. Volunteers are motivated by values like those of justice, equality and freedom as expressed in the United Nations Charter. A society which supports and encourages different forms of volunteering is likely to be a society which also promotes the well-being of its citizens.

This bill, which aims to strengthen and institutionalize Brigada Eskwela Program in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, can help foster understanding to all the sectors of our society that the education of the youth is not only the sole responsibility of the government but, it is the responsibility of everyone. The cooperation of everyone, through inculcating a sense of shared responsibility, is vital to the developing success of every Bangsamoro youth. A mandate of everyone’s participation in the implementation of this program can inevitably help provide the pupils and students with a not only a maintained and prepared classroom, but also a clean and conducive learning environment just in time for their first day of classes.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
