**Explanatory Note**

Under the 1987 Constitution, “*The State shall afford full protection to labor, local and overseas, organized and unorganized, and promote full employment and equality of employment opportunities for all.*” (Section 3, Article XIII).

It is stated in Section 3, Article V of Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the promotion of health and safety.

Moreover, Section 23, Article XIII of the BOL provides that with the policies and laws of Bangsamoro Government on agriculture as a key development strategy, it shall promote productivity measures, and provide support for small farmers, landholders and marginal fisherfolk.

The Bangsamoro Region in Muslim Mindanao offers a variety of agricultural potential due to its abundant natural resources and favorable landscape. Today, regional linkages and other non-governmental groups have focused on rural productivity and sustainable income-generating projects to aid former combatants cope and adapt with the shifting environment brought about by the region's official establishment.² The region's seascape, particularly in the southernmost area, makes the fishing industry equally important in advancing the economic growth of the region due to its potential.

A fundamental truth is clear: economic growth is a crucial aspect of development for countries, but it must not come at the expense of the individuals contributing to it. When agri-fishery workers receive meager wages, must endure long hours in hazardous environments, and are denied essential benefits, these circumstances are all unjust and unsustainable. In perspective, the primary objective of economic development should be enhancing the well-being of agri-fishery workers, enabling them to work out of capability rather than obligation.

By granting farmers and fisherfolks access to social protection initiatives, including income support, crop insurance, health coverage, microfinance opportunities, and educational and training programs, the region can enhance their livelihoods, reduce their vulnerability to risks, and foster inclusive economic growth. This, in turn, would significantly expand the avenues for improved agriculture and fish production.

In a study conducted in 2021, it was highlighted that the downturn in the agricultural sector can be attributed to the government's inability to safeguard the welfare of domestic farmers, where other focuses such as globalization and commercialization were prioritized instead.³ Overall, the same situation is observed within the fishing industry. Towards this end, passing a law that provides for a comprehensive social protection program for the agri-fishery workers in the region is a significant step in responding to the needs of this sector. With the above-stated intents, the approval of this bill is urgently sought.
