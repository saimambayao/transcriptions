**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Waqf is one of the great acts of charity in Islam. Literally meaning "to preserve, stand and/or to hold", it is a continuous, ongoing philanthropy. It has been mentioned in the Hadith of Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) that "When the son of Adam dies, his deeds come to an end, except for three things: ongoing charity (sadaqatul jariya), knowledge (by which people benefit), and a righteous child who prays for him." Indeed, in the Islamic world, ongoing or perpetual charity, has found its manifestation on what we now know as waqf.

In Islam, waqf means a religious endowment or a voluntary and irrevocable dedication of a portion of one's wealth and its disbursements for religious or charitable purposes that are aligned with the Shari'ah. Waqf property covers both the income-generating property and the proceeds thereof which are to be used to fund pious and charitable activities, including, but not limited to construction of mosques, madrasahs, hospitals and other facilities of similar nature.

Historically, waqf have played a major role in providing sustainable finance for many social services, including but not limited to education and health. In fact, it has been estimated that during the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates, more than 60 percent of public services were carried out via the institution of waqf. First, waqf financed the basic social services (and infrastructure) of education and health as well as sustenance or social security for the needy. Second, beyond these basic needs, waqf played an important role in the development of cultural and scientific life as they financed the production of books, the construction of libraries, as well as supporting scholars of various religious and secular sciences.

The Bangsamoro is not a stranger on the different waqf arrangements. Anecdotal evidence points to mosques, madrasahs, and other structures that are standing on waqf land. However, these arrangements are informal in nature. We have no data on the actual number of waqf that has been established in the BARMM and in the Philippines and the properties covered by waqf. And we do not know oftentimes to what extent the waqf founder's intentions have been realized in the length of time that the waqf has been in operation. There is no central governing body that monitors and provides support to the waqfs. This is quite understandable, given that there is no public policy framework that governs waqf in the Bangsamoro or in the Philippines.

A legislative and policy framework on waqf would formalize the various waqf arrangements in the Bangsamoro, and provide the much-needed support to parties involved in waqf – such as the founder (waqif), the waqf managers and trustee/s (mutawalli or nadhir); ensure accountability especially in the realization of the aims of the waqf; and protect the interests of the beneficiaries – whether an identified group of people or the general public. This in turn, is envisioned to encourage individuals in the Bangsamoro to establish waqf.

Under Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law, the Bangsamoro Parliament shall have the power to enact laws to promote, protect and ensure the general welfare of the Bangsamoro and other inhabitants in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. Similarly, under Article V, Section 2 (ii) thereof, the Bangsamoro Government is empowered to exercise authority over Islamic banking and finance. This is not only limited to the Islamic equivalents of conventional financial products, but also social finance such as waqf, zakat and others.

Thus, this proposed bill seeks to encourage the establishment of waqf to benefit the widest number of our constituents, especially those who are poor, vulnerable and disadvantaged, and those who seek a more robust spiritual life. A Bangsamoro Waqf Commission in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) which will serve as a regulatory body that will provide the necessary mechanisms to regulate the establishment and administration of waqf, subject to the rules of Shariah and Islamic principles. Given the noble objectives of the institution of waqf, it is imperative that a system be established to protect not only the parties but the property (awqaf) and the objectives (maqasid) of the waqf itself.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
