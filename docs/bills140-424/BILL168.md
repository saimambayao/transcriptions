**AN ACT ESTABLISHING THE SPECIAL MADRASAH FUND TO PROVIDE SUSTAINABLE FINANCIAL SURGES FOR THE REINVENTION, PILOT TESTING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF QUALITY AND COMPETITIVE BALANCED BASIC MADRASAH EDUCATION CURRICULA IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

This bill seeks to establish funds for the review, redesign, pilot testing and enhancement of the basic madrasah curricula from Grade 1 to Senior High School in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region; and eventually, anticipate that these enhanced curricula would bring in quality and competitive education to the Bangsamoro children and youths --- the education that would stabilize the competence of these young learners in pursuit of their righteous struggle for well-off survival in this material world and the Hereafter;

Operationally, the proposed measure attempts to establish and sustain basic madrasah education curricula that are “interactively balanced for spiritual and worldly development of the learners” --- that is, for the righteous struggle of these learners in this material world and the hereafter. Thus, these curricula are expected to:

(a) bring the learners into learning environments where they can acquire the desired Islamic knowledge and learning competencies that will transform them into faithfully practicing Islam, socially and economically competitive, and politically vibrant in pursuit of institutionalizing just coexistence and sustainable development in the community;

(b) promote modernization, but limited only to moving the learners from merely memorizing facts, rules and procedures to developing their broader range of higher-order skills to solve problems and think creatively based on scientific approach and logic, which are in conformity with the Islamic thoughts, values and practices in order to guarantee both the spirituality and competitiveness of the learners in this material world and the hereafter;

(c) vouch for the integration of the core subjects of the mainstream basic education, but these subjects should be deeply contextualized; and

(d) guarantee parallelism with, if not superiority to the ones prescribed by the Department of Education (DepEd) to the standard madaris, in terms of their learning stands and competencies.

Actualizing the foregoing expectations would make the madrasah a powerful learning hub for the learners to become productive citizens; and, a mechanism to establish the potentiality that DepEd would recognize and accredit the madrasah as Standard Muslim Education Institution (SMEI), and consequently issue the Learning Accreditation and Equivalency (LAE) certificate to completers of this madrasah with criteria to be set by the DepEd in collaboration with the Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education (MBHTE) of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

The LAE is the ultimate goal of the proposed measure to make possible the smooth transition of learners from the Madrasah education system to the education system of the State should they or any of them wish to transfer; or, the elementary and high school completers of the madrasah to use this LAE certificate when they opt to enroll in higher appropriate level of the State’s education system; or use the certificate as valid and acceptable document to represent their educational qualification for jobs that require elementary or secondary graduate diploma.

In Islam, a Muslim’s life in this material world and the hereafter should be tightly connected through a sound insight in having all-embracing way of life. Surah 28 (Al-Qasas), Ayah 77 of the Holy Qur’an reads in English translation, “But seek, through that which Allah has given you, the home of the Hereafter; and (yet), do not forget your share of the world. And do good as Allah has done good to you. And desire not corruption in the land. Indeed, Allah does not like corrupters” (Sahih International). In support to this Ayah, a prophetic tradition of the messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, verbalizes “He is not from us who gives up his worldly life in favor of his Hereafter, nor is he who gives up his Hereafter in favor of his worldly life.”

In allusion to the foregoing, the madrasah curricula should be balanced both in spirit and application in this material world, and sensitive to the Bangsamoro Islamic culture. However, this idealistic view is non-existing as, except for their being sensitive to Islamic tenets and culture, no madrasah in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region and the rest of the Muslim communities in the Philippines is offering a completely balanced and functional basic education program.

Indeed, while there are madaris (plural of madrasah) recognized and accredited by the DepEd under the category of “Standard Private Madrasah (SPM)”, it is simply by adding the Department’s five (5) core subjects for elementary levels (Grades 1 to 6 only) that include Science, Math, English, Filipino and Makabayan to the Madrasah’s subjects on Qur’an, Seerah (biography), Hadith (Sayings of the Prophet), Aqueedah (conduct), Fiqh (jurisprudence), and Arabic language to make the curricula appear to be balanced. Some professionals already consider this initiative as balanced education, which is still far from the contextual substance of the word. Also, this initiative manifests the reign of information overload on the learners. Thus, there is a need to explore the possibility of reducing the subjects by merging related ones.

Legality-wise, the proposed measure is guided by the Philippine Constitution as stipulated in Article XIV (Education, Science and Technology, Arts, Culture and Sports) and the provisions under it, particularly in Section 1 - Mandate of the State to recognize and protect the right of the citizens to quality education; and Section 2(1) - Support of the State to integrated education system relevant to the needs of the people and society. It is also inspired by Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law, particularly in Section 16, which mandates the Bangsamoro government to prioritize the establishment, maintenance and support to a complete and integrated system of quality education.

The proposed measure is, Insha Allah, the answer to the provision of balanced, functional, integrated, sustainable, quality and competitive basic madrasah education for the Muslim youths in the Bangsamoro region --- the curricula that advocate unity in diversity and modernization of learning in accordance with Islamic thoughts, and in allusion to the education standards of the State.

With the foregoing conclusive anticipations of the proposed measure, the Bangsamoro can create an education system and curricula that the Bangsamoro government and constituents can comfortably and confidently claim OWNERSHIP, in consideration of the curricula’s uniqueness, independence but respectful to diversity, and competitiveness in terms of learning competencies needed by the learners to make themselves productive in their respective worlds of work, and the spiritual knowledge and practices that will bolster their life in the hereafter. Hence, the full support of the Bangsamoro Parliament is earnestly sought.
