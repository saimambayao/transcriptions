**AN ACT GRANTING CASH INCENTIVES TO BANGSAMORO ATHLETES IN NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL SPORTS COMPETITIONS, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: “The strong (active) believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer, while there is good in both.” The Prophet himself participated in swimming, archery, running, and horseback riding and was said to have encouraged parents to involve their children in these sports.

In 1928, the ninth Olympiad was held in Amsterdam, Netherlands, where the first Muslim Olympian by the name of Tuburan Kontong Tamse, a 17-year-old Sulu native, represented and brought honor and glory not only to the Bangsamoro people but to every tongue chanting and praising the Philippine flag, in the swimming competition. This feat of a young Tausog is a testament to how sports-loving the Bangsamoro people were.

With the development in sports both locally and internationally, many of our Bangsamoro athletes are inspired to follow in the footsteps of Mr. Tamse. Many have emerged as champions in various fields of sports, giving pride and honor to the country and the Bangsamoro Community, which deserves the utmost commendation from the Bangsamoro Government and its people.

During the recent conduct of the Southeast Asian Games at Phnom Penh, Cambodia, from May 5-17, 2023, three (3) Bangsamoro athletes excelled in different sports events and won medals, which have been afforded due recognition by this parliament via resolutions. They are Ms. Fatimah Ayesha Amirul, who won Gold Medal in Women’s soft tennis, Mr. Alnakran Abdilla, who won a bronze medal in Men’s Beach Volleyball and Mr. Denmark Abdurasad, also grabbed the bronze medal in the Men’s Tanding class D (60-65 kilograms.

However, before any medal or trophies these athletes receive in every sport they participate in, they have undergone intense, nerve-wracking, grueling, and thorough training for years. The dedication and determination they pour in during their training to give us honor and glory are certainly astounding and extraordinary. Perhaps there are more ways to acknowledge and reward their tears and sweat than to give them mere applause and medals. It is important to provide our athletes proper recognition through a system of rewards for their outstanding achievements by including the giving of financial assistance to them, which is the subject matter of this bill.

According to research, Money has frequently been used as an extrinsic motivator since it is assumed that humans are willing to invest more effort for financial reward. The level and amount of effort in a person will either increase or decrease on the basis of the quality of incentives offered to the person.

Hence, to better provide due and proper recognition to our Bangsamoro athletes, it is earnestly sought that this bill granting cash incentives be passed and approved.
