**AN ACT**
**PROVIDING ONE-TIME DEATH BENEFITS TO THE FAMILIES OF BANGSAMORO ISLAMIC ARMED FORCES (BIAF) SHAHEED, ESTABLISHING THE BIAF SHAHEED BENEFIT INVESTMENT FUND, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**Explanatory Note**

The Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces (BIAF) played a pivotal role in the decades-long armed struggle for self-determination, justice, and peace in the Bangsamoro. Many of BIAF fighters made the ultimate sacrifice in pursuit of these aspirations. Their legacy is etched into the very foundations of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), and their families continue to bear the weight of that sacrifice.

This proposed measure seeks to institutionalize a one-time death benefit for the families of BIAF Shaheed, as a tangible expression of the Bangsamoro Government’s recognition and gratitude. It also establishes the BIAF Shaheed Benefit Investment Fund (BSBIF), a sustainable mechanism to ensure the long-term viability of the program through Shariah-compliant investments.

By providing structured financial assistance and honoring the memory of those who gave their lives for the Bangsamoro cause, this bill affirms our collective commitment to justice, historical reconciliation, and inclusive development.

Approval of this measure is earnestly sought.

Respectfully submitted,

**ATTY. KITEM D. KADATUAN**
Member of Parliament
