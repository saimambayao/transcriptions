**“AN ACT TO UPGRADE THE EXISTING DATU ODIN SINSUAT DISTRICT HOSPITAL IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF DATU ODIN SINSUAT, PROVINCE OF MAGUINDANAO FROM ITS PRESENT STATUS WITH A FIFTY (50) BED CAPACITY INTO ONE HUNDRED (100) BED CAPACITY, ITS FACILITIES AND PROFESSIONAL HEALTH CARE, AUTHORIZING THE INCREASE OF ITS MEDICAL PERSONNEL, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES”**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The creation of this Proposed BTA Parliament bill is in furtherance of timely appropriation, comprehensive implementation and full compliance of the adopted Republic Act No. 11330 entitled “ AN ACT CONVERTING THE DINAIG MUNICIPAL HOSPITAL IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF DATU ODIN SINSUAT PROVINCE OF MAGUINDANAO, INTO A FIFTY (50) BED CAPACITY DISTRICT HOSPITAL TO BE KNOWN AS THE DATU ODIN SINSUAT DISTRICT HOSPITAL, UPGRADING ITS FACILITIES AND PROFESSIONAL HEALTH CARE, AUTHORIZING THE INCREASE OF ITS MEDICAL PERSONNEL, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR” signed and approved by no less than the President of the Philippines, Rodrigo Roa Duterte on April 2019.

Upon inquiry with the hospital’s Officer in charge - Chief Nurse, Laboratory Supervisor, Housekeeping Supervisor and Admin Assistant as of the year 2022, it was found out that, even though the hospital has indeed implemented the 50-bed capacity required by Republic Act 11330, the funds that were appropriated and transferred to the abovementioned hospital were only for that of a 10-bed capacity budget since its adoption. Needless to say, therefore, that other requirements that need serious attention and urgent compliance such as the pertinent facilities, equipment, additional professional medical staff and increase in medical personnel which are imperative for the proper operation of the hospital are not complied with. With the outnumbered professional medical staff and medical personnel, patients are deemed deprived of their right to proper medical attention and intervention for quick response to their recovery and recuperation. The lives of the patients are in apparent peril and jeopardy for the obvious reason. Another dilemma of the hospital is the uncomplimentary structure of its building to cater 50-bed capacity. It is worth mentioning that the structure of the hospital was built for level-1 status or only for 10-bed capacity thus, this Proposed BTA Parliament Bill also intends to include appropriation of funds for the construction and renovation of the said hospital for its expansion into a one hundred (100) bed capacity.

Among nearby municipalities in Maguindanao, statistical records would show that the highest population became the impetus and the assessment of the need for the rising of the Datu Odin Sinsuat (DOS) District Hospital. Since then, the hospital has become the referring unit, a detachment from the nearby municipalities, and from time to time catered a wide number of cases and patients from different nearby municipalities. Furthermore, prior to COVID-19 pandemic, DOS District Hospital catered more than the 50-bed capacity limit; we can only imagine the patients crowding in the lobby of the hospital with their watchers sleeping on the floor.

In Section 2 paragraph 2 of Article IX of R.A. 11054 otherwise known as the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, “the Bangsamoro Government shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. It shall also uphold the peoples’ right to have access to essential goods, health, and other social services that promote their well-being. The Parliament shall enact appropriate legislation towards this end.

The Bangsamoro Government is mandated to create and implement legislation that would benefit the Bangsamoro People and the general Public. Thus, this proposed BTA Parliament bill for the expansion of the DOS District Hospital into 100-bed capacity.
