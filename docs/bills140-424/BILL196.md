**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Holidays are observed to allow individuals or various groups around the world to celebrate and/or commemorate a historical event or tradition of cultural or religious significance. In as far as workers are concerned, holidays mean non-working days.

The rich cultural heritage of the Bangsamoro people must be preserved and enriched where a number of significant historical events and heroes worth commemorating should be given tribute and honored.

On September 12, 1973, *Presidential Decree No. 291* was enacted recognizing Muslim holidays to be officially observed and be part of national holidays in the country although the approximate dates may be determined in accordance with the Muslim Lunar Calendar or appearance of the moon or upon Islamic astronomical calculations, whichever is possible or convenient, in accordance to section 4 of the said Decree. To supplement this, on November 24, 1992, the defunct ARMM issued *Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act No. 17* (MMAA No. 17) otherwise known as “An Act Recognizing Muslim Historical and Religious Events and All Existing Muslim Holidays in the ARMM and for Other Purposes”.

When a plebiscite was held ratifying the Bangsamoro Organic Law and the establishment of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Government was in motion, January 21, 2019 was declared as the Bangsamoro Foundation Day as provided for in the *Bansamoro Autonomy Act No. 13* otherwise known as Bangsamoro Administrative Code.

As one of the Transitional Justice Mechanisms, on February 19, 2020, nearly a month before the 52nd anniversary of Jabidah Massacre, the Bangsamoro Parliament adopted *Resolution No. 62* dated February 19, 2020 requiring all the ministries and offices including schools to initiate and develop comprehensive policies, programs and activities every March 18 in commemoration of the same.

For this purpose, this Bill commemorates the events of religious significance and cultural identities, and honors the heroism of the Bangsamoro who lost their lives in the fight for aspiration for self-identity and determination.

The recognitions of religious, historical and/or cultural significance, the value of Hijra calendar, the holiday economics, the pretransmission of holidays, master list of existing special local holidays in the respective Local Government Units (LGUs), will be the key features of this Bill.

It is therefore just fitting to give recognition that the Bangsamoro truly deserves, the passage of this proposed measure is earnestly sought.
