**AN ACT ESTABLISHING A SUPPLEMENTAL ACADEMIC LEARNING AMELIORATION PROGRAM (SALAP) FOR DISADVANTAGED LEARNERS, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Many studies point out the fact that the students in our region performed the least in almost all the required competencies, especially in Language, Science, and Mathematics.

The Key Findings of the Basic Education Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (BE-PEIR) conducted in 2013 are undeniable:

"ARMM suffers from extremely poor education outcomes (Chapter 2). Enrollment, completion, and attainment rates for elementary education lag behind most regions in the Philippines. These outcomes perpetuate "poverty traps" and decrease the prospects of children in the region enjoying better living standards and attaining secure employment.

From 2011-12, only 23 percent of students in Grade 1 made it to Grade 6 against a national average of 73.5 percent. At the secondary level, around 45 percent of 1st Year students continued studying until 4th year, whereas the national average was 78.8 percent. In other terms, only 1 out of every ten students who began primary education in ARMM will graduate from high school.

Such low completion rates decrease the efficiency of a given level of education inputs, amplifying the impact of problems in the public expenditure management system. Due to the attrition of students leaving the system, it takes 32 percent more spending and effort to produce a single high school graduate in ARMM than elsewhere in the Philippines, and twice the effort to produce a Grade Six graduate in ARMM as elsewhere."

It proceeds to further say that:

"Those who graduate from high school find it difficult to continue in tertiary education due to a combination of factors, including poverty. Only 11.5 percent of females and 9.2 percent of males in ARNIM are likely to have some college education, compared with the national averages of 22.4 percent for females and 19.0 percent for males."

To further illustrate, if we had 1,000 grade 1 students in School Year 2013, only 100 would graduate from secondary school. Of these 100, only 20 (11 female and 9 male) will have some kind of college education.

Aside from poverty, among the dominant factors for the steady increase in our dropouts, which in the 2016 report of the PSA was at 14%, is due to lack of interest in pursuing their basic education.

Accordingly, the pandemic has exacerbated well-documented opportunity gaps that put low-income students at a disadvantage, in comparison to their better-off peers, due to a lack of access to learning resources.

This proposed bill is intended to improve the learning competencies of our students and boost their confidence to transition from one grade level to another. Unless we are able to do this, we can never truly say that we have quality education in the region.

The supplemental academic learning program will be a remedial measure for disadvantaged students to become more confident to transition to the next education level and, hopefully, the wherewithal to finish college.

In view of the foregoing, this representation is seeking for the early passage of this bill into law.

It is the declared policy of the Region to protect and promote the right of all its residents to quality education at all levels and shall take appropriate steps to make such education accessible to all. Towards this end, the Region shall endeavor to support learners by establishing a free and effective supplemental learning program to provide disadvantaged learners with supplemental lessons to close learning gaps and enable them to catch up to their cohorts.

**SECTION 4. Establishment of the Supplemental Academic Learning Amelioration Program** - The Supplemental Academic Learning Amelioration Program (SALAP) is hereby established to provide a regional learning intervention program that shall be grounded on the following areas:

(a) Well-systematized tutorial sessions, which demonstrate higher achievement gains;
(b) Well-designed remediation plans tailored-fit to the learning needs of learners;
(c) Careful assessment and evaluation of the progress of learners; and
(d) Well-chosen and trained remedial instruction facilitators;

The program shall further ensure that learners shall be provided with optimal instructional time to ensure mastery of essential competencies and adequately prepare them for higher grade levels.

**SECTION 5. Most Essential Learning Competencies in Language, Mathematics, and Science.** - The Supplemental Academic Learning Amelioration Program (SALAP) shall cover the most essential learning competencies under the K to 12 Basic Education Curriculum covering the subjects of Language and Mathematics for Grades 1 to 12, Science for Grades 3 to 12.

Reading, which is included in the most essential learning competencies in Language, shall be prioritized to develop the critical and analytical thinking skills of learners.
For Kindergarten learners, the Program shall focus on building foundational skills aimed at strengthening their literacy and numeracy competencies.

**SECTION 6. Determination of Learners under the Program.** - The MBHTE, through the school principal and in consultation with the advisory or classroom teachers, shall determine the learners to be covered by this program using its Learner Information System (LIS) and other relevant databases.
