**AN ACT**
**ESTABLISHING THE BANGSAMORO STATE UNIVERSITY IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM), APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**Explanatory Note**

Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that, “*Everyone has the right to education.*”

Under the 1987 Constitution, “*The State shall protect and promote the rights of all citizens to quality education at all levels and shall take appropriate steps to make such education accessible to all*” (Section 1, Article XIV).

This is also reiterated in Section 13, Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), which states: “*The Bangsamoro Government shall provide, maintain, and ensure the delivery of basic and responsive health programs, quality education, appropriate services, livelihood opportunities, affordable and progressive housing projects, power and electricity, and water to the inhabitants of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.*” Also enshrined in the BOL is the priority of the Bangsamoro Government to establish, maintain, and support a complete and integrated system of quality education, which shall be a subsystem of the national education system. The Bangsamoro Government shall develop an educational framework relevant and responsive to the needs, ideals, and aspirations of the Bangsamoro people. For this purpose, the Bangsamoro Government shall conform to the minimum standards set by the National Government (Section 16, Article IX).

Every Bangsamoro must have easy access to quality education. The Bangsamoro Government must ensure that every child, most especially the marginalized, the disadvantaged, and those living in remote and poverty-stricken areas—has equal and equitable opportunities for education, regardless of their social class, race, gender and ethnic background.

Education is a catalyst for the growth and development of society. According to the 2016 World Economic Forum (WEF), education increases the efficiency of each individual worker and helps economies move up the value chain beyond manual tasks or simple production processes. The 2016 WEF suggested three channels through which education affects a country’s productivity. First, it increases the collective ability of the workforce to carry out existing tasks more quickly. Second, secondary and tertiary education especially facilitate the transfer of knowledge about new information, products, and technologies created by others (Barro and Lee 2010). Finally, by increasing creativity it boosts a country’s own capacity to create new knowledge, products, and technologies.¹

Numerous young individuals have been deprived of education due to decades of armed conflict in the region. The lack of education can eventually lead to a high rate of unemployment, especially among those coming from poor families.

Across all levels of formal education, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) consistently had the lowest participation and completion rates among all regions. In 2017, the Net Enrollment Rate (NER) in BARMM fell below the national average by about 20% at the elementary level and 45% at the Junior High School (JHS) level.²

In BARMM, increasingly more students have been able to graduate from elementary schools; however, elementary school completion rate was 54% against a national average of 94% in 2017. At the JHS level, around 62% of Grade 7 students continued to study until Grade 10, where the national average was 85%. In BARMM, the dropout rate per grade worsened from 11% in 2010 to 14% in 2017, which accumulated over the basic education cycle and led to significantly low school completion rates.³

In other terms, only 1 out of every 10 students who begin primary education in BARMM would graduate from lower secondary education on time. Of every 10 children, about 8 would enter Grade 1 on time, but only 5 would complete Grade 6. Of those, 2 might proceed to JHS, and only 1 would complete Grade 10 on time. This leaves nine children for every 10 who are out of school without completing the full basic education cycle. Long-lasting conflicts and violence in BARMM and in its surrounding regions, have deprived children of the opportunity to study in school under stable conditions.⁴

Moreover, based on the findings of the Second Congressional Commission on Education (EDCOM II)⁵ a national commission tasked with evaluating the performance of the Philippine education sector, while higher education participation rate in the country is high at 34.89 percent, this figure remains lower than the ASEAN average of 41.10 percent. This also varies significantly across regions, with BARMM (18.7 percent), Bicol (24.6 percent) and Central Luzon (25.1 percent) having much lower rates. Furthermore, studies find that the top deterrents to pursuing higher education today are employment/looking for work (44.17 percent), lack of personal interest (24.94 percent) and financial limitations (20.98 percent).

Also, according to the same survey, attrition rates are equally alarming. Higher education attrition rates are alarmingly high: at 39 percent nationally but reaching 93.4 percent in BARMM, followed by Region VII (60.7 percent), Region IX (59.5 percent) and CAR (54.9 percent).⁶

In view of the increasing need for a complete and integrated system of education, it is imperative to create a state university that can accommodate the students in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

It is stated in Section 3, Article V of the BOL that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the promotion of health and safety.

In furtherance of the Bangsamoro government’s primordial duty as *parens patriae*, or the guardian of the people’s rights, it is necessary to prioritize the needs of the Bangsamoro students. This includes providing better access to quality education that is responsive to their needs. The establishment of a state university can provide an easy and better access to education and give an opportunity for the students to learn in order to live an improved life that can help their families to integrate into the society and be part in the nation-building.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
