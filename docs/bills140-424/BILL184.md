**AN ACT**
**PROMOTING AGRICULTURAL MICROFINANCE IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION, PROVIDING FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A REGIONAL AGRICULTURAL MICROFINANCE PROGRAM, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Agriculture is a vital sector in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), providing livelihood to about 70% of the region's population. However, small-scale farmers and fisherfolks who comprise the majority of the sector face various challenges that hinder their productivity and income. These challenges include limited access to credit, inadequate infrastructure, insufficient market linkages, and low productivity due to outdated farming practices and climate change. As a result, the region's agricultural sector is underdeveloped and has not realized its full potential.

To address these challenges, this bill proposes the establishment of the Regional Agricultural Microfinance Program, which aims to promote agricultural microfinance in the region. The program seeks to provide small-scale farmers and fisherfolks with access to credit, adequate infrastructure, market linkages, and other support services to boost their farm production and income. The program also aims to promote financial inclusion by reaching out to the unbanked and underserved communities in rural areas.

According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, as of 2020, only 16.5% of the households in BARMM have savings accounts, while 83.5% do not have any form of savings. This indicates the need to improve financial inclusion in the region, particularly in rural areas where most small-scale farmers and fisherfolks reside. By promoting agricultural microfinance, the program can provide financial services that are tailored to the needs of the small-scale farmers and fisherfolks and that can help them improve their productivity and income.

The program will be implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Agrarian Reform (MAFAR) which will be responsible for the management and disbursement of the funds. The program will be financed from various sources, including the Bangsamoro government budget, grants, donations, concessional loans, and loans from commercial banks and other financial institutions. MAFAR shall ensure that the funds are utilized efficiently, effectively, and transparently in accordance with the objectives of the program.

The program will adopt various measures to ensure that the beneficiaries are reached, and the services are delivered to them effectively. These measures include the use of mobile technology and digital platforms for delivering microfinance services to rural communities, the establishment of community-based microfinance institutions, and the conduct of capacity-building programs to enhance the financial management skills of the community leaders and members.

In conclusion, the Regional Agricultural Microfinance Program aims to promote agricultural microfinance in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to address the challenges faced by small-scale farmers and fisherfolks. The program seeks to provide them with access to credit, adequate infrastructure, market linkages, and other support services to boost their farm production and income. The program also aims to promote financial inclusion by reaching out to the unbanked and underserved communities in rural areas. The successful implementation of the program will lead to the development of the region's agricultural sector, improvement of the livelihood of its people, and overall economic growth of the region.

In view of the foregoing, approval of this bill is earnestly sought.
