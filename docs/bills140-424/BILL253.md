**Explanatory Note**

Under the 1987 Constitution, "*the State shall promote a just and dynamic social order that will ensure the prosperity and independence of the nation and free the people from poverty through policies that provide adequate social services, promote full employment, a rising standard of living, and an improved quality of life for all.*" (Section 9, Article II).

Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), states that, "*The Bangsamoro Government shall ensure every Filipino citizen in its territorial jurisdiction the provision of the basic necessities and equal opportunities in life. Social justice shall be promoted in all aspects of life and phases of development in the Bangsamoro Region.*" (Section 7, Article IV).

Republic Act No. 7796, or the Technical Education and Skills Development Act of 1994, provides for the creation of the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA), which replaced and absorbed the National Manpower and Youth Council (NMYC), the Bureau of Technical and Vocational Education (BTVE) and the personnel and functions pertaining to technical-vocational education in the regional offices of the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) and the apprenticeship program of the Bureau of Local Employment of the Department of Labor and Employment.

The TESDA was created and mandated to integrate, coordinate, and monitor skills development programs; restructure efforts to promote and develop middle-level manpower; approve skills standards and tests; develop an accreditation system for institutions involved in middle-level manpower development; and assist trainers training programs.

To carry out this mandate, TESD training centers were established in different parts of the country. The establishment of these centers in the provinces can help Filipinos be equipped with basic practical knowledge and technical expertise, which in turn, transform them into self-reliant, productive, and most importantly, employable within a certain field. Their capacities are enhanced so that they can be more efficient and skilled, as well as become more capable and progressive members of society. In the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, TESDA functions were assimilated by the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education (MBHTE) by virtue of the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act (BAA) No. 13, or the Bangsamoro Administrative Code. However, there are only a few TESD training centers found in the region today, where these centers are noticeably absent in some of the local government units in the BARMM.

To help the constituents by giving them an opportunity to acquire quality education and training without any economic constraint, the establishment of a TESD training center in every municipality is imperative to uplift the lives of every Bangsamoro into transforming them to skilled individuals up to specific standards, and more significantly, make them employable. The establishment of one training center in every municipality/city, as proposed in this measure, can serve the noble purpose of providing every Bangsamoro with basic practical knowledge and technical expertise in their desired area of competency.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
