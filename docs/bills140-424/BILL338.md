Be it enacted by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament in session assembled:

**SEC 2. Declaration of Policy.** - It is the policy of the Bangsamoro Government to promote the rights and welfare of children with Neurodevelopmental Disorder and other special needs, ensuring their access to education, healthcare, and social services.
