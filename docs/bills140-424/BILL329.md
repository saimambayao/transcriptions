**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The proposed bill attempts to regionalize R.A. No. 11966, s. 1991, known as the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Code of the Philippines so that PPP transactions between the Bangsamoro government and private companies can be easier and faster. It can be noted that R.A. No 11966 only covers Local Government Units (LGUs) and does not extend to the BARMM.

The regionalization of R.A. No. 7160, s. 1991, known as the “Local Government Code of the Philippines” with the passage of B.A.A. No. 49, s. 2023, renowned as the “Bangsamoro Local Governance Code” and other regionalized national laws by the Bangsamoro Parliament inspire the proponents to draft the Regional PPP bill.

Similar bill has been previously filed before the Bangsamoro Parliament. However, the bill is patterned after an older PPP framework, and still takes into account the now repealed R.A. No. 6957, s. 1990 - An Act Authorizing the Financing, Construction, Operation and Maintenance of Infrastructure Projects by the Private Sector and for Other Purposes”, as amended by Republic Act No. 7718, s. 1994 or “An Act Amending Certain Sections of R.A. NO. 6957. Nevertheless, the amended law still exclusively allows the LGUs, not Regional Governments like BARMM, to enter into contract arrangements with the private sector to implement infrastructure projects through either of the two (2) variants - Built-Operate-and-Transfer (BOT) or Built-Transfer-and-Operate (BTO).

The introduction of a dedicated Regional PPP Law by the Bangsamoro Government aligns with the objective of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) to establish an autonomous political entity that recognizes the unique identity of the Bangsamoro people, providing them with an opportunity for self-governance. Through this law, the Bangsamoro Government can undertake PPP infrastructure and development Projects aimed at addressing specific economic and socio-cultural needs of the BARMM and its constituents, thereby fulfilling its mandate of self-governance.

A Bangsamoro PPP Law tailored fit for the BARMM ensures that project approval authority will be closely attuned to the requirements of the Bangsamoro people. Projects are designed to address the specific needs of the BARMM, expediting the approval process and eliminating the necessity for endorsement from the national PPP center for local projects.

To provide more, better, affordable, and timely services to the community, facilitate inclusive growth, and promote a better quality of life for the inhabitants of the Bangsamoro region, the Bangsamoro Government must partner with the private sector through PPP arrangements. After all, the Bangsamoro Government has pursued a 12- point Priority Agenda of setting up and implementing programs and projects that will respond to the pressing social and economic challenges in the Bangsamoro Region, such as poverty, education, health, access to clean water and electricity, job opportunity, agricultural productivity, and access to capital market to be complemented with responsive strategic infrastructure in the region such as ports, road network, flood control, and logistics and communication facilities.

The Bangsamoro Government should pursue PPP projects consistent with its infrastructure, investment, environmental, governance and socio-economic development framework through its own enacted policies, plans, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulation.

The legal basis of the proposed bill are the following: (a) *Section 20, Article X of the 1987 Constitution* provides that the organic act of autonomous regions shall provide for legislative powers over, among others, regional urban and rural planning development and such other matters as may be authorized by law for the promotion of the general welfare of the people of the region; (b) *Section 2, Article V of Republic Act (RA) No. 11054* entitled “Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao” empowers the Bangsamoro Government to exercise authority over the following matters, among others, public works and infrastructure; (c) *Section 5, Article VII of RA No. 11054* empowers the Parliament to enact laws to regulate the grant of regional concessions and to promote, protect and ensure the general welfare of the Bangsamoro people and other inhabitants in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. **NOW,** in consideration of the above-cited laws, and with the blessings of the Almighty Allah Sub’hanahu Wa Taala, the Bangsamoro people by the act of the Bangsamoro Parliament wish to ordain and promulgate the following act.

**AN ACT AUTHORIZING AND PROMOTING PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS (PPPs) IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM), ESTABLISHING THE REQUIREMENTS, STANDARDS, AND PROCEDURES THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**Be it enacted by the Bangsamoro Parliament in session assembled:**

**Chapter 1. Basic Principles and Definitions**

**SECTION 1.** *Short Title.* – This Act shall be known as the “BARMM PPP Act.”

**SEC. 2.** *Declaration of Policy.* – The Bangsamoro Government recognizes that PPPs facilitate better, affordable, and timely services to the community, provide inclusive growth, and promote better quality of life for the Bangsamoro people and other inhabitants of BARMM. The Bangsamoro Government, therefore, seeks to foster an enabling environment for PPPs which will pave the way for the private sector to mobilize resources to finance, design, construct, operate, and maintain affordable, accessible, efficient, and sustainable infrastructure and development projects and services within BARMM.

**SEC. 3.** *Operative Principles.* – PPP Projects shall be undertaken in furtherance of BARMM's development framework and shall be an essential part of its overall infrastructure reform policy. Towards this end, the following principles are adopted:

(a) PPP Projects must be feasible and affordable, demonstrating the need for the project, broad level project costs estimation, and indicative commercial viability.

(b) PPP Projects must be bankable. High participation costs, unreasonable risk transfer, or lengthy and complex contract negotiations must be avoided. A cost recovery pricing policy attractive to the private sector must be in place, provided that the same will not be disadvantageous to the government and public interest.

(c) PPP Projects must provide Value-for-Money and good economic value as far as practicable, including allocation of risks to the party best able to control, manage, mitigate, or insure these risks, and maximization of the benefits of private sector efficiency, expertise, flexibility, and innovation.

(d) PPP Projects must provide economic and social benefits and should be evaluated on this basis rather than on purely financial considerations. PPP Projects should give consideration for empowerment of the Bangsamoro people and other inhabitants of BARMM, as a strategy for economic growth and sustainability and must thus provide for the participation of local investors to the furthest extent practicable given the nature of the project. The Bangsamoro Government shall also ensure the hiring and employment of local labor in the PPP venture.

(e) Procurement of PPP Projects must be competitive and must be undertaken through open competitive bidding. Competition must be legitimate, fair, and honest. In the field of government contract law, competition requires not only bidding upon a common standard, a common basis, upon the same thing, the same subject matter, the same undertaking, but also that it be legitimate, fair, and honest; and not designed to injure or defraud the government. Where competitive bidding cannot be applied, a competitive process ensuring both transparency and economically efficient outcome must be employed.

(f) A duly executed and legal PPP Contract shall be respected and not impaired and shall be binding on the successor administration pursuant to the provision on corporate succession. Procedures, activities, and steps duly undertaken by the Chief Minister, the Bangsamoro Economic Development Council (“BEDC”), and the PPP Selection Committee (“PPP-SC”) pursuant to this Act, shall be continued by the successor administration. Any amendment or revision to this Act by the next administration shall not in any way prejudice vested and contractual rights of the government and the Private Partner as to the substance of agreements signed, certifications issued, resolutions issued, and procedures undertaken.

(2) Decision to process or reject – Upon determination of completeness of the Unsolicited Proposal, the PPP-SC may continue processing the Unsolicited Proposal or reject the proposal on the basis of the PPP-SC’s preliminary evaluation that the Unsolicited Proposal is not aligned with the development plans of the Bangsamoro Government or if the Bangsamoro Government is already developing a project with similar scope and/or similar objective. In either case, the Bangsamoro Government shall state in writing with corresponding justification the action it decides to take on the Unsolicited Proposal. The decision of the Bangsamoro Government on the Unsolicited Proposal shall be final and non-appealable.

(3) Detailed Evaluation of an Unsolicited Proposal and of the Qualifications of the Private Proponent — If the PPP-SC decides to continue processing an Unsolicited Proposal, it shall complete a detailed evaluation of the Unsolicited Proposal or similar proposals, and of the qualifications of the Private Proponent/s, within thirty (30) calendar days. After such detailed evaluation, the PPP-SC may:

(i) Accept the proposal and proceed to negotiation pursuant to Subsection 4 of this Section: *Provided*, That in case there are more than one (1) complete Unsolicited Proposal for the same or similar project, the PPP-SC shall determine the most advantageous proposal for the government and the public among the submitted proposals, considering, among others, economic and financial viability of the project, proposed project scope and terms, investment recovery scheme, risks proposed to be assumed by the government, and the qualifications of the Private Proponent: *Provided, further*, That other Private Proponents shall have the opportunity to submit a comparative proposal during the comparative challenge period; or

(ii) Reject the Unsolicited Proposal or all similar proposals in writing with the corresponding justification.

The decision of the PPP-SC shall be communicated to the Private Proponent/s in writing no later than three (3) calendar days from the end of the detailed evaluation period. Such decision by the PPP-SC following the conclusion of the detailed evaluation shall be final and non-appealable.

(4) Negotiation — The PPP-SC and the Private Proponent of the accepted Unsolicited Proposal shall negotiate the PTCs of the proposed PPP Project in good faith: *Provided*, That such negotiations shall conclude within a period not exceeding sixty (60) calendar days, unless extended based on compelling reasons.
