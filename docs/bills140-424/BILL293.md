**AN ACT**
**PROVIDING FINANCIAL AID FOR MEDICATION MAINTENANCE OF SENIOR CITIZENS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law, mandates the Bangsamoro Government to provide, maintain, and ensure the delivery of basic and responsive health programs to its constituents. This includes the protection and promotion of the right to health of senior citizens who have contributed significantly to our region’s growth and development over the years.

In recognition of their invaluable role and endeavors to ensure that they can enjoy their advanced years with dignity and good health, this Author proposes to introduce into law a measure to establish a comprehensive support system to alleviate the financial burden on senior citizens in meeting the costs of their necessary maintenance medications.

The elderly population, particularly senior citizens, often faces the challenge of managing healthcare costs, specifically the expenses associated with maintenance medications crucial for their well-being.

Thus, by providing monthly financial aid, the measure aims to enhance the quality of life for our elderly population, promoting their overall health and longevity.

We believe that this measure is a crucial step towards fulfilling our responsibility to safeguard the health and well-being of the senior members of our community. By addressing the financial barriers associated with medication costs, this act aims to contribute to an improved and healthier life for our elderly citizens.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
