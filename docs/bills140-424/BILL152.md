**AN ACT**
**CREATING THE MINISTRY OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY, ESTABLISHING ITS POWERS AND JURISDICTION, PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**Explanatory Note**

Section 24, Article II of the 1987 Constitution declares that the State recognizes the vital role of communications and information in nation-building. To implement and institutionalize this state priority, the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) was created under the Administrative Code of 1987 to maintain and expand a viable, efficient, safe, and dependable transportation and communications systems as effective instruments for national recovery and economic progress. Today, the department is facing divergent issues in solving problems relating to both transportation and communications. To cope up with the demands of globalization, and to decrease the DOTC's workload, departments should ideally be directed to prioritize and focus on only one or two aspects.

The Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) was then created under the Republic Act No. 10844, otherwise known as the “Department of Information and Communications Technology Act of 2015”, which was then signed into law on May 26, 2016. The DICT is the primary policy, planning, coordinating, implementing, and administrative entity of the executive branch of the government that will plan, develop, and promote the national ICT development agenda. Being a new department in the process of organizing and fulfilling its mandate, the DICT divided its Field Operations Offices (FOO) into clusters composed of regions.

The COVID-19 pandemic drastically affected countries around the world, including the Philippines. The pandemic has highlighted how powerful and helpful the internet is today. People relied on the internet as means of survival as it was the lifeline to those isolated by quarantine and restrictions, by providing real time information in planning and fighting against the virus. It is also a driver of change as the Bangsamoro people were given the opportunity and flexibility to work from home, to learn online, to communicate with family and friends, and to trade goods in e-commerce platforms.

The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is a new political entity created on 2019 by virtue of Republic Act No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL). Its establishment was the culmination of several years of peace talks between the Philippine Government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). The BOL specified that in the exercise of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region's right to self-governance, it is free to pursue its political, economic, social and cultural development. One of the developments that the region needs is the expansion and enhancement of information and communications technology throughout the region.

Currently, the Bangsamoro Region is being served by the Bangsamoro Information and Communications Technology Office (BICTO). The creation of the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology, as proposed in this measure, can better ensure that the communications and technology sector shall be given priority by the Bangsamoro Government. It shall be the primary policy, planning, coordinating, implementing administrative entity that will promote, develop, and regulate integrated and strategic information across communication technology systems and reliable and cost-efficient communication facilities in the Bangsamoro Region.

Thus, to ensure the availability and accessibility of information and communications in areas not adequately served by the private sector, it is but appropriate to create and establish the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology in the BARMM.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
