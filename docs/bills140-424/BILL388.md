**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

**Legal Antecedents**

The right to quality and accessible education is a fundamental right guaranteed by the 1987 Philippine Constitution. *Section 1 of Article XIV* thereof declares that “*The State shall protect and promote the right of all citizens to quality education at all levels, and shall take appropriate steps to make such education accessible to all*”, thus, basic education, through the Department of Education, the main agency tasked to manage and govern the system of basic education, was made mandatory among its citizens, and stringent measures therefor have been put in place to ensure its compliance.

In pursuit of national goals of creating more professionals to foster a society that is scientifically literate and capable of driving innovation and progress, the State recognizes science education to be crucial in achieving so. Crafting policies and educational programs on science and technology have been a priority to guide and promote scientific and technological advancement; one of which was Republic Act 2067, known as the Science Act of 1958, which mandates, among others, the strengthening of educational system of the country for steady source of competent scientific and technological manpower. Concomitantly, the Department of Education, Culture, and Sports had issued DECS Order No. 69 in 1993, encouraging the establishment of Regional Science High Schools all over the country on regional and provincial basis, as expanded under DECS Order number 44, series of 1995, in order to provide an intensive and more advanced secondary education program with special reference to science, and specifically designed for the more intellectually promising students with a prescribed curriculum, set of rules for admission, selective-hiring procedures, among others, distinct from that of regular high schools. And to further motivate and enable them to pursue higher education and training in areas of science, technology, and, as expanded by virtue RA 10612, engineering, the State had even offered scholarships, grants-in-aid, or other forms of incentives to deserving science students and other specially-gifted citizens.

In consonance with the above fundamental right to quality education enshrined in the 1987 Philippine Constitution and other pertinent statutes, the Bangsamoro Organic Law (Republic Act No. 11054), particularly *Article IX, Section 16*, supportively commits upon the Bangsamoro Government the responsibility to provide a complete, adequate, and integrated system of quality education relevant to the inclusive needs of the people in the region. It similarly recognizes in Section 21 of the same Article, science and technology as essential to national and regional progress.

**Purpose of Legislation**

Despite the establishment of one regional science high school in the region, the Amir Bara Lidasan National High School situated in Parang Maguindanao, formerly known as Parang National High School, which was later converted into Regional Science High School in ARMM since 1996, more and more highly promising students across the region, particularly in the island provinces such as Basilan, remain to be enrolled in regular high schools. Due to geographical and financial limitations, the Amir Bara National High School being too distant from their residential province, they find it difficult to cope financially, consequently losing access to and depriving them of the opportunity for advanced intellectual development appropriate to their high level of intelligence. Thus, by institutionalizing the Basilan Science High School, BARMM does not only break geographical barriers, but also creates an advanced educational center for the more intellectually promising students. It will also pave its way to becoming a home to future scientists, innovators, engineers, mathematicians, and even future leaders that will significantly contribute not only to the provincial and regional, but also to the national development in general.

The proposed Lamitan Regional Science High School (LRSHS) shall operate under the direct supervision and control of, and/or regulated by the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education (MBHTE). Therefore, all orders, issuances, and rules and regulations duly promulgated by MBHTE shall be strictly observed and complied with by LRSHS.

To ensure the establishment of the proposed Lamitan Regional Science High School, funding therefor shall be allocated in the annual Bangsamoro General Appropriations Act. This Bill also mandates the Local Government Unit (LGU) of Lamitan City to provide land for the school construction. It also directs the MBHTE, in coordination with relevant agencies and stakeholders, to craft the Implementing Rules and Regulations necessary to carry out the purpose of the Bill.

(Just as the Regional Government acknowledges the importance of providing basic education to all Bangsamoro, with equal weight of importance should it also provide opportunities towards the improvement and development of intellectually gifted and advanced learners by creating an avenue in which their exceptional cognitive abilities are further refined.)

In view of the foregoing, the swift passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
