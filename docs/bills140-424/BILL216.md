**DECLARING THE TOMB OF SULTAN SHARIEFUL HASHIM IN BARANGAY BUANSA, MUNICIPALITY OF INDANAN, PROVINCE OF SULU, A HISTORICAL HERITAGE SITE AND ECOTOURISM DESTINATION, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Bangsamoro is a nation with a rich culture and vibrant history, contributing to the broad spectrum of interest in preserving, protecting, and promoting various sites located in the Bangsamoro Region.

This is in line with the provisions of the 1987 Constitution that provide that the State shall foster the preservation, enrichment, and dynamic evolution of a Filipino culture based on the principle of unity in diversity in a climate of free artistic and intellectual expression. It also mandates the State to conserve, develop, promote, and popularize the nation's historical and cultural heritage and resources, as well as artistic creations. It further provides that all the country's artistic and historic wealth constitutes the nation's cultural treasure and shall be under the protection of the State, which may regulate its disposition.

Consequently, Section 24, Article IX of the Bangsamoro Organic Law mandates the Bangsamoro Government to preserve the history, culture, art traditions, and rich cultural heritage of the Bangsamoro people and their Sultanates, such as those of Sulu, Maguindanao, Kabuntalan, Buayan, the Royal House of Ranao and of the Iranun, and the non-Moro indigenous peoples of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

The Sultanate of Sulu was founded by Sultan Sharieful Hashim, who introduced Islamic political institutions and made Islam the state religion. Thus, it is only befitting that we take steps to promote his invaluable contribution to our political consciousness and aspiration by preserving, conserving, and developing his tomb to serve as a constant reminder of our origin and illustrious past.

Furthermore, it will enhance and promote Tausug Culture and will contribute to the prestige of Sulu as the cradle of the Bangsamoro government.

To be declared a historical heritage site and an ecotourism destination, the Bangsamoro people will have the chance to experience heritage tourism that includes authentically representing the stories and people of the past, particularly the rich culture of the Province of Sulu and its people.

Hence, this proposal is an Act Declaring the Tomb of Sultan Sharieful Hashim as a historical heritage site and ecotourism destination.

I, therefore, humbly request my esteemed colleagues to help me pass this bill.
