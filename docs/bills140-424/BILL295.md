**AN ACT**
**TO ENHANCE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO, CREATING FOR THE PURPOSE THE GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM BUREAU OF THE BANGSAMORO PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY, AMENDING FOR THE PURPOSE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMY ACT NO. 13, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

This proposed legislative measure aims to usher in a new era of efficient and sustainable development within the Bangsamoro region. By mandating the use of Geographic Information System (GIS) technology in the planning, execution, and oversight of development projects, this legislation seeks to harness the power of geospatial data and analysis.

This strategic integration of GIS will enable precise resource allocation, data-driven decision-making, and the promotion of sustainable development principles. Furthermore, the creation of the Geographic Information System Bureau (GISB) within the Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority will ensure the development and dissemination of geospatial data and expertise. Through capacity building, transparency, and accountability measures, this Act endeavors to empower stakeholders to drive a more prosperous, equitable, and environmentally responsible future for the region.

This Act represents a significant step forward in enhancing the planning and implementation of development projects within the Bangsamoro region. By embracing the transformative capabilities of GIS technology, it aspires to empower the region’s decision-makers, promote inclusivity and sustainability, and ultimately improve the quality of life for its residents. This legislative measure recognizes the importance of data-driven, precise, and transparent development efforts for a more inclusive and progressive future in the Bangsamoro region.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.

b. Geospatial Data – refers to information that is linked to a specific location or geographic coordinates on the earth’s surface. Geospatial data can include attributes related to natural features (e.g. rivers, mountains), man-made features (e.g. roads, buildings), land use, land cover, demographic data, and environmental parameters.
c. Development Projects – refers to any project, program, or initiative undertaken by the Bangsamoro Government aimed at economic, social, environmental, or infrastructural development. This includes urban planning, agriculture, transportation, water resources, public health, education, and disaster management.

**Section 4. Geographic Information System Bureau.** – Section 41 (2), Chapter 3 (D), Title III, Book IV of Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 13 is hereby amended to read as follows:
