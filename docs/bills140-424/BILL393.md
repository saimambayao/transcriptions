**AN ACT CONVERTING THE MATANOG WORLD ASSEMBLY OF MUSLIM YOUTH (WAMY) CLINIC IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF MATANOG, PROVINCE OF MAGUINDANAO DEL NORTE, INTO A LEVEL I HOSPITAL WITH TEN (10)-BED CAPACITY, TO BE KNOWN AS THE MATANOG DISTRICT HOSPITAL, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.**

**Explanatory Note**

The 1987 Philippine Constitution, in Section 15, Article II, declares that the state shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. Section 11, Article XIII declares that the State shall adopt an integrated and comprehensive approach to health development, making essential goods and services accessible to all at an affordable cost.

In the Bangsamoro Region, It is the policy of the Bangsamoro Government under Section 22, Article IX of the Republic Act No. 11054 otherwise known as the "Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao" to provide for a comprehensive and integrated health service delivery for its constituents and establish by law a general hospital system to serve the health requirements of its people and ensure that the individual basic right to life shall be attainable through the prompt intervention of excellence and affordable medical services. In pursuit of this, the government shall prioritize the upgrading of existing health facilities to provide life-saving and basic medical care.

In the heart of the Bangsamoro Region, the Municipality of Matanog in Maguindanao Del Norte stands as a resilient community striving for peace, stability, and inclusive development. With a previous total population of 36,034 residents as of the 2020 census of the Philippine Statistics Authority, Matanog has long faced systemic challenges in accessing reliable and adequate healthcare. Its rugged terrain, distance from major urban centers, and limited government infrastructure have all contributed to the persistent health disparities experienced by its people. The Municipality has a total of 8 Barangays, most of which are classified as geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas.

In response to this need, the World Assembly of Muslim Youth (WAMY) established a clinic in Matanog as part of its humanitarian outreach. This facility provided basic medical care to residents who would otherwise have had to travel long distances to seek treatment at Dr. Serapio B. Montaner, Jr. Al-Haj Memorial Hospital, located in Malabang, Iranun District Hospital, located in Parang, or Cotabato Regional and Medical Center in Cotabato City. The WAMY Clinic evolved into more than just a health outpost; it became a symbol of hope and partnership in public health service delivery.

However, temporary solutions are no longer enough. According to Department of Health (DOH) standards, a Level I hospital is typically established to serve a population of at least 10,000 to 30,000 people, depending on geographic isolation and health service accessibility. With over 41,146 residents and growing as of the latest census, which is the 2024 census of the Philippine Statistics Authority, Matanog exceeds the minimum population requirement and fully qualifies for its own Level I hospital. This becomes even more urgent when we consider the growing population from neighboring municipalities and the upland barangays that rely on Matanog as their nearest service hub.

This proposed measure seeks to convert the WAMY Clinic into a Level I government hospital under the Ministry of Health, BARMM. As a Level I hospital, the facility will be staffed with qualified medical professionals and equipped with basic emergency, surgical, maternal, and pediatric services, essential components of primary healthcare delivery. More importantly, it will be accessible to all, particularly the poor and vulnerable, under the government’s health insurance and social protection programs.

The conversion will not only strengthen the health system in Matanog; it will also: Spur local employment and professional opportunities for health workers, reduce maternal and child mortality through improved services, ease the burden on distant hospitals in Malabang, Parang, or Cotabato City, and contribute to long-term peace and development by investing in human dignity and well-being.

In view of the above, ensuring access to basic, quality, and affordable medical services for the Bangsamoro People must be given priority by the BARMM Government. Essentially, this can be realized by establishing a general hospital in identified strategic areas of the BARMM, such as in Matanog, Maguindanao Del Norte.

Thus, in view of the foregoing, the immediate approval of this bill is earnestly sought.
