**“AN ACT ESTABLISHING TUMBAO GENERAL HOSPITAL WITH TWENTY-FIVE BED CAPACITY IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF KABUNTALAN AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR”**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The 1987 Philippine Constitution, in Section 15, Article III declares that the State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. Section 11 Article XIII declares that the State shall adopt an integrated and comprehensive approach to health development that shall endeavor to make essential goods, health and other social services available to all the people at affordable cost.

Hospital is a place devoted primarily to the maintenance and operation of facilities for the diagnosis, treatment and care of individuals suffering from illness, disease, injury or deformity, or in need of obstetrical or other medical and nursing care. It is also the place where there are installed beds, or cribs, or bassinets for twenty-four-hour use or longer by patients in the treatment of diseases, diseased-conditions, injuries, deformities, or abnormal physical and mental states, maternity cases, and all institutions such as those for convalescence, sanitarial or sanitarial care, infirmities, nurseries, dispensaries and such other names by which they may designated.

The Municipality of Kabuntalan is composed of 17 barangays with more or less 25,000 population. There is no hospital located within these municipality. In fact, when the need for such service arises, the patients have no other option but to reach out the hospitals located at Cotabato City or Midsayap, north Cotabato.

Based on the standards set forth by the Department of Health, it provides that the ratio of bed capacity is 1 bed for every 1000 population. Applying such standard, this requires that in order to accommodate the more or less 25,000 population of the municipality of Kabuntalan, there must be a general hospital with at least 25 bed capacity.

The establishment of general hospital in the municipality of Kabuntalan may serve primarily, but not limited to, patients coming from the municipality of Kabuntalan but also from those coming from the barangays of Northern Kabuntalan such as: Libungan, Kapimpilan, Guiawa, Tumaguinting, Balong, and Montay. It may also extend its service from those patients coming from the areas located in riverside of Liguasan marsh such as barangays of Midsayap, Aleosan, and Datu Piang.

In view of the above, ensuring access to basic, quality and affordable medical services for Bangsamoro people must be given priority by the BARMM government. Essentially, this can be realized by establishing a general hospital in identified strategic areas in BARMM, such as in Kabuntalan Maguindanao Del Norte.

Thus, in view of the foregoing, the immediate approval of this bill is earnestly sought.
