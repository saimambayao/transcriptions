**AN ACT ESTABLISHING MICRO-GRID SOLAR SYSTEMS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

Be it enacted by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament in session assembled:

**SECTION 1. Short Title.** – This Act shall be known as the “Solar Energy Promotion and Accessibility Act”.

**SEC 2. Declaration of Policy.** – It is hereby declared the policy of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao:

a. to ensure a continuous, adequate, and economic supply of energy;
b. to promote the use of renewable energy source and;
c. to promote low sustainable power generation policies.

The Bangsamoro Government recognizes the need to diversify energy sources and promote sustainable, renewable energy, particularly solar energy. This policy aims to promote the utilization of solar energy to ensure energy security, reduce carbon emissions and enhance the quality of life for the people of BARMM, particularly in far-flung and underserved areas.

**SEC 3. Objectives.** – This Act aims to:

a. Provide incentives for solar energy development and investment in BARMM.
b. Encourage the use of solar energy in both urban and rural areas, including remote communities.
c. Foster innovation and local manufacturing of solar power systems and components.
d. Establish solar energy systems in public institutions such as schools, hospitals, and government offices.
e. Specifically address the energy needs of far-flung areas with limited or no electricity access.

**SEC 4. Solar Power Incentive Program.** – The Bangsamoro Government shall create a Solar Power Incentive Program to:

a. Provide tax reductions for companies and individuals investing in solar power projects.
b. Offer subsidies for households and small businesses installing solar panels, particularly in underserved and off-grid areas.
c. Set up a revolving fund for financing solar energy projects in communities with limited access to electricity, prioritizing far-flung areas.

**SEC 5. Solar Energy for Public Institutions.** – Within three (3) years of the enactment of this Act, at least fifty percent (50%) of the electricity consumption of public institutions in BARMM shall be sourced from solar energy. This includes schools, hospitals, government buildings, and other public infrastructures, with a focus on ensuring access in remote areas.

**SEC 6. Micro-Grid Solar Systems in Remote and Far-Flung Areas.** – The Ministry on Environment, Natural Resources and Energy (MENRE) shall establish micro-grid solar systems in remote and far-flung communities, with priority given to areas that are not connected to the main power grid. These systems will be designed to be sustainable and easily maintainable by local government units and its residents.

**SEC 7. Selection of Beneficiaries.** – The MENRE, in collaboration with relevant agencies and stakeholders, shall systematically select the area for the location of micro-grid solar systems based on energy needs, geographical location, solar power potential, and sustainability.

Clear guidelines and criteria shall be established to ensure sustainability, promote community engagement, and address environmental impacts. This selection process aims to maximize the benefits of renewable energy, reduce emissions, and contribute to the region’s environmental goals.

**SEC 8. Community Solar Initiatives.** – The Bangsamoro Government shall encourage community-led solar initiatives in far-flung areas, providing technical support for local groups to install and maintain solar energy systems, fostering ownership and sustainability.

**SEC 9. Research and Development (R&D) Promotion.** – The Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) shall:

a. Encourage R&D in solar technology, focusing on making solar power more efficient and cost-effective for BARMM.
b. Collaborate with universities, private companies, and international agencies to develop localized solar technologies suitable for tropical environments.

**SEC 10. Implementation and Monitoring.** – The Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources, and Energy (MENRE) shall be tasked with implementing this Act, in coordination with the Ministry of Public Works, Ministry of Interior and Local Government (MILG), Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), and other related agencies.
