**AN ACT**
**CREATING THE BANGSAMORO RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT COUNCIL, PROVIDING FOR ITS MANDATE AND FUNCTIONS, MEMBERS AND OFFICERS, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The establishment of the Bangsamoro River Basin Management Council (BRBMC) is a pressing imperative, driven by the urgent need to address critical ecological and governance challenges within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).

Section 9 of Article XIII of the Organic Law for the BARMM underscores the vital importance of transferring the management and protection of nature reserves and protected areas within the region from the authority of the National Government to the Bangsamoro Government. This directive is rooted in principles of local autonomy and sustainable development, recognizing that the well-being of both the environment and the people of the Bangsamoro depend on effective, locally-led governance.

However, despite the clear mandate and significant passage of time, this transfer has not been fully realized in so far as the management, administration and full authority over the river basin within and along the scope of the region is concerned. This delay compromises ecological integrity, impedes sustainable development efforts, and hampers the realization of local autonomy.

The creation of the Bangsamoro River Basin Management Council (BRBMC) serves a crucial and multifaceted purpose within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. One of the foremost reasons for its establishment is to address an inherent administrative and coordination deficiency within the current institutional landscape.

Currently, there is no specific and designated office within BARMM with which the Mindanao River Basin Management Council (MRBMC) can seamlessly and systematically coordinate. This conspicuous absence of a dedicated coordinating entity results in systemic challenges and complications concerning the chain of communication and coordination between the MRBMC and the stakeholders operating within BARMM.

This void has profound implications, as the effective management and protection of river basins are paramount for the ecological well-being and sustainable development of the region. The absence of a designated coordinating office hinders the timely exchange of vital information, the alignment of policies and strategies, and the collaborative efforts essential for the efficient stewardship of these invaluable natural resources.

By establishing the BRBMC, this legislative endeavor not only addresses the current administrative gap but also streamlines coordination mechanisms, ensuring that BARMM stakeholders have a structured and accessible avenue for engagement with the MRBMC.

The river basin found in BARMM is not an isolated entity but, rather, an extensive, continuous stretch of land that transcends different local government territories. It is an interconnected network that crisscrosses geographical boundaries, encompassing various jurisdictions within the entirety of Mindanao. Given this complex reality, effective management, protection, and sustainable development of these river basins necessitate an integrated approach that recognizes the independency of these water bodies. Therefore, It is paramount that the Bangsamoro Government establishes a robust and seamless coordination mechanism with the MRBMC.

For all intents and purposes, this strategic development is not merely a procedural enhancement; it is instrumental in facilitating harmonious and effective collaboration between the MRBMC, the Bangsamoro Government, and relevant government agencies. By aligning closely with the MRBMC, the BRBMC ensures that its policies, initiatives, and strategies are in harmony with the broader regional and national objectives concerning river basin management. It facilitates the exchange of knowledge, expertise, and resources, thereby enhancing the collective capacity to address the multifaceted challenges posed by river basin governance.

In fine, the creation of the BRBMC is a vital step towards enhancing coordination and communication between the MRBMC and BARMM, which are essential prerequisites for the responsible management and protection of the Mindanao river basins. It underscores our commitment to sustainable development and the ecological well-being of the region while promoting clarity, coherence, and synergy in our collective efforts.
