**AN ACT**
**ESTABLISHING A COMPREHENSIVE SPECIAL EDUCATION (SPED) SERVICE AND SUPPORT CENTERS (CSSSCs) IN STRATEGIC REGIONAL HUBS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM), PROVIDING FOR INTERAGENCY COORDINATION, CAPACITY BUILDING, CONTEXTUALIZED AND INCLUSIVE SERVICES, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Children with disabilities (CWDs) in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) encounter numerous and interconnected barriers to education and development. According to a 2020 report from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA)¹, the number of children in BARMM with functional difficulties exceeds 33,000. Despite ongoing efforts, a substantial portion of these children remain excluded from formal education or lack access to the comprehensive support services they require. Although some special education (SPED) centers have been established in urban areas, their distribution is uneven, and the quality and inclusivity of services vary significantly. Consequently, children from geographically isolated, conflict-affected, and indigenous communities experience persistent educational marginalization.

Given this situation, there is an urgent need for a region-specific, culturally grounded, and equity-driven model of SPED service delivery. The proposed legislation, known as the “Comprehensive SPED Service and Support Centers (CSSSC) Act of 2025,” aims to address this need through a coordinated, interministerial framework that provides inclusive, accessible, and responsive services for all CWDs across the five provinces and three cities of BARMM. Unlike Parliament Bill No. 255, which mandates the establishment of a single SPED center per municipality, this proposal takes a distinct approach by emphasizing hub-and-spoke models. The CSSSCs are envisioned not merely as instructional facilities but as regional hubs for diagnostics, therapy, teacher training, family empowerment, and curriculum innovation tailored to the specific context of the Bangsamoro.

Research published in esteemed peer-reviewed journals underscores the effectiveness of this approach. A 2021 study by Tan-Mansukhani and Lozada in the International Journal of Inclusive Education highlighted significant gaps in special education provision, particularly within diverse and conflict-sensitive contexts such as Mindanao. The authors recommended the establishment of localized, culturally sensitive education hubs supported by integrated interagency cooperation (Tan-Mansukhani & Lozada, 2021)². Similarly, the Asia Pacific Journal of Education posits that inclusive education is most sustainable when it is rooted in community involvement and contextualized to local cultural-linguistic realities (Miles & Singal, 2010)³. These findings validate the bill’s provisions for community-based special education units, outreach services, and curriculum contextualization.

Importantly, this bill aligns with both global and national mandates. It is founded on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD)⁴, which the Philippines ratified in 2008. Additionally, it supports the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4, which focuses on inclusive and equitable quality education, as well as SDG 10, aimed at reducing inequality. On a national level, it complements the Magna Carta for Persons with Disabilities (RA 7277), the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (RA 10533), and the Inclusive Education Act of 2022 (RA 11650). Regionally, the bill is coherent with the Bangsamoro Education Code, the Bangsamoro Development Plan 2023–2028, and the Bangsamoro Children’s Rights Code.

A significant strength of this measure is its focus on research, innovation, and cultural responsiveness. CSSSCs (Centers for Special Services and Support for Children) are designed not only to deliver services but also to serve as hubs for action research, curriculum adaptation, and the development of assistive technologies. By incorporating Indigenous knowledge and local languages into curriculum materials, this initiative aligns with the culturally responsive education framework outlined in the BARMM Education Code. Moreover, the bill promotes the active involvement of parents and caregivers through the establishment of Regional Councils of Parent Leaders of Children with Disabilities, acknowledging their essential role as primary stakeholders in inclusive education.

The CSSSCs are also envisioned as disaster-resilient and conflict-sensitive institutions. Given the history of displacement and climate-induced emergencies in BARMM, the bill mandates the integration of disability-inclusive disaster risk reduction (DRR) strategies within educational protocols. Additionally, the CSSSCs will oversee centralized Special Education (SPED) Information and Referral Systems (SIRS), aimed at consolidating accurate and real-time data on children with disabilities (CWDs) for effective planning, evaluation, and policy-making. The absence of reliable data has long been recognized as a systemic hurdle within the Philippine SPED landscape (Cruz & Cruz, 2020)⁵.

The bill ultimately establishes pathways for lifelong learning and transition-to-work programs. In collaboration with the Ministry of Labor and Employment (MOLE) and private partners, Comprehensive SPED Service and Support Centers (CSSSCs) will implement vocational training, job coaching, and livelihood support initiatives aimed at ensuring that young individuals with disabilities are equipped for economic independence and full social integration.

Thus, the Comprehensive SPED Service and Support Centers (CSSSC) Act of 2025 represents a timely and transformative advancement toward achieving inclusive and rights-based education in the Bangsamoro region. It transcends mere programmatic intervention, embodying a strategic policy commitment that aligns with the aspirations of Bangsamoro autonomy, principles of inclusive peacebuilding, and the global mandate to ensure no one is left behind.

In light of the above, the immediate approval of this proposed measure is sincerely requested.
