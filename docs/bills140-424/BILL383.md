**ESTABLISHING THE BANGSAMORO SOCIAL EQUITY INVESTMENT FUND FOR INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC PARTICIPATION, PROVIDING FOR THE ALLOCATION OF NON-TRANSFERABLE EQUITY SHARES TO VULNERABLE BANGSAMORO SECTORS, PROMOTING PRIVATE SECTOR ENGAGEMENT THROUGH CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, ENSURING SHARI'AH-COMPLIANT GOVERNANCE AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is navigating a historic transition aimed at consolidating peace, building inclusive governance, and fostering equitable socio-economic development for its diverse population. This region, home to Muslim Moro groups and Indigenous communities, carries the legacies of conflict, marginalization, and underdevelopment. Despite BARMM’s rich natural and human resources, it remains one of the most impoverished regions in the Philippines. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority (2023)¹, BARMM posted a poverty incidence of 35.9% in 2022, far above the national average of 18.7%. This disparity signals entrenched structural inequalities and limited access to wealth-generating opportunities for ordinary Bangsamoro citizens.

Globally, the movement toward inclusive economic systems has gained momentum, particularly through models that promote equitable participation of marginalized populations in wealth creation. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) emphasize decent work and economic growth (SDG 8) and reducing inequality (SDG 10), underscoring the role of financial inclusion in fostering peace and sustainable development.² Experiences in Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia show that community-based equity and enterprise models not only boost local income and employment but also rebuild social trust in post-conflict regions.³ However, these gains are sustainable only when they are aligned with local governance structures, cultural values, and religious frameworks.

In the Philippines, the government has introduced participatory economic frameworks such as the Maharlika Investment Fund Act⁴, which seeks to mobilize investments for national infrastructure and development. However, the unique socio-cultural context of BARMM necessitates a localized and culturally sensitive approach. This includes integrating Islamic finance principles and ensuring⁵ that the Bangsamoro people hold direct equity stakes in enterprises operating within their region.

The current economic programs in BARMM, although well-intentioned, are often limited to aid-driven, short-term interventions. These fail to create pathways for long-term financial self-reliance among the Bangsamoro people. There is a noticeable gap in institutionalizing mechanisms that allow marginalized citizens to hold equity in productive enterprises. In particular, there is a lack of Shari’ah-compliant financial vehicles that align with Islamic values and ethical investment practices. Moreover, private sector participation remains minimal, partly due to the absence of targeted incentives and clarity in governance procedures adapted to BARMM’s socio-political environment. These gaps result in missed opportunities to harness community capital and entrepreneurial energy for regional growth and self-determination.

To respond to these challenges, the Bangsamoro People’s Equity and Enterprise Participation Act of 2025 proposes the creation of a Social Equity Investment Fund (SEIF), a non-lapsing trust fund designed to support direct, equitable, and culturally relevant economic participation. The SEIF shall consolidate capital from diverse sources, including government appropriations, private sector Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) contributions, zakat (almsgiving), waqf (endowment) donations, and reinvested earnings. This pooled capital will be used to acquire equity shares in strategic enterprises, local industries, and infrastructure projects across BARMM. The fund aims to deliver both financial returns and socio-economic dividends to its constituents.

A key feature of the bill is the institutionalization of non-transferable equity shares, which will be held in trust for the Bangsamoro people to prevent speculative trading and ensure long-term community ownership. Dividends from these investments will be equitably distributed through the Ministry of Social Services and Development (MSSD), prioritizing support for widows, orphans, the elderly, persons with disabilities, and other vulnerable sectors. This mechanism promotes collective prosperity and social protection, while upholding Islamic principles of wealth redistribution and moral stewardship. All investment decisions and fund operations will comply with Shari’ah law, subject to review by the Darul Ifta’ of BARMM.

The governance of the SEIF will be entrusted to an Inter-Ministerial Social Equity Investment Board (ISEIB), composed of representatives from relevant ministries, financial institutions, and civil society. To promote transparency and accountability, the Bangsamoro Commission on Audit (BCOA) shall conduct regular financial audits, and annual public disclosures shall be required. The bill also introduces fiscal incentives for private investors and partners, such as CSR tax credits and Shari’ah-compliant investment certifications. These provisions aim to attract responsible capital into priority sectors such as halal food production, sustainable agriculture, digital innovation, tourism, and renewable energy—sectors where BARMM holds comparative advantages.

The significance of this bill lies in its alignment with both global best practices and local cultural realities. By establishing a Shari’ah-compliant equity investment mechanism, the proposed legislation empowers the Bangsamoro people to move from being passive beneficiaries of aid to active stakeholders in development. It institutionalizes an inclusive economic framework that promotes wealth generation, social equity, and ethical investment. The bill also strengthens the legal infrastructure for public-private collaboration in the region, thereby enhancing investor confidence and governance capacity within BARMM. Moreover, it reinforces the peace-building objectives of the Bangsamoro Organic Law⁶, which recognizes economic justice as integral to political reconciliation and lasting stability.

In essence, the Bangsamoro People’s Equity and Enterprise Participation Act of 2025 reflects the aspirations of the Bangsamoro for meaningful autonomy, prosperity, and dignity. It is not merely an economic measure but a social justice agenda rooted in Islamic ethics, constitutional equity, and international human development goals. Through this legislation, the Bangsamoro Parliament affirms its commitment to a future where economic power is democratized, local industries are revitalized, and the wealth of the region is returned to its people. This is a step forward in realizing the shared vision of a peaceful, prosperous, and empowered Bangsamoro society.
