**MANDATING THE CREATION OF ONE HIGH SCHOOL PER BARANGAY, OR CLUSTER OF TWO BARANGAYS, IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**Explanatory Note**

In the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 26 affirms that, "*Everyone has the right to education.*" Today, this article from the declaration is reflected in our national and local laws.

Under the 1987 Constitution, Section 1, Article XIV provides that the State shall "*protect and promote the rights of all citizens to quality education at all levels and shall take appropriate steps to make such education accessible to all*". Furthermore, Section 2 of the same article mandates the State to "*establish and maintain a system of free education in the elementary and high school levels*".

This is also similarly expressed in Section 13, Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), which states that the Bangsamoro Government shall "*provide, maintain, and ensure the delivery of basic and responsive health programs, quality education, appropriate services, livelihood opportunities, affordable and progressive housing projects, power and electricity, and water inhabitants of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.*"

Additionally, Section 16, Article IX of the BOL also encompasses "*the priority of the Bangsamoro Government to establish, maintain, and support a complete and integrated system of quality education, which shall be a subsystem of the national education system*". Where it is further expressed that the Bangsamoro Government shall "*develop an educational framework relevant and responsive to the needs, ideals, and aspirations of the Bangsamoro people. For this purpose, the Bangsamoro Government shall conform to the minimum standards set by the National Government*". Altogether, the declaration and our laws vividly express the Government’s responsibility in implementing and protecting the Bangsamoro’s right to education.

Education is one of the catalysts of the growth and development of the society. According to the 2016 World Economic Forum (WEF), education increases the efficiency of each individual worker and helps economies move up the value chain beyond manual tasks or simple production processes. The 2016 WEF suggested three channels through which education affects a country’s productivity. First, education increases the collective ability of the workforce to carry out existing tasks more quickly. Second, Secondary and Tertiary Education facilitates the transfer of knowledge about new information, products, and technologies created by others¹. Finally, by increasing creativity, education can boost a country’s own capacity to create new knowledge, products, and technologies.² Through these channels, one can discern education’s impact towards society, where it becomes imperative for the Parliament to ensure this right is accessible for its constituents.

Every Bangsamoro must have easy and unrestricted access to quality education. The Bangsamoro Government must ensure that every child, including the marginalized, the disadvantaged, and those living in remote and poverty-stricken areas, must all have equal and equitable opportunities to education, regardless of their social class, race, gender and ethnic background.

Additionally, numerous young individuals in the region have been deprived of education due to decades of armed conflict. Over the years, the lack of education eventually led to a high rate of unemployment, which is further exemplified by the region’s poor and displaced families. Long-lasting conflicts and violence in BARMM and in its surrounding regions, have also deprived children of the opportunity to study in school under stable conditions.³

Across all levels of the formal education, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) consistently had the lowest participation and completion rates among all regions. In 2017, the Net Enrollment Rate (NER) in the BARMM fell below the national average by about 20% points at the elementary level and 45% points at the Junior High School (JHS) level.⁴

In 2017, school completion rate for elementary schools was at 54% against a national average of 94%, where recent years show that increasingly more students have been able to graduate from elementary schools. At the JHS level, around 62% of Grade 7 students continued to study until Grade 10, where the national average was 85%. However, the dropout rate per grade in the BARMM worsened from 11% in 2010 to 14% in 2017, which accumulates through a basic education cycle and has led to significantly low school completion rates.⁵

In other terms, only 1 out of every 10 students who began primary education in the BARMM would eventually graduate from lower secondary education on time. If there were 10 children living in BARMM, at best, 8 (eight) out of those 10 children would enter Grade 1 on time, but only 5 (five) would complete Grade 6. Then, 2 (two) out of the 4 children who graduate from elementary school would enroll in JHS. Eventually, only 1 (one) child out of the 10 would complete Grade 10 on time. Statistically, this leaves 9 (nine) children for every 10 that are out of school without completing the full basic education cycle.

In view of the increasing need for a complete, adequate, and integrated system of education, and in attempt to mitigate the number of children unable to complete the full basic education cycle, it is imperative to create and establish one high school in every barangay in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

In furtherance of the Bangsamoro government’s primordial duty as *parens patriae*, or the guardian of the rights of the people, it is necessary to prioritize the needs of the students. This includes the provision of a better access to quality education. The establishment of a school in every barangay that caters to high school students within their domicile can provide not only provide better access and opportunity for all the students to secure high school education, but can also help lessen their daily expenses, and reduce the time that they spend travelling to school. By and large, this bill aims to give the youth the privilege to live an improved life through meaningful and accessible education, where most importantly, the Bangsamoro can become significant forces of change in nation-building.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
