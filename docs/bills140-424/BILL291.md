**AN ACT INCORPORATING BASIC AGRI-FISHERY KNOWLEDGE IN THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS CURRICULUM IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM), PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES¹**

**Explanatory Note**

Under the 1987 Constitution, “*The State shall recognize the right of farmers, farmworkers, and landowners, as well as cooperatives, and other independent farmers' organizations to participate in the planning, organization, and management of the program, and shall provide support to agriculture through appropriate technology and research, and adequate financial, production, marketing, and other support services.*” (Section 5, Article XIII).

It is stated in Section 3, Article V of Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the promotion of health and safety. Section 2 of the same article also provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise its authority over matters including agriculture, food security, inland waters, public works, and infrastructure water supply and services, flood control and irrigation systems, among others.

Moreover, Section 23, Article XIII of the BOL provides that with the policies and laws of Bangsamoro Government on agriculture as a key development strategy, it shall promote productivity measures, and provide support for small farmers, landholders and marginal fisherfolk.

In 2019, the former Secretary of the Department of Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel F. Pinol said that they are expecting the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) to be a major food producer for the Philippines in five years. In a text message in response to *BusinessWorld*, he even said that the potential for food production is immense, and that in five years the Bangsamoro area will be a major food producer for the country². Moreover, Secretary Pinol also elaborated that there are about 100,000 hectares of land suitable for high-value crops like cavendish banana, pineapple, cacao, abaca, and hybrid coconut, alongside acknowledging that there are emerging rice farms in the region in the Liguasan Marsh along the Mindanao River basin and Lake Lanao in Lanao del Sur. Lastly, he also expanded on other resources, stating that the region could be the major source of cultured fish, not to mention freshwater fish from the Liguasan Marsh and Lake Lanao, and that for rice, the region has the potential of producing at least 3 million metric tons of paddy rice every year³.

Overall, the Bangsamoro Region has the potential to become a significant agricultural hub in the Philippines. Thus, a legislative measure must be taken to securely advance the agriculture and fishery in the region.

A substantial effort in advancing these would be through the creation of a mandatory subject that will be taught in the school. Analogous to the fundamental concepts found in agriculture, the creation of a subject to be taught to students is akin to planting seeds for the future, where imparting knowledge on basic agriculture and fishery to all pupils and students in the region can pave the way for interest and advancement. This way, the Bangsamoro Government can inculcate in the minds of the children and youth the importance of agri-fishery.

The importance of equipping the youth with the adequate knowledge and attitude towards agriculture can help the Bangsamoro region prosper since the region is heavily dependent on agriculture as one of its sources of livelihood⁴.

In addition, igniting interest in the children and youth can further strengthen the agri-fishery sector in the region. There is a need to foster the innovative ideas of the children and youth since they are the future leaders in the region. They will be in-charge of building and sustaining a prosperous and peaceful region.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
