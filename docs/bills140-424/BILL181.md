**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

War can leave behind a trail of destruction and chaos, leaving many communities struggling to pick up the pieces and rebuild. The Marawi siege, which lasted for five months in 2017, had a significant impact on the country, particularly on the city of Marawi and its residents. The immediate effects of the siege were the displacement of thousands of residents, the destruction of their homes, the disruption of trade and commerce, and the loss of income and livelihoods. Included in the losses are some cultural properties which are likewise of significant value.

Amidst this chaos, it is important to remember the significance of preserving artifacts and other cultural properties that serve as a tangible link to the past. These cultural properties help us understand our history, culture, and heritage, and they hold valuable lessons that can inform our future.

This bill recognizes the importance of safeguarding the historical and cultural properties found in Marawi City from looting and destruction, which pose a significant threat to the city's cultural and historical identity. This bill aims to protect and preserve these artifacts for the benefit of future generations.

Due to the foregoing, immediate passage of this bill is earnestly requested.
