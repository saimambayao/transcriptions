**AN ACT**
**CREATING THE BANGSAMORO INVESTIGATIVE RESEARCH AGENCY, DEFINING ITS POWERS AND FUNCTIONS, PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

This bill seeks to establish the mechanism to repress the practice of corruption and development aggression by any public and private persons in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, and consequently to contribute to the reign of Moral Governance and development justice in the region.

In keeping with this purpose, the bill attempts to create the **Bangsamoro Investigative Research Agency (BIRA)** to: (i) provide professional investigation services and research outputs, either solely or in coordination and collaboration with trusted private individuals and groups and/or public servant(s) or office(s); (ii) establish a functional information and data system that will aid the Bangsamoro government to secure inclusive and amiable political, social, economic, cultural and ecological ambiances in the region; (iii) offer insights, decisions and actions that will consistently impart tactical and strategic advantage to the government; (iv) build and sustain unequivocal administration and development geniality in the region, and (v) eventually establish normal life of the Bangsamoro.

While corruption and development aggression might not be a serious problem at the present state of the autonomous region if optimists may think it that way, the traditional saying **"bend the crooked bamboo while it is young"** applies; or if these ills of Moral Governance do not exist at all in the region today as a few others may understand it, the ordinary expression **"prevention is better than cure"** still maneuvers. And most importantly, this proposed measure may be considered a **legacy of the present Bangsamoro Parliament and Bangsamoro leadership** considering its intent as above-mentioned, which obviously support the present leadership’s consistent advocacy on Moral Governance.

It can be noted that morality in governance is the forefront campaign of the Bangsamoro government under the leadership and guidance of the honorable Chief Minister Ahod "Al Haj Murad" Ebrahim. Ideally, complete observance of Moral Governance by the Bangsamoro public servants in the exercise of their respective functions, duties and responsibilities will stimulate wholesome, inspired, passionate and straightforward workplace administration and public service, which in effect enhance the Bangsamoro region's peace and security, socio-political stability, economic growth, stable ecological balance and intercultural vigor among the constituents. Again, this proposed measure is a potent mechanism to preserve Moral Governance in the Bangsamoro region.

This proposed legislation operationally defines corruption as any form of dishonest endeavors undertaken by a person or an organization entrusted with a position or authority to acquire illicit benefit or to abuse entrusted power for private gain. Founded on this definition, corruption does not only include one's direct access to government wealth and property for personal use, but it also embraces nepotism, graft or manipulation, bribery, extortion, patronage, embezzlement or misappropriation (of funds), influenced bidding and peddling, and even incompetence and inefficiency in public service and spending official time to irrelevant activities. Development aggression, on the other hand, refers to the introduction and establishment of any development program, project or activity (PPA) that violates the rights of the constituents to normal life; negates ecological balance in the affected communities, either intentional or unintentional; and, depletes the natural resources of these communities due to the absence of any contingent mechanism to restore and sustain these resources. This unproductive development intervention may be implemented by the state or regional governments, Local Government Units (LGUs), private-public groups, corporations or individuals.

This bill is inspired by existing laws that are potential to discourage corrupt practices, either directly or indirectly. These laws include, but not limited to: (a) the **Philippine Constitution of 1987**, particularly Section 1 (Public Office is a Public Trust), Article XI (Accountability of Public Officers); (b) **Republic Act No. 3019**, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act of 1960; specifically enumerated in Section 3 hereof; (iii) **Republic Act No. 9485**, an Act to improve efficiency in the delivery of government service to the public by reducing bureaucratic red tape, preventing graft and corruption and providing penalties therefor; and (iv) **Republic Act No. 6713**, otherwise known as the "Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees", particularly in Section 2 hereof, which declares that "It is the policy of the Government to promote a high standard of ethics in public service, and provides that "Public officials and employees shall at all times be accountable to the people and shall discharge their duties with utmost responsibility, integrity, competence, and loyalty, act with patriotism and justice, lead modest lives, and uphold public interest over personal interest".

Also, some provisions of this bill are influenced by a number of laws, which discourage the practice of development aggression, either directly or indirectly. These laws include, but not limited to: (i) the **Philippine Constitution**, which asserts that "The State shall protect and advance the right of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology in accord with the rhythm and harmony of nature (Section 16, Article II), among others; (ii) **Presidential Decree No. 1151, s.1977**, which advances both the productive and harmonious relationship of nature and the Filipino people of today and the future; and, (iii) **Republic Act No. 7942**, an Act governing all mining operations and related rights in the Philippines, specifically exploration, development, and utilization of natural resources conservation through a partnership of the government and private sector.

Moreover, certain provisions of **Republic Act No. 10867**, otherwise known as the "National Bureau of Investigation Reorganization and Modernization Act," which provides that "It is the policy of the State to promote and maintain an effective, modern, gender-responsive, competent and highly trained investigative body that is functionally integrated and national in scope", enlightened this proposed bill in the contextualization especially of its mandates, powers and functions.

Finally, **Republic Act No. 11054**, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law, provides legal justifications for the approval of this bill. This is in reference to specific provisions of the Act, to wit: (i) **Sec. 2, Art. IV**, which permits the BARMM to exercise its right to self-governance, i.e. the regional government is free to pursue its political, economic, social and cultural development tasks as provided for in this Organic Law; (ii) **Sec. 32 (h), Art. VII**, which grants the Chief Minister to exercise such other powers and functions inherent to the office; and (iii) **Sec. 9, Art. XVI**, which allows the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) the authority to **create offices** .... without prejudice to the authority of the Bangsamoro Government to reorganize the bureaucracy upon its constitution, or any time thereafter.

The proposed **Bangsamoro Investigative Research Agency (BIRA)** is in deed an essential force to admonish and prevent the reign of corruption and development aggression in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, and eventually contribute to the institutionalization of Moral Governance and development justice in the region, In Sha Allah. Hence, full support of the honorable members of the Bangsamoro Parliament is earnestly prayed.
