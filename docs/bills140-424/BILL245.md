**ESTABLISHING A PROGRAM TO HELP CHILDREN DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD) IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**Explanatory Note**

Article 2, Section 15 of the 1987 Constitution provides that the State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them.

The same was reiterated in Section 2, Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), which also states that the Bangsamoro Government shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. It shall also uphold the peoples' right to have access to essential goods health, and other social services that promote their well-being. This is an emphasis that paramount importance is given to health.

Additionally, Section 2(r) of R.A. 11054 also states that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise its authority over the development programs and laws for women, labor, youth, the elderly, the differently-abled, and indigenous peoples.

Together, these laws lay out the foundation of the Government’s responsibility to look after its constituent’s health and overall well-being. It is evident in provisions such as Section 2(r) that these efforts should also extend to specific and or marginalized sectors.

Thus, it is imperative that the Bangsamoro Government continues to recognize and identify the needs of these sectors, in order to further deliver and improve health service delivery towards its citizens.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder that affects how people interact with others, alongside their abilities to communicate, learn, and behave. Although autism can be diagnosed at any age, it is described as a “developmental disorder” because symptoms generally appear in the first 2 years of life.¹

According to the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)*, a guide created by the American Psychiatric Association that health care providers use to diagnose mental disorders, people with ASD often have:

a) Difficulty with communication and interaction with other people;
b) Restricted interests and repetitive behaviors; and
c) Symptoms that affect their ability to function in school, work, and other areas of life.²

Moreover, Autism is known as a “spectrum” disorder because there is a wide variation in the types and severity of symptoms people experience.³

It is estimated that worldwide about 1 in 100 children has autism⁴, where in the Philippines, this equates to about one in 100 Filipinos⁵ being on the autism spectrum, translating to approximately 1.2 million of our countrymen living with autism today.

Although Republic Act No. 7277, or the Magna Carta for Disabled Persons laid the foundations for the recognition and protection of rights of persons with disabilities, including those on the spectrum, there is still an inadequacy of programs that address the needs of the Bangsamoro diagnosed with autism.

It is the duty of the Bangsamoro Government to provide protection and care to every Bangsamoro, especially those on the spectrum to address and support their peculiar needs. Everyone has the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standards of physical and mental health.

Currently, in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, there is no law that promotes the general welfare of those diagnosed on the spectrum, especially its early identification, assessment, and support.

This bill aims to increase awareness and proper understanding of ASD, in hopes that it can serve as a catalyst of normalizing ASD, and de-stigmatizing negative connotations around the discourse of ASD in our society. The bill can help create an environment that is conducive to the growth and development of individuals with ASD, by providing easy access to affordable therapies and education, alongside services and support for them to live self-sufficiently within the community, and hopefully minimize or complete remove discrimination and promote inclusivity within the region.

Individuals who are on the spectrum are an underrepresented segment of the region, where they are vulnerable due to their physical, mental, intellectual, and sensory impairments. Today, these impairments continue to hinder their access to the basic services that the government offers. The overall well-being of every Bangsamoro, including those on the spectrum, is of paramount importance, which is exactly why we need to open our eyes to the realities that these people continue to face.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
