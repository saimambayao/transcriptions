**AN ACT PROVIDING FOR THE PROTECTION OF CONSUMER RIGHTS AND WELFARE IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO, CREATING THE BANGSAMORO CONSUMER PROTECTION COUNCIL, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The protection of consumers is a fundamental responsibility of government, anchored on the constitutional mandate to promote the general welfare and ensure the rights of the people to health, safety, and a balanced economy. In the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), the protection of consumer rights and welfare assumes greater significance, given the distinct socio-cultural, economic, and religious context of the region.

At present, consumers in BARMM remain vulnerable to a wide range of exploitative practices. Experiences from local markets and communities reveal instances of **deceptive sales and advertising**, such as false product claims and misleading discounts; **the sale of hazardous or substandard products**, including expired food, counterfeit medicines, uncertified electrical devices, and non-halal goods; **price manipulation**, particularly hoarding and profiteering in rice, fuel, and other basic commodities; and **abuses in digital commerce**, such as online fraud, undelivered purchases, and misuse of personal data. These practices mirror the consumer vulnerabilities already recognized under Republic Act No. 7394, otherwise known as the *Consumer Act of the Philippines*, but are aggravated in BARMM by the absence of regional mechanisms for enforcement, education, and redress.

Such practices not only erode consumer confidence but also distort market competition, burden households with unjust costs, and endanger public health and safety, thereby impairing the stability of the regional economy and the overall welfare of the Bangsamoro people. The need for a localized and culturally responsive framework becomes even more urgent in view of the growing reliance on digital platforms for trade and the increasing demand for halal-certified, eco-friendly, and locally produced goods.

This proposed measure, entitled the “**Bangsamoro Consumers Act of 2025**,” seeks to establish a comprehensive legal framework for the protection of consumers within the region. Specifically, it aims to:

1. Institutionalize the rights of consumers, including the rights to safety, information, choice, representation, redress, education, a healthy environment, and data privacy;
2. Define the duties and responsibilities of consumers to encourage vigilance, responsible consumption, and respect for cultural and religious sensitivities;
3. Create the **Bangsamoro Consumer Protection Council (BCPC)** under the Ministry of Trade, Investments, and Tourism (MTIT), to serve as the primary agency responsible for consumer protection, with policy-making, investigatory, and educational functions;
4. Prescribe prohibited acts such as deceptive sales practices, sale of hazardous products, price manipulation, unfair trade practices, violation of warranties, and digital fraud;
5. Provide administrative, civil, and criminal penalties to ensure compliance and accountability; and
6. Appropriate funds for the effective implementation of this Act, with continuing budgetary support from the Bangsamoro Government.

The enactment of this measure will ensure that consumers in BARMM are adequately protected, empowered, and informed, thereby fostering a fair marketplace, enhancing public confidence, and contributing to regional economic growth consistent with Islamic values, cultural sensitivities, and sustainable development.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly requested.
