**AN ACT ENSURING MANDATORY EVACUATION CENTERS IN EVERY BARANGAYS OF THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO, DESIGNED TO CREATE A HAVEN THAT PRIORITIZE SAFETY, ACCESIBILITY, FULLY-EQUIPPED FACILITIES, EMPOWERMENT, AND RESILIENCE AND PROVIDING FUND THEREOF.**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The proposed "Safer Haven Act" aims to establish a mandatory evacuation center in each barangay within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). Recognizing the vulnerability of the region to various calamities, including flooding, armed conflict, and other disasters, this act emphasizes the urgent need for reliable and secure evacuation centers that prioritize the safety and well-being of evacuees.

By enacting this act, we seek to ensure that every barangay in the BARMM is equipped with a designated evacuation center that adheres to the core principles of safety, accessibility, fully-equipped facilities, empowerment, and resilience. These evacuation centers will serve as crucial havens during emergencies, providing adequate shelter, sanitary facilities, potable water supply, storage areas for relief goods, communication systems, and medical and first aid facilities.

The Safer Haven Act mandates the cooperation and support of relevant government units and ministries, including the Ministry of Interior and Local Government, Ministry of Public Order and Safety, Ministry of Social Services and Development, Ministry of Public Works, Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education, and the Bangsamoro Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office. Through collective efforts, these entities will oversee the establishment, construction, and maintenance of the evacuation centers, ensuring that they meet the specific needs and challenges faced by the BARMM.

Funding for the establishment, construction, and maintenance of the evacuation centers will be allocated from the Bangsamoro Appropriation Act. Additionally, the act encourages partnerships with national government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and other stakeholders to explore additional sources of funding, supplementing the allocated budget.

By enacting the Safer Haven Act, we aim to enhance the resilience of the Bangsamoro people and strengthen the institutional capacity for disaster management at the local level. This act underscores our commitment to safeguarding the lives and properties of the residents of the BARMM, providing them with safe and inclusive evacuation centers in times of crisis.

Based from the foregoing, the approval of this bill is urgently requested.

The purpose of this act is to establish evacuation centers in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) that adhere to the core principles represented by the acronym SAFER.

**Sustained Safety:** Evacuation centers prioritize the safety and well-being of individuals during emergencies. Measures such as structural integrity, hazard mitigation, and emergency response protocols ensure the sustained safety of evacuees.

**Accessibility for All:** Evacuation centers are designed to be inclusive and accessible to all individuals, including persons with disabilities, elderly individuals, and pregnant women. Barrier-free access, appropriate facilities, and accommodations are provided to ensure that everyone can seek refuge without hindrance or discrimination.

**Fully-Equipped Facilities:** Evacuation centers are equipped with essential facilities and resources to meet the basic needs of evacuees. This includes adequate shelter spaces, sanitary facilities, potable water supply, storage areas for relief goods, communication systems, basic medical and first aid facilities, ramps for accessibility, proper lighting, ventilation, and child-friendly spaces and facilities.

**Empowerment:** Evacuation centers empower evacuees by providing them with necessary support, resources, and information to cope with emergencies. Educational programs, skills training, and psychosocial support are offered to enhance the self-reliance and resilience of individuals, enabling them to actively participate in their own recovery and rebuilding efforts.

**Resilience:** Evacuation centers promote community resilience by fostering a culture of preparedness and proactive disaster management. This includes conducting regular drills, establishing early warning systems, promoting disaster risk reduction measures, and facilitating community engagement and participation in disaster response and recovery planning.
