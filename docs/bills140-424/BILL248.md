**AN ACT**
**REGULATING THE DISTRIBUTION AND/OR USE OF SINGLE-USE PLASTICS PRODUCTS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The negative impacts of single-use plastics on the environment are well-documented, ranging from pollution of water bodies and soil to harm caused to wildlife through ingestion and entanglement. Additionally, the improper disposal of single-use plastics contributes significantly to the degradation of forests, parks, zoos, and other protected areas within the region. As responsible stewards of our environment, it is incumbent upon us to take decisive action to curb the use of these harmful materials.

To achieve this goal, this Act proposes a comprehensive approach that encompasses the regulation of the distribution and use of single-use plastic products within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. Specific exemptions have been incorporated to ensure the continued availability of essential medical and hygiene-related items, disaster relief necessities, and accommodations for persons with disabilities.

Moreover, the Act emphasizes the promotion of sustainable alternatives to single-use plastics. The Bangsamoro Government, in collaboration with local communities, businesses, and stakeholders, will actively encourage the use of eco-friendly materials, such as reusable bags, biodegradable, and compostable products, to replace single-use plastics.

Recognizing the vital role of government procurement in shaping consumption patterns and market demand, this Act mandates all government agencies to lead by example in adopting sustainable procurement practices. The government shall prioritize the procurement of products and materials with eco-friendly packaging options and collaborate with suppliers who align with these environmental goals.

In addition, this Act extends its scope to include regulations on single-use plastic usage in forests, parks, zoos, and similar protected areas. By enforcing a strict prohibition on single-use plastics in these natural habitats, we aim to preserve and protect the integrity of these ecosystems and enhance visitor experiences.

This legislative measure also highlights the importance of public awareness and education campaigns. By engaging with schools, public spaces, and media channels, the regional government intends to instill a sense of responsibility and foster behavioral changes that support the transition away from single-use plastics.

Through this proactive and holistic approach, we seek to create a paradigm shift towards sustainable practices that promote environmental conservation, public health, and economic prosperity. We firmly believe that by implementing the Bangsamoro Single-Use Plastic Regulation Act, we can make significant strides in ensuring a greener, cleaner, and more sustainable future for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
