**AN ACT ESTABLISHING A REGIONAL FACILITY AND SYSTEM FOR THE PROTECTION, REHABILITATION, AND REINTEGRATION OF CHILDREN INVOLVED IN ARMED CONFLICT IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO, PROVIDING STANDARDS, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**Explanatory Note**

Republic Act No. 11188, the "Special Protection of Children in Situations of Armed Conflict Act," recognizes children involved in, affected by, or displaced by armed conflict as victims entitled to special respect, protection, rescue, rehabilitation, and reintegration within a framework of restorative justice. In the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), where communities have historically experienced the effects of armed conflict and displacement, Children Involved in Armed Conflict (CIAC) require child-specific, culturally and religiously sensitive interventions delivered in a civilian-run, non-carceral setting.

At present, while the Ministry of Social Services and Development (MSSD) coordinates active child-protection programs—including case management, psychosocial support, referral pathways, and community-based networks—BARMM does not yet have dedicated, specialized CIAC facilities. CIAC cannot be accommodated in juvenile justice rehabilitation centers for Children in Conflict with the Law (CICL)—including Bahay Pag-asa centers or their successor institutions—because of the different legal frameworks, program objectives, and risks of re-traumatization and programmatic mismatch. This facility gap undermines consistent, child-friendly handover from security forces to civilian social welfare authorities, prolongs uncertainty in rehabilitation planning, and strains local social service systems.

This bill provides a fit-for-purpose regional solution aligned with Republic Act No. 11054 (Bangsamoro Organic Law) and BARMM's principles of moral governance. It will:

1. Establish dedicated, civilian-run CIAC facilities by regional cluster, separate from detention, correctional, and juvenile justice rehabilitation centers for CICL (e.g., Bahay Pag-asa), with room for satellite/transitional centers to reach geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas;

2. Designate MSSD as the lead implementing ministry with authority to set and enforce standards, license/accredit, and supervise CIAC facilities, while enabling flexible staffing through secondment, contracting, and partnerships;

3. Institutionalize inter-agency coordination through a BARMM Inter-Agency Committee on CIAC (BIAC-CIAC) to align rescue, handover, health (including mental health and psychosocial support), education (including Alternative Learning System), religious/cultural guidance, and community reintegration;

4. Codify intake, custody, and handover protocols consistent with RA 11188—presumption of minority, civilian custody, child-friendly rescue, no tactical interrogation, confidentiality, and data protection—ensuring only child-sensitive interviews by trained civilian personnel occur within facilities for protection and case management;

5. Mandate monitoring and evaluation, including annual reporting and periodic third-party reviews, and require harmonization with applicable national and regional Children in Situations of Armed Conflict (CSAC) guidelines so that the most protective standard prevails over time; and

6. Provide sustainable financing through the BARMM General Appropriations Act, with augmentation from permissible sources subject to applicable laws and guidelines, and encourage partnerships with local governments, civil society organizations, faith-based groups, academe, and development partners.

In view of the urgent need to provide safe, therapeutic, and child-appropriate residential care for CIAC in BARMM—consistent with national law and regional priorities—the immediate passage of this measure is earnestly sought.
