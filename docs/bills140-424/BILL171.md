**AN ACT**
**MANDATING THE INTEGRATION OF BANGSAMORO AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLES’ CULTURE, TRADITIONS, CUSTOMS AND BELIEFS IN THE SECONDARY EDUCATION CURRICULUM OF ALL PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN BARMM, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Bangsamoro region is home to various ethnic groups such as *Tausug, Meranao, Maguindanaon, Iranun, Yakan, Sama, Badjao, Jama Mapun, Kagan/Kalagan, Kalibugan, Sangil, Molbog, Palawanon, Teduray, Lambangian, Manobo Dulangan, Visaya, Tagalog, and Chinese* who have their own unique traditions and practices.

On the other hand, Article IX, Section 24 of R.A. No. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law states that the Bangsamoro government shall preserve the history, culture, arts, traditions, and the rich cultural heritage of the Bangsamoro people and their Sultanates, such as those of Sulu, Maguindanao, Kabuntalan, Buayan, the Royal House of Ranao and of the Iranun, and the non-Moro indigenous peoples of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

In preserving and transmitting culture, education plays a vital role. It is through education that cultural knowledge and values are passed on from one generation to the next. Education helps to pass on the traditions and customs of a culture, as well as the language and other forms of communication used to express cultural identity. It also provides opportunities for individuals to learn about and appreciate the customs, beliefs, and values of other cultures. Education can help people to understand the importance of preserving their cultural heritage and the necessity of sharing it with others. Education makes culture more concrete and real. It socializes an individual on the one hand, and it preserves, transmits, and promotes the culture of a society on the other.

In order to fulfill the mandate of preserving the history, culture, arts, traditions, and rich cultural heritage of the Bangsamoro people, which is the basis of the creation of an autonomous region, a separate subject for Bangsamoro and Indigenous People’s Culture, Traditions, Customs and Beliefs will be integrated in the secondary education curriculum of all public and private educational institutions in BARMM.

For these reasons, this representation earnestly asks for the approval of the bill.
