**AN ACT PROVIDING FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE REGIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH LITERACY AND PROMOTION ON THE EFFECTS AND BENEFITS OF VACCINATION, PROVIDING FOR GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY ON FLU VACCINATION, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFORE AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

"Flu continues to affect the health condition of many Filipinos regularly due to a sudden weather change. With this, flu vaccination remains the best way to prevent the illness. As low flu immunization rollout becomes a recurring problem, the government must double its efforts in addressing the issue of vaccine hesitancy among the locals."¹

The flu, also known as influenza, is a widespread illness in the Philippines, particularly during the holiday season when the weather changes abruptly. The Department of Health (DOH) has recently issued a disease surveillance report cautioning the public about the increasing number of influenza-like cases. From January 1 to August 12, 2023, there have been 114,127 reported cases and counting, which is 52% higher than the 74,957 cases reported during the same period last year.²

Seasonal influenza, or the flu, is a respiratory infection that occurs suddenly and lasts for a short period of time. It is a sudden respiratory infection resulting from influenza viruses. There are four distinct types of influenza viruses: A, B, C, and D. Influenza A and B viruses are prevalent, leading to seasonal outbreaks. Influenza A viruses have been responsible for causing global pandemics. The flu tends to spread rapidly in places with high human density, such as schools, shopping centers, markets, and other crowded environments. When an individual infected with the virus coughs or sneezes, tiny droplets containing the viruses are released into the air, potentially infecting those in close proximity. Additionally, the virus can be transmitted through contact with hands contaminated by influenza viruses. It is noteworthy that influenza has the potential to exacerbate symptoms in individuals with pre-existing chronic diseases, and severe cases may escalate to conditions like pneumonia and sepsis.³

Every year, there are approximately one billion cases of seasonal influenza, with 3–5 million of these cases classified as severe illnesses. The impact of influenza extends to causing 290,000–650,000 respiratory-related deaths annually. Notably, 99% of deaths among children under the age of five with lower respiratory tract infections linked to influenza occur in developing countries.⁴

Vaccines have been used for more than 60 years and to this day, they are essential to control influenza and are considered the best way to prevent it. Immunity from vaccination goes away over time, so annual vaccination is recommended to protect against influenza. While DOH recommends an anti-flu shot yearly, many Filipinos are still hesitant to get vaccinated. Some reasons for the refusal include (1) de-prioritization of vaccination due to consumers being ‘too busy’, (2) consumer perception of low risk of influenza contraction; (3) lack of awareness among consumers, especially the elderly, regarding the severity of influenza; (4) consumer absence of access to the influenza vaccine and unawareness of the availability of free vaccine for certain groups; (5) affordability challenges for some Filipino families in obtaining vaccines.

Beyond these obstacles, widespread vaccine hesitancy is significantly fueled by the unsettling experience many locals had with Dengvaxia, a dengue vaccine embroiled in controversy. Reports of alleged deaths, particularly among children, linked to Dengvaxia gained attention, with organized relatives, particularly mothers, amplifying their concerns on mainstream and social media. Despite prior approval by the Food and Drug Administration based on scientific evidence, the country suspended the dengue vaccination program and permanently banned the vaccine in 2019.⁵ This event severely eroded public trust, extending to other vaccines, notably COVID-19 vaccines, which faced strong negative perceptions and resistance among the public.⁶

To improve flu vaccination rates, the government should conduct extensive campaigns promoting awareness of the vaccine's nature, benefits, and side effects, leveraging various mass media channels, particularly social media. Health workers should clarify misinformation related to the Dengvaxia controversy. Equally crucial is the allocation of a sufficient regional budget for free flu vaccines across age groups or offering affordable options for broader accessibility. Collaboration with private organizations and religious groups can enhance vaccine availability. Implementing a house-to-house setup, especially for senior citizens, would overcome accessibility challenges, allowing health workers to deliver the awareness program and administer vaccinations on-site.⁷
