**AN ACT ESTABLISHING A DRUG DEPENDENT TREATMENT AND REHABILITATION CENTERS IN EVERY PROVINCE OF THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM), APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.**

**Explanatory Note**

The 1987 Philippine Constitution, in Section 15, Article II, declares that the state shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. Section 11, Article XIII declares that the State shall adopt an integrated and comprehensive approach to health development, making essential goods and services accessible to all at an affordable cost.

In the Bangsamoro Region, Section 22, Article IX of the Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the “Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao” also declares that the Bangsamoro Government shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them, and it shall also uphold the people’s right to have access to essential goods, health, and other social services that promote their well-being.

The prevalence of drug dependence remains a public health and social concern in the BARMM. While the national government has established rehabilitation facilities in other regions, BARMM lacks fully operational, government-owned treatment and rehabilitation centers in all its provinces. Existing initiatives, such as Balay Silangan, are primarily reformation facilities and do not fully address the medical, psychological, and reintegration needs of drug dependents.

This Bill seeks to establish one fully operational Drug Dependent Treatment and Rehabilitation Center in every BARMM province to provide comprehensive, accessible, and sustainable interventions. It aligns with the principles of moral governance, peacebuilding, and human development, and ensures that the Bangsamoro Government fulfills its responsibility to protect and rehabilitate its people.

Thus, in view of the foregoing, the immediate approval of this bill is earnestly sought.
