**Explanatory Note**

The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is ushering in a new era of peace, stability, and inclusive development after decades of armed conflict. A key aspect of sustaining the gains of the peace process is ensuring the successful transformation and reintegration of former combatants, especially women, into peaceful and productive members of society.

Women played vital roles in the Bangsamoro struggle as fighters, medics, intelligence officers, political commissars, and support personnel. Their contributions and sacrifices were instrumental in advancing the cause of the Bangsamoro people for self-determination. However, as the region transitions from conflict to development, many former women combatants face challenges in building new lives and livelihoods.

This proposed measure, to be known as the "Economic Empowerment of Former Bangsamoro Women Combatants Act of 2024", seeks to provide a comprehensive framework for empowering former Bangsamoro women combatants economically and socially. It is anchored on the Bangsamoro Government's commitment to promote social justice, gender-responsiveness, and women's rights as embodied in the Bangsamoro Organic Law and the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women.

The bill aims to enable former women combatants to establish sustainable livelihoods and become agents of peace and development in their communities. It outlines a range of programs and interventions covering active citizenship, entrepreneurial leadership, skills training, livelihood assistance, agricultural and industry support, business incubation, access to finance, market linkages, social protection, and psychosocial services among others. These interventions will harness their potential as economic actors and leaders.

The measure designates the Office of the Chief Minister as the lead implementing agency, with the support of other relevant ministries. It also creates a Coordinating Council to ensure effective coordination, implementation, and monitoring. The bill establishes a grievance mechanism to address issues in accessing the programs.

Funding will be sourced from the Bangsamoro Government's budget as well as from donations and grants. This underscores the high priority placed on the welfare and development of former women combatants as part of the overall normalization process under the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro.

In view of the foregoing, the immediate enactment of this bill is earnestly sought. Its passage will demonstrate the Bangsamoro Government's strong resolve to uphold the rights and wellbeing of former women combatants. It will send a clear message that no one will be left behind in the shared task of building a peaceful, progressive, and resilient Bangsamoro.
