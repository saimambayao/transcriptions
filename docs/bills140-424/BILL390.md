**AN ACT**
**MANDATING THE ADVANCE RELEASE OF SALARIES IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION WHEN PAYDAY FALLS ON A WEEKEND OR HOLIDAY, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**Explanatory Note**

This proposed measure seeks to mandate the advance release of salaries for government employees in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) when regular paydays fall on weekends or holidays. While national and regional laws require timely wage disbursement, they do not explicitly provide for early release under such circumstances.

The Bangsamoro Government values its employees and their welfare. By ensuring that salaries are released ahead of non-working days, this measure allows employees to access and utilize their earnings without delay, especially during weekends and holidays when financial needs often arise. If passed, employees will no longer have to wait for the next working day to receive their salaries that should have been made available earlier.

Approval of this measure is earnestly sought.

Respectfully submitted,

**ATTY. KITEM D. KADATUAN**
