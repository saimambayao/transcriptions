**AN ACT MANDATING ALL PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS TO PROHIBIT THE SALE AND DISTRIBUTION OF ANY UNHEALTHY FOODS INSIDE THE PREMISES OF THEIR RESPECTIVE INSTITUTIONS**

**Explanatory Note**

The 1987 Philippine Constitution has very specific provisions concerning the youth. Section 13, Article II of the 1987 Constitution states that the State recognizes the vital role of the youth in nation-building and shall promote and protect their physical, moral, spiritual, intellectual, and social well-being. It shall inculcate in the youth patriotism and nationalism, and encourage their involvement in public and civic affairs.

Section 15 of the same article states that the State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. This same provision was also stated in Section 22, Article IX of R.A. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL).

Section 3, Article V of the BOL states that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants.

The Department of Education issued Department Order No. 13, Series of 2017, titled, “Policy and Guidelines in Healthy Food and Beverage Choices in Schools and in DepEd Office”, wherein schools must ensure that the food and drinks available to students in the school premises are healthy and nutritious.

Within these declarations and policies exist the importance of the youth, specifically children, and the current measures undertaken that the Government has undertaken to ensure their health. However, despite these existing policies, the status of nutrition among school-age children in the Philippines continues to exist with challenges.

The 2021 Expanded Nutrition Survey focused on the status of Filipino School-age Children in the Philippines, showing the following results:

*   one (1) in every five (5) (20.8%) school-age children is underweight;
*   one (1) in every five (5) (19.7%) school-age children is stunted;
*   one (1) in every fifteen (15) (6.9%) school-age children is wasted or underweight for their height; and
*   one (1) in every ten (14%) school-age children is overweight for their height.

It is within this survey that the obesity of children can be purported and attributed to easy access to unhealthy foods in the school, which makes the healthier options the last option. Obesity and the state of being overweight are defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the “abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health”. Along with being underweight and micronutrient deficient in the body, obesity is part of the triple burden of malnutrition affecting children around the Philippines. In essence, a child suffering from obesity is at a serious disadvantage in life, prone to non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes, cancer, and heart failure.

Children spend most of their hours in school where their parents cannot monitor them. The schools are expected to look after the welfare of the children by promoting a healthier lifestyle. Children getting adequate nutrients should be a priority, since good nutrition allows the children to be more productive in school as this can help with their overall cognitive development.

The eating preferences of the children can be controlled by removing all of the unhealthy foods which are affordable, available, and easily accessible as options within the premises of the school. If no measures are taken and unhealthy foods are still readily and easily accessible in school, the children may frequently consume this kind of food, thus increasing the risk of obesity and other diseases that can lead to chronic health issues.

In furtherance of the Government’s primordial duty as *parens patriae* or the guardian of the rights of the people, it is necessary to prioritize the health of the students. This can be achieved by prohibiting the sale and distribution of any unhealthy food inside the premises of the school.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
