**AN ACT PROVIDING A HAVEN AND REHABILITATION CENTER FOR WOMEN WHO ARE VICTIMS OF GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE, PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Gender-based violence remains a significant concern in our society, with women often bearing the brunt of its impact. The country has established firm laws that safeguard women's rights. There is the Magna Carta for Women, which seeks to eliminate discrimination through the recognition, protection, fulfillment, and promotion of the rights of Filipino women, especially those belonging to the marginalized sectors of society. Also, there is the "Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004," which protects women and children from any form of violence.

The Bangsamoro Region has Bangsamoro Organic Law upholding and protecting the fundamental rights of women, including the right to be protected from exploitation, abuse, or discrimination.

Despite the existence of concrete laws addressing gender-based violence concerns, VAW persists.

According to the 2022 National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) conducted by the Philippine Statistics Authority, 17.5% of Filipino women aged 15-49 have experienced any form of physical, sexual, and emotional violence from their intimate partners. As of 2021, there were eight thousand three hundred ninety-nine (8,399) reported cases of physical violence, one thousand seven hundred ninety-one (1,791) of rape, and one thousand five hundred five (1,505) of acts of lasciviousness.

Societal norms and traditions dictate people to think that men are the leaders, pursuers, and providers and take on the dominant roles in society. At the same time, women are the nurturers, men's companions, and supporters, and they take on subordinate roles in society. This perception leads men to gain more power over women. Hence, violence becomes a form of men's expression of control over women to retain power.¹

Because of this long-imprinted belief, men subject women to be housekeepers, completely dependent upon them for support. This leads women to hesitate in taking action against the abuse they endure, fearing that leaving their homes would leave them with nowhere to go and no resources to survive. This dependency not only perpetuates the cycle of abuse but also traps women in harmful situations.

The implementation of this act offers a refuge for abused women seeking safety from possible retaliation by their abusers. These centers provide a secure and confidential environment where women can access protection without fear of being harmed. Furthermore, during their stay, residents will have access to skills training programs to equip them with the necessary skills to support themselves after they leave.

The Women's Rehabilitation Center Act provides women with safe havens where they can receive the necessary care, support, and rehabilitation to recover from their traumatic experiences and rebuild their lives.
