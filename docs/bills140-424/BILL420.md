**AN ACT ESTABLISHING THE SALAMAT HASHIM BOARDING MADRASAH (SHBM), DEFINING ITS MANDATE, STRUCTURE, AND CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK, PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), provides that it shall be the top priority of the Bangsamoro Government to establish, maintain, and support a complete, quality, and culturally grounded educational system that responds to the needs and aspirations of the Bangsamoro people. Section 16, Article IX of the BOL explicitly emphasizes the government's responsibility to maintain an integrated system of education that upholds both academic excellence and relevance to the moral ideals of the region.

In harmony with this mandate, the Bangsamoro Education Code (BAA No. 18) requires the integration of Islamic education into the regional curriculum, strengthening Arabic proficiency, and institutionalizing support for Madaris and faith-based learning institutions. The Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP) 2023–2028 further identifies youth formation, faith-based learning, and culturally responsive education as instrumental pillars for peacebuilding, community development, and moral governance.

The Salamat Hashim Boarding Madrasah Act of 2025 seeks to establish a public boarding madrasah in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) that integrates faith-based and culturally responsive education with the K–12 curriculum. This initiative aligns with the BOL, Bangsamoro Education Code (BAA 18), and the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education (MBHTE) Public Madrasah Framework, all of which mandate the Bangsamoro Government to provide inclusive, quality education that reflects the region's Islamic and cultural values. The institution aims to develop morally upright, academically competent, and community-rooted youth capable of contributing to peacebuilding, civic responsibility, and moral governance.

The SHBM will offer full-time residential education for Grades 7–12, combining secular subjects with advanced Islamic studies, Qur’anic and Arabic language proficiency, and leadership formation. It prioritizes access for high-performing learners from underserved communities while accommodating non-Muslim students with alternative values education. Governance will be overseen by a Board of Trustees representing government, academia, civil society, and religious authorities, with MBHTE maintaining regulatory and budgetary authority.

The Act also provides for faculty development, scholarships through the Salamat Hashim Scholarship Fund, safe and gender-sensitive boarding facilities, and compliance with child protection and disaster resilience standards. Its implementation strengthens moral governance, promotes peacebuilding, and honors the legacy of Salamat Hashim by nurturing morally upright, academically competent, and community-rooted youth capable of contributing to the development and stability of BARMM.

In view of the foregoing, the immediate passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
