**Explanatory Note**

One of the declared policies of the State, as provided in the 1987 Constitution, is to promote a just and dynamic social order that ensures the prosperity and independence of the nation and free the people from poverty through policies that provide adequate social services, promote full employment, a rising standard of living, and an improved quality of life. Sections 10-11, Article II of the Constitution also declares that the State shall provide social justice in all phases of national development and that the State values the dignity of every human person and guarantees full respect for human rights. Section 4, Article XV of the Constitution further declares that it is the duty of the family to take care of its elderly members while the State may design programs of social security for them.

Section 2(r) of R. A. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law states that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise its authority over the development programs and laws for women, labor, youth, the elderly, the differently-abled, and indigenous peoples.

Based on the 2010 Census of Population and Housing (CPH) released by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), of the 92.1 million household population in the country, 1.44 million persons or 1.57 percent have disability. The recorded figure of persons with disability (PWDs) in the 2000 CPH was 935,551 persons, which is 1.23 percent of the household population.¹

In 2020, the PSA reported that Filipinos who are 60 years of age and older comprised 8.5 percent of the population or 9.2 million. This figure is double the country’s aging citizens’ number from 2000, when the percentage was just 5.9 percent of the national population or 4.5 million.²

As a Bangsamoro, we give our utmost respect to our families’ elderly members and those with disabilities. We give due consideration to their needs by taking all necessary measures that provide them ease and convenience. Consequently, it is then the duty of the Bangsamoro Government to give consideration to the elderly and PWDs. The Government has the responsibility to act as the guardian of its citizens and look after the well-being of its people, especially those who have special needs and requirements. Thus, the Government shall assure the prioritization of the elderly and PWDs in the delivery of government services. One way of promoting their general welfare is through the creation of a help desk that can cater their needs.

As proposed in this measure, the creation of a special help desk dedicated to senior citizens and PWDs seeks to cater to their needs by offering them assistance and a venue where they can raise their inquiries, with the end goal of the promotion of their interests and protection of their rights and overall well-being. The special help desk shall cater to their complaints and help them in finding proper solutions. This can ensure that their immediate concerns are addressed in a proper and timely manner.

The creation of the special help desk is in pursuance of the objectives of the Expanded Senior Citizens Act, which is to recognize the right of senior citizens to take their proper place in society and make it a concern of the family, community, and government, and to adopt measures where our senior citizens are assisted and appreciated by the community as a whole. The mandate of the Office of the Senior Citizens Affairs is only for the availing of support services, benefits, and privileges accorded to seniors. There is no mandated senior citizen’s desk in every office that will give them additional protection and assistance.

The establishment of the special help desk is also in pursuance of Republic Act No. 7277 or the Magna Carta for Disabled Persons in which the state is mandated to give full support to the improvement of the total well-being of disabled persons and to ensure that they are given the same rights and privileges as a Filipino without prejudice to their disability.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
