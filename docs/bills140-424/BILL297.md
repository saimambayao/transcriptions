**AN ACT**
**PROMOTING RESILIENT DEVELOPMENT THROUGH MANDATORY COMPREHENSIVE RISK ASSESSMENTS OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The integration and mainstreaming of risk reduction into the planning and budgeting of the various development projects of the government is essential not only to promote growth in the region but also to prioritize the safety and well-being of the Bangsamoro communities in the face of evolving disaster risks and climate change challenges.

In fact, Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, places a premium on disaster risk reduction and management, and climate change adaptation as it expressly mandates the formulation of a Bangsamoro Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan to provide a framework for effective disaster preparedness and response in the region.

Thus, the primary purpose of this proposed measure is to ensure the safety, sustainability, and resilience of development initiatives in the region. Specifically, it aims to institutionalize a comprehensive risk assessment process that prioritizes disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation measures. By integrating this process into the development planning framework, the legislation seeks to fortify the region's ability to withstand and recover from various risks.

The measure is a vital step toward building a sustainable and resilient future for the Bangsamoro region. By incorporating comprehensive risk assessments into the development planning processes, we aim to create a foundation for projects that not only promote growth and progress but also prioritize the safety and well-being of our communities in the face of evolving risks and challenges.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
