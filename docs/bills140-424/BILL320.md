**AN ACT INSTITUTIONALIZING PUBLIC PETITIONS IN THE BANGSAMORO PARLIAMENT AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The right to petition the government is a fundamental aspect of democratic governance. It empowers citizens to express their concerns, suggest reforms, and demand accountability from their elected representatives. In the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), fostering a culture of participatory governance is essential for ensuring that the voices of all citizens, especially the marginalized and underrepresented groups, are heard and considered in the legislative process.

The Bangsamoro Organic Law (Republic Act No. 11054) provides the framework for governance in BARMM, emphasizing the importance of public participation and transparency. However, there is a need for a more structured and accessible mechanism to facilitate citizen engagement through public petitions. This Act aims to institutionalize such a process, making it easier for citizens to contribute to the decision-making processes of the Bangsamoro Parliament.

The proposed bill seeks to establish a formal process for the Bangsamoro people to submit public petitions, ensuring their active participation in the legislative and administrative processes of the Bangsamoro Parliament. It will create a transparent system for the filing, tracking and responding to public petitions, ensuring that government actions are accountable to the people. In addition, it will institutionalize public petitions as a regular and integral part of the legislative process in BARMM, thereby strengthening democratic practices the institution.

Under this bill, citizens are granted the right to submit public petitions on any matter of public interest or concern. This provision ensures that all residents of BARMM have a formal avenue to voice their concerns and suggestions. To ensure that petitions represent genuine public interest, a minimum of 100 signatures from registered voters in BARMM is required. This helps to filter out frivolous petitions and focus on substantial issues.

The Act mandates a structured review process, wherein petitions are referred to the appropriate committee for examination and public hearings if necessary. This ensures that each petition is given due consideration. Petitions can be submitted in person, by mail, or electronically. This flexibility makes it easier for citizens from various backgrounds and locations to participate.

The progress and status of petitions are made publicly accessible through an official website. This transparency builds trust in the system and keeps the public informed about the actions taken on their petitions. The establishment of a Public Petitions Office within the Bangsamoro Parliament provides the necessary support and resources to help citizens understand the petition process and prepare their submissions.

The institutionalization of public petitions is expected to have a significant positive impact on governance in BARMM. By providing a clear and accessible mechanism for citizen engagement, this Act will enhance public trust in government institutions and encourage greater civic participation. It will also ensure that the Bangsamoro Parliament remains responsive to the genuine needs and concerns of its constituents, thereby fostering a more inclusive and democratic society.

In fine, the enactment of the Bangsamoro Public Petitions Act represents a vital step toward achieving participatory governance in BARMM. It aligns with the principles of democracy and transparency outlined in the Bangsamoro Organic Law and contributes to the overall goal of building a government that is accountable, responsive, and inclusive. By empowering citizens to directly engage with their government, this Act will help to create a more vibrant and dynamic political landscape in the Bangsamoro region.

For these reasons, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
