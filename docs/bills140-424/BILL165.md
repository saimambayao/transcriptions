**AN ACT PROVIDING FOR A SYSTEM OF INITIATIVE IN THE BANGSAMORO AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

In the Philippines, the power of the people to directly initiate legislation is enshrined in Article VI, Sections 1 of the Philippine Constitution, which provides:

> “the legislative power shall be vested in the Congress of the Philippines which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives, **except to the extent reserved to the people by the provision on initiative and referendum.** (emphasis supplied)”

as well as in Section 32, which states:

> “The Congress shall, as early as possible, provide for a system of initiative and referendum, and the exceptions therefrom, whereby the **people can directly propose or enact laws or approve or reject any act or law or part thereof passed by the Congress or local legislative body** after the registration of a petition thereof signed by at least ten per centum of the total number of registered voters, of which every legislative district must be represented by at least three per centum of the registered voters thereof. (emphasis supplied)”

This Constitutional provision is operationalized at the national level through Republic Act No. 6735, also known as *The Initiative and Referendum Act*. Section 4 thereof states: “The power of initiative and referendum may be exercised by all registered voters of the country, **autonomous regions**, provinces, cities, municipalities and barangays. (emphasis supplied)”

Meanwhile, Republic Act No 11054, also known as the *Bangsamoro Organic Law*, mandates that the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region shall have a democratic political system that allows its people to freely participate in the political processes within its territorial jurisdiction.¹

The Organic Law further reinforces this principle by expressly providing that the Bangsamoro Parliament has the power, among others, to **enact a law on initiatives²** as well as call for a referendum³ on important issues affecting the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

To give life to the above-declared principles in the Constitution and in the Organic Act of the region, it is imperative that the Parliament, within this transition period, enact a law that will define and set the parameters for the exercise of the power of initiative in the Bangsamoro, in so far as regional laws are concerned. Such a law will operationalize and give flesh to the spirit of the law that sovereignty resides in the people and that all power emanates from them. IT recognizes the importance of citizen’s direct participation in the democratic processes of our region and provides a mechanism for the people to propose, amend or repeal existing laws.

This proposed bill reinforces and safeguards this power by ensuring that direct initiatives that comply with the requirements shall be directly approved by the people through a plebiscite, with no need for Parliamentary concurrence or approval. However, should the Parliament recognize the wisdom and necessity of said proposed measure, it likewise has the power to adopt in toto such proposition.

Further, this bill, much like its counterpart in national law (RA No. 6735) distinguishes between direct initiative measures -- which is the heart and soul of this proposed enactment -- and indirect initiative measures, herein called people-initiated bills. The former only needs to be approved by electors in a plebiscite, while the latter is a petition of the people to the members of the Parliament for the enactment through the regular legislative process.

This proposed bill focuses itself only to provide for a system of initiative on laws that may be passed by the Parliament of the Bangsamoro. It does not cover initiatives on ordinances at the provincial, municipal or barangay level, which may be the subject of another parliamentary act, or otherwise remain to be within the coverage of RA No. 6735.

In view of some concerns regarding the cost of mounting a plebiscite, this bill proposes to synchronize all plebiscites for initiative measures with regular elections in the Bangsamoro. Thus the plebiscite questions on initiative, called the ballot measure, is voted on using the same ballot as the one to be used for the election of elected officials in the Parliament. Aside from minimizing costs, this will also have the effect of normalizing plebiscites for important matters affecting our constituency, and thus strengthening our democracy.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought. #
