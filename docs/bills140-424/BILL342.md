**Explanatory Note**

Section 2, Article IV of Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), states that in exercising its right to self-governance, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is free to pursue its political, economic, social, and cultural development as provided in the Organic Law.

As mentioned in Section 2 (qq), Article V of the BOL, subject to Section 20, Article X of the Constitution and the Organic Law, the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise its authority over public works and infrastructure in the Bangsamoro region without prejudice to the general supervision of the President of the Republic of the Philippines.

Furthermore, Section 3 of the same article provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants.

The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) represents a significant milestone in the history of the Philippines, embodying the aspirations for self-governance, peace, and prosperity for the Bangsamoro people.

Despite its rich natural resources, cultural heritage, and strategic location, the Bangsamoro region has faced decades of underdevelopment and conflict, resulting in limited access to basic services, inadequate infrastructure, and weak connectivity. These challenges have hampered the region's potential for economic growth, poverty reduction, and improved quality of life for its residents. There is an urgent need to develop infrastructure that supports transportation, communication, energy, water, and sanitation systems to drive inclusive growth and bridge the development gap between BARMM and the rest of the Philippines.

To realize this vision, it is essential to address the long-standing issues of inadequate infrastructure, limited connectivity, and underdeveloped transportation networks that have constrained the region's socio-economic growth.

The promotion of infrastructure and connectivity development in the Bangsamoro region, as proposed in this bill, aims to address these challenges by establishing a robust infrastructure development strategy aligned with the Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP) and the priorities of the national government. By investing in infrastructure and enhancing connectivity, this measure seeks to create an enabling environment for economic activities, facilitate access to essential services, and improve living conditions in BARMM.

The Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA), as the interim government of the Bangsamoro autonomous region, has the mandate to legislate measures that promote the general welfare of its constituents.

The Bangsamoro Infrastructure and Connectivity Development Act of 2024 is a transformative piece of legislation designed to address the pressing need for infrastructure development and improved connectivity in BARMM. By providing a legal framework for coordinated infrastructure planning, investment, and implementation, this Act will contribute significantly to the region's socio-economic progress, peacebuilding efforts, and sustainable development.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
