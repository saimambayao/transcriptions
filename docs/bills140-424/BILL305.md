**AN ACT ESTABLISHING THE WASTE WORKERS’ HEALTH AND WELFARE PROGRAM FOR BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREOF**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

As mandated by the Constitution, labor is entitled to security of tenure, humane conditions of work, and a living wage.¹ Furthermore, Section 1 of the Labor Code states that:

> “State shall afford protection to labor, promote full employment, ensure equal work opportunities regardless of sex, race or creed and regulate the relations between workers and employers. The State shall assure the rights of workers to self-organization, collective bargaining, security of tenure, and just and humane conditions of work.”

Waste workers play a vital role in keeping our communities clean and safe. They undertake tasks such as waste collection, segregation, and resource recovery, contributing to environmental protection by diverting recyclable materials from landfills. Despite their indispensable contributions, waste workers face significant challenges. Research indicates that they are among the lowest-paid workers in the Philippines, with some earning as little as P2,000 per month.² This disparity in pay exacerbates their economic vulnerability, especially in regions like the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).

Moreover, waste workers are exposed to various health hazards due to direct contact with waste materials. Studies have documented a range of health issues among waste workers, including musculoskeletal problems, ocular trauma, skin diseases, and gastrointestinal disorders. Those working in incinerator plants are particularly susceptible to exposure to toxic substances like heavy metals and dioxins.³

To address these challenges comprehensively, the proposed legislation aims to establish the Waste Workers’ Health and Welfare Program. This legislation prioritizes the well-being of waste workers by ensuring access to healthcare, protective equipment, and occupational safety training. Additionally, this legislation provides avenues for waste workers to seek educational and financial support, thereby empowering them to improve their livelihoods and economic security.

It is critical for this society to acknowledge the significant sacrifices made by waste workers and take decisive action to improve their conditions. The passage of this legislation serves as a demonstration of our appreciation for their tireless efforts and signifies our commitment to fostering a fairer and more just society.

For the foregoing reasons, the passage of this bill is highly urged.
