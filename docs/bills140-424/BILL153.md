**AN ACT INSTITUTING A BANGSAMORO FREE LUNCH PROGRAM TO ALL KINDERGARTEN AND ELEMENTARY STUDENTS ENROLLED IN ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES¹**

**Explanatory Note**

Article 2, Section 15 of the 1987 Constitution provides that, the State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. The same was reiterated in Section 2, Article IX of R.A. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), which also states that the Bangsamoro Government shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. Albeit in further detail, the article also states that the Government shall also uphold the peoples’ right to have access to essential goods health, and other social services that promote their well-being. Essentially, both articles are paramount in emphasizing the importance given to health, and the state’s responsibility of its promotion, and ensure the public’s access to it.

Despite continued economic progress, malnutrition persists in the Philippines. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines malnutrition as “deficiencies or excesses in nutrient intake, imbalance of essential nutrients or impaired nutrient utilization”², which “addresses three broad groups of conditions: (1) undernutrition, which includes wasting (low weight-for-height), stunting (low height-for-age), and underweight (low weight-for-age); (2) micronutrient-related malnutrition, which includes micronutrient deficiencies (a lack of important vitamins and minerals) or micronutrient excess; and (3) overweight, obesity, and diet-related noncommunicable diseases (such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some cancers)”³.

In the Philippine context, the United Nations Children’s Fund claims that 95 Filipino children die from malnutrition every day.⁴ The WHO also finds that “despite substantial economic growth, the prevalence of wasting in the Philippines consistently increased from 2003-2013”⁵. A relatively more recent study by the World Bank supports these findings: micronutrient undernutrition is highly prevalent in the country and, in 2019, one in three (29%) children under the age of five is stunted.⁶ According to the same institution, poverty is one of the main causes of undernutrition, with almost half (42.4%) of stunted children coming from poor households. Ultimately, malnutrition continues to afflict Filipino children.

There are regional variations for malnutrition. The World Bank in the aforementioned study states that the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) has the highest rate of stunting in the country: one in two (45%) children below five is stunted. The United Nations Children’s Fund corroborates this finding.⁷ According to the organization, one in two children in the region is malnourished. It also asserts that “Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) is a serious child health problem especially in the BARMM where remoteness and poverty make access to basic health and nutrition services difficult”. Lastly, the institution contends that the “COVID-19 pandemic has made the situation worse, as children miss out on health and nutrition services due to severely limited outreach to remote barangays, made even further difficult by restrictions on movement within the region. Strict community quarantines have led to job loss and less income for already poverty-stricken families”. Thus, Bangsamoro children are particularly vulnerable to malnutrition.

Health and education are directly proportional and interrelated. The academic performance of a student relies heavily on their quality of health. Students who are sick cannot fully develop their potential, which hinders their capacity to learn at school. Improving the health condition of the students is correlational to improving their learning capacity, and as an effect, will significantly improve their academic performance. If the problem on malnutrition and hunger is addressed, then the learning capacities of the students can be maximized.

According to the World Bank, “a Filipino child with optimal nutrition will have greater cognitive development, be willing to stay in school longer, learn more in school, and have a brighter future as an adult, while undernutrition robs other children of their chance to succeed”⁸. The impact of malnutrition on education cannot be overstated in the context of the Bangsamoro, as according to the 2019 Functional Literacy, Education, Mass Media Survey of the Philippine Statistics Authority, the BARMM has the lowest rate of functional literacy (71.6%) in the country.⁹

Given the twin problems of high malnutrition and low literacy, it is imperative for the Bangsamoro Government to create a free lunch program for kindergarten and elementary students in public schools in the Bangsamoro region through a close partnership between the Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education (MBHTE) and the Ministry of Health (MoH).

The free lunch program, as proposed in this measure, envisions to serve as a protection mechanism for the underprivileged students who by reason of economic conditions in their family, are deprived of proper and nutritious food elements required for their optimum development. This shall reduce the burden of families of sending their children to school, while maximizing the abilities of the students to learn

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
