**AN ACT PROVIDING GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE TO STUDENTS AND TEACHERS IN MADARIS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM), APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES¹**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Section 22, Article II of the 1987 Constitution states that the State recognizes and promotes the rights of indigenous cultural communities within the framework of national unity and development.

Section 1, Article XIV of the Constitution further states that the State has a duty to promote and make quality education accessible to all Filipino citizens in accordance with the Constitution's mandate. Section 2 of the same article states that the State shall establish, maintain and support a complete, adequate, and integrated system of education relevant to the needs of the people and society. The state shall also encourage non-formal, informal, and indigenous learning systems, as well as self- learning, independent, and out-of-school study programs particularly those that respond to community needs.

Section 18, Article IX of R.A. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall “establish and maintain Madaris education within the Bangsamoro. It shall ensure the integration in its elementary and high school education curriculum the teaching of Islamic and Arabic studies for Muslim pupils and students in public schools. The Bangsamoro Parliament shall enact legislation for the strengthening and development of Madaris educational system in the Bangsamoro”.

The Bangsamoro Government has a pivotal role in strengthening and developing the Madaris Educational System. As of today, the Bangsamoro Parliament continues to introduce new measures and legislation to attempt to alleviate *Madrasahs*.

From the age of colonialism to the current Philippine administration, the history of the Philippines is a story of struggle for the majority of Muslim Filipinos. Today, the narrative concerning Muslim Filipinos depicts their culture to have remained insular and traditional to this day. Currently, most of Islamic educational schools, known as the traditional *madrasah* system, are operated through volunteerism. These schools are run by a families, groups or organizations that have decided to give back to the community by providing such services for free. The *Madrasahs* are a self-contained system that are not formally registered with the Department of Education. As a result, the *Madrasahs* do not possess standardized or uniform curriculums. Despite these constraints and limitations, the Madrasah system continues to function and operate independently, demonstrating the Muslim community's great desire for their children to attain Islamic education.²

The national government only recognizes non-Madrasah educational institutions as the primary beneficiary of educational funding from the government. Many laws have been created to provide scholarship grants, student loan programs, subsidies, and other incentives to students and teachers of non-Madrasah educational institutions. Therefore, Madrasah Educational Institutions have been mostly neglected by the government. The government's current policies continue to not recognize the struggles of these unrecognized institutions, significantly, the financial stress of the gurus and administrators of the *Madrasahs*. Today, Madrasah institutions only survive through donations they receive. However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has consequently began the gradual depletion of these donations. As a result, the *Madrasahs* have not been able to pay the salaries of their gurus. No government support has been provided despite the dire financial situation. Nevertheless, such obstacles and problems have persisted the Madaris long before the pandemic.

According to 2003 International Religious Freedom Report released by the United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (DRL), there are at least 1,569 Islamic Schools (*madrasahs*) across the Philippines. Within these schools, over 53% are in the former Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). The report also reveals that there are over 1,140 *madrasahs* seeking financial assistance from both local and foreign donors that are registered with the Office on Muslim Affairs (OMA), while only 35 are registered with the Department of Education (DepEd). Overall, these circumstances are primarily caused by the inability of the *madrasahs* to meet the Department of Education's accreditation standards for curricula and adequate facilities. The lack of support and regulation of the *Madaris* institutions have also affected the living standards of the majority in the BARMM communities.

Several educators and policymakers have proposed that the integration of Islamic knowledge and values into secular education is one of the alternative methods to attempt and resolve religious and cultural contentions in the current education system. However, many teachers and young Muslim learners face a very perplexing and sensitive situation regarding the teaching and integration of Islamic knowledge and values integrated into the national curriculum's secular academic subjects.

Arsad (2011) notes that duality “underscores the fact that state education is not relevant to the specific educational needs of Muslims, a factor that could explain their underproductive participation in the Philippine society (p. 1).”³ Hence, the integration of Islamic or religious subjects in non-Madrasah educational institutions or secular education is not the best method to inculcate Muslim students to the importance of Islamic education. Additionally, most students enrolled in Madaris institutions are not at the simultaneously enrolled in non-Madaris schools.

However, even with inadequate support from Philippine public schools wherein Islamic education is integrated, and with minor regard to Muslim's culture and traditions, parents still often send their children to Madaris during weekends to sustain their traditional Muslim identity (Marasigan, 2019, p. 5), of which is likely the finance to do so is taken from their own earnings.

Both the Philippine Constitution and the BOL contain provisions that recognize Islamic education – yet the quality of education in Islamic institutions or Madaris has been depicted to be very poor. The objective of the Bangsamoro Government to create a foundation for life-long learning and service to the public good and to prioritize education, among other things, to foster nationalism and patriotism, are not yet given enough consideration and priority.

The provision of financial assistance to students and teachers in Madaris, as proposed in this measure, is a way of achieving the national objective of providing quality education to all Filipinos while acknowledging Islamic education as a fundamental right of all Filipino Muslims. The Bangsamoro Government can further ensure that every Filipino Muslim learner has a legal right to receive support from the government in his or her pursuit of Islamic education.

In addition, this bill seeks to specify the role of the Bangsamoro government in providing financial assistance to students and teachers of Islamic educational institutions to improve the quality of their learning and teaching, respectively.

In view of the foregoing considerations, approval of this bill is earnestly sought.
