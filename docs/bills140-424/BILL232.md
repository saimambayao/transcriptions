**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

No less than the Constitution provides that: “The maintenance of peace and order, the protection of life, liberty, and property, and the promotion of the general welfare are essential for the enjoyment by all the people of the blessings of democracy”. On the other hand, the Bangsamoro Organic Law provide also that: “The Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants”.

Public roads and bridges are supposed to be enjoyed equally by the masses. Only the authorized government agencies may regulate their uses. Unfortunately, private persons are usurping parts of public roads and bridges by building humps or obstacles across roads, dredging new canals or waterways, putting stones, serving the roads as solar driers for grains and other goods, or even appropriating them for their exclusive commercial uses by reserving parts of the public roads as parking spaces for the customers. This practice should be stopped because it is not only prejudicial to the public but poses danger or risk to the public especially motorists. Hence, enactment of law to address this problem is urgently needed. In the words of the supreme court,

public roads being public properties cannot be sold nor leased. Doing so is void. Moreover, it is violative of the Constitution, the BOL, and other laws.

More than safety to motorists, unlawful constructions or obstructions in public roads and bridges also delays emergency responses like transportation of patients, military and police operations, fire protection or prevention response, disasters and many more. This is a high time to inculcate discipline to the people and reform their mind-setting that there is a government authorize to study and implement regulation of roads and bridges.
