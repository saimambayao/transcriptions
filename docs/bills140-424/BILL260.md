**AN ACT**
**IMPLEMENTING AGRICULTURAL MODERNIZATION STRATEGIES IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO TO EMPOWER FARMERS AND PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE AGRIBUSINESS GROWTH, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region boasts extensive expanses of land dedicated to cultivating a wide array of crops, ranging from staples like rice and cassava to valuable commodities like coffee and rubber trees. Notably, it maintains its position as the foremost producer of cassava, maize, and seaweed.

Despite its abundant water resources, fertile soil, and ideal climate for agriculture, the region has grappled with a sluggish economic pace. Challenges include the prohibitive costs of farming inputs, a gradual adoption of modern and efficient technologies, limited infrastructure for crop production and post-harvest processing, and the modest ability of farmers to cultivate high-value crops.

This limited scale often hinders the region from fully tapping into its natural resources and competitive advantages. The government should capitalize on existing capabilities and establish an all-encompassing process for production, consolidation, value enhancement, and marketing. This will bridge the divide between technology, finance, production, and the market.

To address these issues and promote sustainable growth, this measure is hereby introduced which is designed to serve as a comprehensive framework for revitalizing and modernizing the agricultural sector in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. It aims to address issues related to access to capital, technology, education, and agribusiness support, thereby aspiring to empower farmers and fisher folks in the region and foster economic growth and resilience.

This is consistent with the Bangsamoro Organic Law which mandates the regional government to advance agriculture as a key development strategy, promote productivity measures, and provide support for small farmers, landholders, and marginal fisherfolk.

Through this measure, the Author aspires to revitalize an industry that has been the backbone of our regional economy for generations. In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.

**Section 2. Declaration of Policy.** – It is hereby declared the policy of the Bangsamoro Government to advance agriculture as a key development strategy, promote productivity measures, and provide support for small farmers, landholders, and marginal fisherfolk.

It affirms its commitment to the principles of inclusivity, sustainability, and innovation in the pursuit of agricultural modernization, with the ultimate aim of improving the well-being of farmers, ensuring food security, and driving economic growth in the region.

Toward this end, it shall provide comprehensive support to farmers to improve their agricultural practices and income, facilitate the transition to sustainable farming methods, and ensure that marginalized and vulnerable groups within the farming community have equitable access to resources and opportunities.

**Section 3. Agricultural Support Programs.** – The Bangsamoro Government, through the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Agrarian Reform (MAFAR), shall establish and fund comprehensive agricultural support programs to enhance the access of farmers and fisherfolk to capital, technology, training, including, but not limited to:

The Agriculture and Fisheries Financing System shall be designed to facilitate improved access to credit by providing loan guarantees. This system shall incentivize participating financial institutions to offer loans with favorable terms and lower interest rates, longer repayment periods, and flexible payment schedules, thus reducing the financial burden on agricultural stakeholders.

Towards this end, banking institutions are expected to design and offer financial products and services that suit the specific requirements of their agricultural clients, taking into account their cash flows and the gestation and harvest period of the agricultural produce/activity/project being financed.

**Section 5. Loan Guarantee Mechanism.** – Under the system, the Bangsamoro Government, through the MAFAR, shall provide a guarantee for a portion of loans issued by participating financial institutions. The guarantee will typically cover a significant percentage of the loan principal, reducing the risk for lenders and enabling them to offer loans at lower interest rates.

Loans secured through this system can be used for various agricultural and fisheries purposes, including but not limited to:

A. Acquisition of modern farming equipment and machinery;
B. Expansion and development of agricultural and fisheries infrastructure;
C. Implementation of sustainable farming and fisheries practices and technology adoption; and
D. Working capital needs, such as purchasing seeds, fertilizers, and animal feeds.

**TRAINING AND EDUCATION**

Training curricula will be developed in consultation with agricultural experts, research institutions, and farmer and fisher folk cooperatives. These will likewise incorporate practical workshops where beneficiaries can gain hands-on experience through demonstrations of modern farming equipment, techniques, and sustainable practices.

**AGRIBUSINESS DEVELOPMENT**

**Section 7. Establishment of Agribusiness Incubation Centers.** – Agribusiness incubation centers will be established to assist farmers and fisher folk in value addition, quality control, product packaging, and marketing. These centers will offer expertise, shared facilities, including processing units, storage, and packaging equipment and resources to help beneficiaries develop and market their products effectively.

Efforts shall likewise be made to identify export opportunities and develop strategies to ensure the beneficiaries can access these markets profitably. Regular market research will be conducted to identify consumer demands, market trends, and potential export opportunities.

**Section 8. Market Access Platforms.** – The MAFAR shall implement initiatives to establish strong connections between farmers and fisherfolk, and international markets. For this purpose, it shall establish online and physical platforms to facilitate the direct connection of farmers and agribusinesses with consumers, retailers, and wholesalers. These platforms shall allow for efficient and transparent transactions.

Securing export requirements, regulations, and certifications shall be facilitated by the centers to ensure compliance with overseas market standards.

**Section 9. Professionalization of Support Programs.** – The Bangsamoro Government shall support the development and professionalization of the agricultural support programs created pursuant to this Act by providing the necessary compensation and benefits to various support program workers based on their duties, responsibilities, and qualifications. For this purpose, the MAFAR, in coordination with the Bangsamoro Civil Service Commission, shall develop qualification standards for the various managerial, technical, and non-technical positions of the agricultural support programs in the region.

**Section 10. Implementing Rules and Regulations.** – The MAFAR, in consultation with the agricultural and fisheries stakeholders, shall issue the rules and regulations necessary for the proper implementation of this Act within six (6) months from its effectivity.
