**AN ACT**
**BANNING THE SALE AND USE OF FIRECRACKERS AND OTHER PYROTECHNIC DEVICES IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM), PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**Explanatory Note**

Section 5, Article II of the 1987 Constitution states that, “the maintenance of peace and order, the protection of life, liberty, and property, and promotion of general welfare are essential for the enjoyment by all the people of the blessings of democracy.”

Moreover, Section 3, Article V of Republic Act No. 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), states that, “the Bangsamoro Government shall exercise the power expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance and those which are essential to the promotion of general welfare. Within its territorial jurisdiction, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among its residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants.”

Illegal firecrackers are a common sight during national festivities, particularly around Christmas and New Year’s Eve. More often than not, the improper, unsupervised, and unregulated use of these firecrackers results to numerous individuals suffering unfortunate, unintended, and irresponsible injuries.

There have been several laws and regulations enacted to regulate the sale, manufacture, distribution, and use of firecrackers and other pyrotechnic devices, such as Republic Act No. 7183, and Executive Order No. 28, s. 2017. And, although these have been passed into law, there continues to be a substantial number of firecracker related injuries, even casualties, as recorded every year.

The total number of fireworks-related injuries (FWRIs) in 2023 reached 609, or a 98 percent increase from the 307 in 2022, based on the final bulletin of the Department of Health (DOH)¹. Moreover, as of January 2, 2024, a total of 442 FWRIs were reported.²

More significantly, using firecrackers harms our body in both major and negative ways. By and large, burning fireworks generates a lot of air pollutants, particularly sulfur dioxide (SO₂), carbon dioxide (CO₂), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter (PM) along with several metal salts, for example aluminum, manganese, and cadmium. The negative effects of urban air pollution on human health, both in the short and long term, are becoming more well acknowledged and understood. Adults exposed to high levels of ambient air pollution have shown increased prevalence of chronic cough, phlegm, and breathlessness, and are therefore at an increased risk of developing respiratory symptoms, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), allergic rhinitis, lower respiratory tract infections, and lung cancers.³

In a measurement report of the firework impacts on the air quality in Metro Manila during the 2019 New Year Revelry prepared by Genevieve Rose Lorenzo et al., it was stated that the firework activities caused significant enhancement of particulate matter (PM₂.₅), reaching a maximum of 383.9 µg m⁻³ between 01:00 and 02:00 on 1 January 2019. Thus, Fireworks caused unhealthy levels of PM₂.₅ that exceeded the Philippine (50.0 µg m⁻³), US (35.0 µg m⁻³), and World Health Organization (WHO, 25.0 µg m⁻³) standards for PM₂.₅ over 24 h. The brief but sharply enhanced concentrations of water-soluble species in the submicrometer size range have implications for both public health and the environment, since smaller particles can penetrate more deeply into the human respiratory system, and the presence of air pollutants and several metal salts can have long-term effects for the environment.

With this in mind, along with the global calls for Sustainable Development and the protection of the environment, it is only right for us to act. The temporary enjoyment of fireworks cannot outweigh the grave consequences it may possibly cause the Bangsamoro people.

The ban on the use of firecrackers and other pyrotechnic devices in the Bangsamoro region, as proposed in this measure, can help provide an orderly, alternative, safe, and peaceful celebration of events without risk of injury or death to public.

The Bangsamoro Transition Authority, as the interim government of the Bangsamoro Region, has the mandate of protecting the general welfare of every Bangsamoro. In view of the alarming number of fireworks-related injuries sustained every year, it is of best interest to enact a bill that bans the sale, and most especially, the use of fireworks and other pyrotechnic devices in the region.

In view of the foregoing, the approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
