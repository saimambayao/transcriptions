**AN ACT**
**PROVIDING FOR THE UPGRADE AND MODERNIZATION OF THE COTABATO AIRPORT IN DATU ODIN SINSUAT, MAGUINDANAO DEL NORTE, ENHANCING ITS INFRASTRUCTURE, PROMOTING REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**Explanatory Note**

The right to travel is a constitutionally protected right under Section 6, Article III of the 1987 Philippine Constitution. It is a fundamental liberty that ranks high in constitutional values. A citizen's right to travel may not be deprived without due process of law and only on grounds of national security, public health, or public safety.¹

Infrastructure development is essential to the socio-economic growth, prosperity, and peace-building efforts in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).

The Cotabato Airport (Awang Airport), located in Datu Odin Sinsuat, Maguindanao del Norte—about eight (8) kilometers from Cotabato City, BARMM's temporary regional center—is the region's only Class 1 major domestic airport.²

*   Passenger traffic reached nearly 300,000 in 2018 and rebounded to 295,801 in 2022 after the pandemic, reflecting an 83% increase from 2021 to 2022.³

*   The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) classifies Cotabato Airport as a "major domestic airport," serving surrounding provinces and cities including Maguindanao del Norte, Maguindanao del Sur, North Cotabato, Lanao del Sur, and Sultan Kudarat.⁴

Under Section 3, Article V of Republic Act No. 11054 (Bangsamoro Organic Law or BOL), the Bangsamoro Government is empowered to exercise all duties necessary for effective governance and the promotion of general welfare—including public transportation infrastructure.⁵

Section 37, Article XIII of the BOL provides that "The National Government shall fund and implement the construction and maintenance of national roads, bridges, water supply and services, and flood control and irrigation systems, and the maintenance of existing airports, seaports, and wharves in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region."⁶

Section 38, Article XIII authorizes the Bangsamoro Government to issue regional franchises, licenses, and permits for land, sea, and air transport within its jurisdiction, while Section 2 mandates economic development and full employment.⁷

On June 22, 2023, Cotabato Airport was temporarily closed for runway overlay and terminal rehabilitation. Of the 100-day shutdown period, military and private flights resumed on August 19, and commercial operations fully reopened on October 1, 2023.⁸ During closure, BARMM residents had to travel to Davao or General Santos airports, significantly increasing travel time and costs.

The reopening was met with immediate positive impact. The Bangsamoro Business Council reported that the return of commercial flights boosted business and tourism in BARMM.⁹ Regional media noted improved investor confidence and the establishment of satellite offices of regulatory bodies at the airport.¹⁰

City-level data further underscore the airport's strategic importance: Cotabato City recorded ₱1.2 billion in new investments and a 10.5% annual growth rate between 2014–2019, with 2022 GDP at ₱72 billion (~₱221,766 per capita).¹¹ BARMM, meanwhile, posted a 7.5% regional growth rate in 2021—the second-fastest in the country following major peace and infrastructure initiatives.¹²

The proposed measure is also consistent with the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2023–2028 and the Bangsamoro Development Plan 2023–2028, which both emphasize infrastructure connectivity as a critical foundation for inclusive growth and national integration.¹³

Modernizing the Cotabato Airport will also enhance the region's disaster resilience. As a strategic logistics hub, it can facilitate emergency response operations during armed conflict, natural disasters, or humanitarian crises.¹⁴

The proposal is strongly backed by local government units, the business sector, and civil society organizations who view the airport as vital to regional progress. It is expected to generate employment in construction, aviation, logistics, and tourism, while stimulating local entrepreneurship.¹⁵

Moreover, improved air connectivity is essential in reinforcing the gains of peace and normalization, ensuring that all communities—especially those transitioning from conflict—have equitable access to mobility, services, and opportunities.¹⁶

Finally, the proposed upgrade is a sound investment: it will reduce logistics costs, expand market access for BARMM products, and increase investor confidence—thereby boosting local revenues and economic competitiveness.¹⁷

In view of the foregoing data and compelling need, the immediate enactment of this bill is earnestly urged.
