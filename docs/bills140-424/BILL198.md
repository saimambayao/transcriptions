**AN ACT GRANTING CASH INCENTIVES TO BANGSAMORO TOPNOTCHERS OF BAR AND BOARD EXAMINATIONS AND WINNERS OF INTERNATIONAL SPORTS, SKILLS AND ACADEMIC COMPETITIONS, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Highlighting the achievement of exemplary Bangsamoro individuals is a great motivator for them to keep up the good work. Moreover, such recognition can also inspire their fellow Bangsamoro to volunteer and excel. When we highlight the achievement of our people, we fuel their economic and social progress which ultimately strengthens our community. Sometimes it only takes a little spark for us to take the extra steps necessary to achieve our goals. If we highlight enough little sparks, we can start a roaring bonfire of achievement.

The Bangsamoro government has been actively recognizing individuals and organizations for their various remarkable achievements. This has been manifested through several resolutions enacted by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament. However, the Bangsamoro Government should undertake to provide greater support to our students and athletes to further develop excellence and sporting cultures in the Bangsamoro autonomous region. This Bill can help serve to meet these objectives as it seeks to institutionalize the grant of cash incentives to exemplary Bangsamoro who excel in academic, and major sports and skills competitions.

Indeed, topping the Bar and PRC Board exams or clinching a spot in an international academics, sports or skills competition is not an easy feat and therefore Bangsamoro individuals who are able to excel in these fields deserve rewards from the regional government as they also bring glory and pride to the homeland.

In view of the foregoing, this representation earnestly seeks the enactment of this Bill.
