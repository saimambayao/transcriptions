**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Section 12, Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law mandates the Bangsamoro Parliament to enact the necessary laws to uphold and protect the fundamental rights of women. The Bangsamoro Government is likewise obliged to "respect and adhere to all international treaties and agreements binding upon the National Government."

This bill has been drafted in consideration of existing laws and treaty obligations recognizing and upholding the rights of women deprived of liberty.

¹ Sec. 30, Chapter V of RA 9710 defines "*Women in Especially Difficult Circumstances*" shall refer to victims and survivors of sexual and physical abuse, illegal recruitment, prostitution, trafficking, armed conflict, women in detention, victims and survivors of rape and incest, and such other related circumstances which have incapacitated them functionally.

Republic Act No. 9710 or otherwise known as "*The Magna Carta of Women*" is the comprehensive women's human rights law that seeks to provide protection and promotion of the rights of Filipino women particularly those belonging to marginalized sector of the community following the principle that the state values the dignity of every human person and guarantees full respect for human rights. The said law provides important services for Women in Especially Difficult Circumstances (WEDC)¹ which includes good health services, proper sanitation and separate facilities for women in detention or correctional facilities. Meanwhile, this proposed Women Deprived of Liberty in the Bangsamoro Region Act of 2024 seeks to address the unique needs and vulnerabilities of women deprived of liberty within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. It aims to uphold their dignity, ensure their humane treatment, and provide them with appropriate support and interventions.

Moreover, this legislative measure seeks to institutionalize reforms in the treatment of women deprived of liberty by a faithful compliance to the international obligations by providing important provisions that affect the rights and lives of pregnant and nursing women deprived of liberty and their children.

The drafting of this piece of legislation was guided by the "Nelson Mandela Rules" or the United Nations (UN) Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners which requires the establishing of women's institutions "special accommodation for all necessary pre-natal and post-natal care and treatment. The same rule also advocates for the non-custodial sentences for pregnant women and women with dependent children being preferred.

This measure likewise adopts, among others, the "Bangkok Rules" or the United Nations Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-Custodial Measures for Women Offenders. The rule recognizes that the regime of prison be flexible enough to respond to the needs of women deprived of liberty, especially pregnant women, nursing mothers and women with children.

Both the Nelson Mandela Rules and the Bangkok Rules have been adopted by the UN General Assembly.

This bill is grounded in international human rights standards and Islamic principles, reflecting the Bangsamoro Government's commitment to the protection and welfare of all its citizens, especially the marginalized and vulnerable.

In Islam, the principle of gender equality is firmly established. Women are deeply respected and valued with their roles and contributions being vital to the cohesive functioning of society. This bill is based on Islamic principles of upholding the dignity of women and treating them with honor and respect. The religious freedom and cultural sensitivity of Muslim women are recognized.

This measure hopes to be the catalyst that will shed light on the women deprived of liberty, especially children born to mothers deprived of liberty, to live and survive with a better implementation of rules, policies, and programs inside the jail, detention, or correctional facilities.

In view of the foregoing, approval of this measure is earnestly sought.
