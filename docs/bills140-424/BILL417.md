**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) is established pursuant to the Republic Act No. 7722. CHED is the government agency responsible for overseeing tertiary and graduate education, with a mandate to ensure quality, relevance, and accessibility. Its role includes formulating policies, setting minimum standards for programs and institutions, and monitoring their performance to meet national development goals. CHED also promotes and supports academic freedom, research, and the development of higher-level professionals.

Higher education shall be given paramount concentration as this education stage plays a significant role for each citizen in preparation for their respective field of professional career.

The bill seeks to create the Commission on Higher Education in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao as mandated in Article IX, Sections 16-20 of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the *Bangsamoro Organic Law.*

The creation of the Bangsamoro Commission on Higher Education (BCHED) aims to have a stand-alone office in the Bangsamoro Region, which ensures that quality higher education is accessible to all Bangsamoro people, and all Bangsamoro graduates and professionals are globally competitive.

Under this Bill, the BCHED shall be established as a separate agency of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) and is under the Office of the Chief Minister of the Bangsamoro Government. It shall be established similarly to the national government, where the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) is separate and distinct from the Department of Education (DepEd) and is directly under the Office of the President. The relationship to the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education created pursuant to Article XVI Section 8 of Republic Act No. 11054 shall be purely coordination on issues and concerns regarding higher education.

The BCHED shall be the representative of the BARMM to the CHED national government, UniFAST Governing Board, and Private Education Assistance Committee (PEAC) pursuant to the representation of BARMM agencies to the national line agencies as contemplated under Art. VI, Sec. 11 of Republic Act No. 11054.

The BCHED shall supervise and regulate private schools, including sectarian and nonsectarian institutions of higher education. Any school, college, or university existing in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region shall be deemed an integral component of the educational system of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region and shall be governed by the respective charters.

Jurisdiction over MBHTE-supervised or non-chartered state-supported post-secondary degree-granting institutions shall be transferred to the Bangsamoro Commission on Higher Education.

In accordance with Article XVI, Section 10 of Republic Act No. 11054 stating that “Employees in the sectors of health, education, and social welfare shall be absorbed and transferred to the Bangsamoro Government,” the personnel, properties, assets and liabilities, functions and responsibilities of the MBHTE’s Higher Education, including those for higher and tertiary education, and other existing BARMM entities having similar functions are hereby transferred to this Bangsamoro Commission on Higher Education.

The Commission shall also have jurisdiction over local colleges and universities under its territorial jurisdiction, including the **BANGSAMORO REGIONAL INSTITUTE FOR HIGHER ISLAMIC STUDIES.**

The Commission shall also have jurisdiction over existing state universities and colleges under its territorial jurisdiction pursuant to the provisions of the Bangsamoro Organic Law, Republic Act No. 7722 (Higher Education Act of 1994), Republic Act No. 8292 (Higher Education Modernization Act of 1997), and existing laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to higher education.

In view of the foregoing, approval of this bill is earnestly requested.
