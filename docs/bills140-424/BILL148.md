**AN ACT CREATING THE BARMM BADJAO DEVELOPMENT PROJECT**

**Explanatory Note**

The Badjao people, also known as the sea gypsies, are one of the most vulnerable and marginalized indigenous groups in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). They have a distinct culture and a unique way of life that is closely tied to the sea, but face numerous challenges such as lack of access to basic social services, poverty, and discrimination. Consequently, without viable and sustained efforts from the regional and local governments, a significant portion of them is now in a diaspora across the country, typifies as mendicants, and largely abhorred by mainstream society for their poor health and living standards, illiteracy, with unemployable skills, early marriages and high birth rate, and so on.

The Philippine Constitution recognizes the democratic responsibility of the government to protect the rights of minorities, especially the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups. Unfortunately, the Badjao people have been historically marginalized, and their rights and welfare have not been adequately protected. How they were hurdled and mistreated by certain local governments during the pandemic is a telltale sign of how worse their lives have become and the continuing social and institutional neglect they have suffered and continue to suffer.

Recognizing this historical and contemporary injustice, this proposed legislation aims to establish the BARMM Badjao Development Project as an affirmative action by the BARMM government to correct this wrong against the Badjao people. This project seeks to promote the human security of the Badjao people by addressing their human in securities and improving their political, economic, food, health, environment, personal, and community securities.

The BARMM Badjao Development Project will have the following objectives:

1. To promote and protect the basic political and human rights of the Badjao community, including birth and citizenship registration.

2. To support the Badjao's claims for ancestral domain and the establishment of their own kampung (village) to promote and protect their marine ecology and lifestyle from commercial fishery encroachment, high sea robbery, and similar insecurities.

3. To provide capacity-building and training for the Badjao community in areas such as fishing, agriculture, handicrafts, and disaster preparedness.

4. To provide basic social services such as education, housing, and healthcare.

5. To support the establishment of livelihood projects, including small-scale fishing and agriculture, and support for traditional economic practices.

6. To protect and conserve marine ecology and lifestyle.

7. To provide basic infrastructure such as access to potable water, sanitation facilities, and electricity.

To implement the BARMM Badjao Development Project, a project management office (PMO) will be established under the Office of the Chief Minister to supervise, implement and mobilize resources within the BARMM and from other sources, like the donor community. Note: Second option is for the PMO to be lodged under the supervision of the Minister of Indigenous Affairs, but the PMO should have continued fiscal and management autonomy.

As a rough estimate, an initial, generous, annual budget allocation of at least PHP 500 million is suggested for the BARMM Badjao Development Project, which can be increased or decreased based on the needs and progress of the program.

This proposed legislation aims to promote the rights and welfare of the Badjao people and empower them to achieve sustainable development and improve their quality of life. It also fulfills the BARMM government's democratic responsibility to protect the rights of minorities and correct historical injustices. We hope that this proposed legislation will receive the support of the BTA and contribute to the overall development and progress of the BARMM.
