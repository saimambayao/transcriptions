**“AN ACT ESTABLISHING THE BULDON GENERAL HOSPITAL WITH 25 BED CAPACITY AT THE MUNICIPALITY OF BULDON, PROVINCE OF MAGUINDANAO DEL NORTE AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR”**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The 1987 Philippine Constitution, in Section 15, Article III declares that the State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. Section 11 Article XIII declares that the State shall adopt an integrated and comprehensive approach to health development that shall endeavor to make essential goods, health and other social services available to all the people at affordable cost.

Hospital is a place devoted primarily to the maintenance and operation of facilities for the diagnosis, treatment and care of individuals suffering from illness, disease, injury or deformity, or in need of obstetrical or other medical and nursing care. It is also the place where there are installed beds, or cribs, or bassinets for twenty-four-hour use or longer by patients in the treatment of diseases, diseased-conditions, injuries, deformities, or abnormal physical and mental states, maternity cases, and all institutions such as those for convalescence, sanitarial or sanitarial care, infirmities, nurseries, dispensaries and such other names by which they may designated.

In the northern part of the first district of Maguindanao, there are six (6) Municipalities comprises of the following with its respective population based on the 2020 census of the Philippine Statistic Authority BARMM such as: Sultan Kudarat with 105,121 population, Sultan Mastura with 25,331 population, Parang with 102,914, Buldon with 39,684 population, Barira with 36,143 population and Matanog with 36,034 population or a total population of 345,227. The aforementioned Municipalities is under the areas of delivery of services of 2 hospitals namely, the Cotabato Sanitarium located at Barangay Pinaring, Sultan Kudarat Municipality and the Iranun District Hospital located at Parang Municipality with 250 and 25 bed capacity respectively or a total of 275 bed capacity.

Based on the standards set forth by the Department of Health, it provides that the ratio of bed capacity is 1 bed for every 1000 population. Applying such standards, the 275 total bed capacity of the above-mentioned hospitals can accommodate up to 275,000 populations. Given the fact that areas of delivery of services of the above-mentioned hospitals has the total population of 345,227, it is clear that there is a deficiency of at least 70 bed capacity in order to accommodate such populations. Therefore, there is a necessity of establishing a hospital that can accommodate such deficiencies in the delivery of services.

The establishment of a General Hospital with 25 bed capacity in the Municipality of Buldon may serve primarily, but not limited to, the patients coming from the municipality of Buldon but also it may serve as an augmentation and support, when such need arises, to those coming from the Municipality of Barira who will travel 22 kilometers going to such hospital instead of travelling 41 kilometers going to Cotabato Sanitarium hospital. It may also at least lessen the burden of the above-mentioned hospitals in accommodating the patients coming from the other adjacent municipalities.

In view of the above, ensuring access to basic, quality and affordable medical services for Bangsamoro people must be given priority by the BARMM government. Essentially, this can be realized by establishing an General hospitals in identified strategic areas in BARMM, such as in Buldon Maguindanao Del Norte.

Thus, in view of the foregoing, the immediate approval of this bill is earnestly sought.
