**AN ACT**
**GRANTING A ONE-TIME DEATH BENEFIT AND PERMANENT DISABILITY ASSISTANCE TO THE FAMILIES OF BARANGAY OFFICIALS AND SANGGUNIANG KABATAAN (SK) CHAIRPERSONS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO, PROVIDING FOR THE INVESTMENT OF THE FUND TO GENERATE PROFITS FOR TABARRU' PAYMENTS, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**Explanatory Note**

Barangay officials and Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) chairpersons serve as the backbone of local governance, acting as the first responders to community needs, mediators in conflicts, and implementers of national and regional policies at the grassroots level. Despite their indispensable role in maintaining peace, delivering basic services, and fostering development, they remain among the most undercompensated and undervalued public servants in our society. Unlike other government employees who receive comprehensive benefits, including life insurance, health coverage, and survivorship pensions, barangay and youth leaders—who often risk their safety and dedicate long hours to public service—are left without any substantial death benefit from the government. This glaring gap in social protection not only undermines their sacrifices but also leaves their families vulnerable to financial hardship in the event of their untimely demise.

Barangay officials and SK chairpersons operate at the forefront of governance, dealing with critical issues ranging from disaster response and health crises to peacekeeping and youth development. They are expected to perform their duties with little to no additional support, often using personal resources to fulfill their responsibilities. Tragically, when these public servants pass away or incur permanent disability—whether due to illness, accidents, or even violence in conflict-prone areas—their families are left without any form of financial assistance from the government. This is a profound injustice, considering that many of these officials serve with meager honoraria rather than fixed salaries, making it difficult for their families to cope with funeral expenses and other immediate needs.

The absence of a death and disability benefit for barangay and SK officials stands in stark contrast to the benefits provided to other government workers, creating an inequitable system where those at the grassroots level—who arguably bear the heaviest burdens—are the least protected. This lack of support not only disheartens current officials but also discourages capable individuals from taking on these essential roles, weakening local governance in the long run.

The Bangsamoro Organic Law (RA 11054) enshrines the principles of social justice, equitable development, and inclusive governance, mandating the BARMM to enact policies that uplift its constituents. Similarly, the Local Government Code (RA 7160) recognizes barangay officials as vital agents of local administration, while the SK Reform Act (RA 10742) underscores the importance of supporting youth leaders who contribute to nation-building. Despite these legal foundations, no concrete measure has been institutionalized to provide death benefits for these public servants in the Bangsamoro region.

This proposed measure seeks to rectify this oversight by establishing 1) a one-time death benefit to the bereaved families of barangay officials and SK chairpersons who die while in active service, and 2) a financial assistance to those who suffer from permanent disability while performing their duties.

This bill further institutionalizes the Barangay Officials Benefit Investment Fund (BOBIF), designed to ensure long-term sustainability through Shariah-compliant investments and risk-sharing mechanisms. Proceeds from this investment shall be used to procure *Takaful* service to manage the *tabarru'* fund intended to indemnify the covered officials who might die or sustain a permanent disability in the line of their sacred duties. This initiative is not merely an act of charity but a moral obligation—a recognition that those who dedicate their lives to public service deserve dignity in death, and that their families should not be forsaken by the very government they loyally served.

The establishment of a death and permanent disability benefit for barangay and SK officials is a matter of justice and compassion. Many of these officials work in high-risk environments, particularly in conflict-affected and geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas within the BARMM. Some have even lost their lives in the line of duty, yet their families receive no assistance from the government.

The institutionalization of this legislative measure represents the Bangsamoro Government’s commitment to honoring public service and upholding social protection, in line with Islamic principles of mutual assistance (*tabarru'*) and social justice. It not only ensures that affected families receive timely assistance but also strengthens the social contract between the government and its local officials. By institutionalizing this benefit, the Bangsamoro government can demonstrate its commitment to fair treatment and social welfare, reinforcing the principle that no public servant—regardless of rank—should be left without support.

Furthermore, this measure will serve as an incentive for more dedicated individuals to take on leadership roles in barangays and youth councils, knowing that their service is valued and that their families will be cared for in the event of tragedy. It will also strengthen trust in governance, as communities see that their leaders are not neglected by the institutions they represent.

The passage of this bill is a necessary step toward rectifying a long-standing disparity within our governance system. Barangay officials and SK chairpersons are the unsung heroes of the Bangsamoro, and it is only just that their sacrifices be met with tangible support. By granting a one-time death benefit and permanent disability assistance, the Bangsamoro Government affirms its commitment to honoring the dedicated service of barangay officials and SK chairpersons, providing meaningful support to bereaved families, and upholding the principle of equitable and compassionate treatment for all public servants.

We, therefore, urge the honorable members of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament to support this measure as a testament to our shared values of compassion, justice, and solidarity with those who serve at the grassroots. Let us ensure that no family of a fallen barangay or SK leader is left to bear their loss alone.
