**AN ACT**
**ESTABLISHING A COMPREHENSIVE REGIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE WATER SUSTAINABILITY IN THE BARMM, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Access to clean, safe, and sustainable water is not merely a necessity – it is a human right affirmed by the United Nations General Assembly (2010)¹, which recognizes the right to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation as essential to the full enjoyment of life and all human rights. From an Islamic perspective, water is a sacred gift and a fundamental right. The Qur’an declares, “And we made every living thing from water” (Qur’an 21:30), Underscoring its vital role in sustaining life. Moreover, the Prophet Muhammad emphasized equitable water access, stating: “People are partners in three things: water, pasture, and fire” (Sunan Abi Dawud 3477), which reinforces the notion that water must be shared fairly and protected for communal benefit. In the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), however, this right remains unrealized for many communities.

According to UN-Water (2021)², more than two billion people worldwide live in water-stressed countries. The Philippines, with its increasing population and vulnerability to climate change, is not exempted. In BARMM, the situation is exacerbated due to conflict, displacement, weak infrastructure, and poor governance. According to the Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority, only 33.8% of households in the region had access to safe drinking water within their premises as of 2020³, compared to a much higher national average. Although this figure has improved significantly – rising to 80.2% of the population having access to at least basic drinking water services in 2022 (Situation of Children, 2023)⁴ – BARMM still lags behind the national average of 97% (UNICEF Philippines, 2023)⁵. This persistent disparity emphasizes a persistent inequality in water access, which adversely impacts public health, education, and overall quality of life in the region. In response to this gap, the Mindanao Development Authority (MinDA) has noted that several municipalities in BARMM have over 50% of households without access to clean and accessible water, prompting targeted water infrastructure projects in collaboration with national and international stakeholders (SunStar, 2023)⁶. Clearly, such interventions are crucial in bridging the water access gap and promoting inclusive development across the region.

Compounding this water crisis is the increasing threat posed by climate change. The Philippine Climate Change Assessment (PhilCCA, 2018)⁷ highlights the country’s increased exposure to droughts, floods, and extreme weather events, all of which disrupt the availability and quality of water. BARMM is particularly vulnerable due to its geographic features – mountainous terrains, small islands, and low-income communities – and limited adaptive capacity. This vulnerability emphasizes the urgent need for climate-resilient water systems across the region.

Despite ongoing regional and national efforts aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation), significant challenges remain. In BARMM, many municipalities still rely on Level I systems, such as handpumps and open wells, which are often contaminated or dry up seasonally (National Economic and Development Authority [NEDA], 2020)⁸. Moreover, the National Water Resource Board (NWRB, 2021)⁹ has observed that the water sector in the Philippines is characterized by high institutional fragmented, with over 30 government agencies involved. This fragmentation leads to operational inefficiencies, resource duplication, and unclear lines of accountability. In the context of BARMM, these issues are further exacerbated by the region’s ongoing transition to self-governance and the absence of a dedicated, context-sensitive water sustainability framework.

In addition to governance and access issues, infrastructure deficiencies pose a significant threat to sustainable water management. As emphasized by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO, 2021),¹⁰ building resilience in water systems necessitates strategic investments in durable, well-maintained infrastructure. Unfortunately, many water facilities in BARMM are aging, poorly maintained, or have been damaged by years of conflict and recurring natural disasters and hazards. These inadequacies not only reduce service reliability and increase water losses but also restrict access to safe water for the region’s most vulnerable populations.

Furthermore, the Philippine Climate Change Commission (PCCA, 2018)¹¹ advocates for an integrative approach to water governance that integrates local knowledge with scientific and technological innovations. BARMM currently lacks a regional mechanism to facilitate this integration, resulting in fragmented planning and missed opportunities to implement sustainable, culturally appropriate water solutions. Without institutional innovation and local participation, water governance remains disconnected from the lived realities of communities in the region.

Equally important is the need for inclusive governance in addressing water insecurity. According to UN-Water (2023),¹² women, girls, and indigenous communities are disproportionately affected by water scarcity, yet their voices are seldom reflected in policy formulation and implementation. In BARMM, these groups carry the burden of water collection and bear the brunt of associated health risks. Nevertheless, they continue to be underrepresented in program design, community consultations, and decision-making processes. Thus, mainstreaming gender equality and cultural inclusion in water governance is imperative for achieving long-term sustainability and social justice in BARMM.

In light of these systemic challenges, this proposed BARMM Water Sustainability Act aims to establish a comprehensive Water Sustainability Framework that adopts collaborative governance and and long-term resilience. Central to this initiative is the creation of a Water Sustainability Board (WSB), which will institutionalize inter-ministerial and inter-local government coordination to address the complex water challenges in the region. The framework prioritizes investment in climate-resilient infrastructure in accordance with the region's diverse geographic and socio-political contexts. It also seeks to institutionalize Water Cooperatives, thereby promoting community ownership and stewardship of water systems. Recognizing the value of indigenous knowledge and scientific evidence, the measure supports partnerships with state universities, research institutions, and indigenous leaders to ensure science-based planning and culturally grounded solutions. Furthermore, the proposed framework commits to inclusive, participatory, and gender-responsive water governance in line with SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation and SDG 5: Gender Equality.

Ultimately, the enactment of the BARMM Water Sustainability Act is expected to yield transformative impacts across key development sectors. In terms of health and sanitation, improved access to safe and sufficient water will reduce the incidence of diarrhea, cholera, and other waterborne diseases, while also enhancing maternal and child health outcomes. In agriculture and food security, the provision of reliable irrigation systems will support farming and fishing-dependent communities and reduce vulnerability to crop losses caused by droughts or flooding. Environmentally, the framework will reinforce the conservation of water resources, protect critical watersheds, and build resilience against climate-induced water scarcity. Lastly, from a peacebuilding perspective, the Act can serve as a vehicle for restoring public trust and promoting social cohesion by ensuring that water service delivery is equitable, inclusive, and responsive – crucial elements in the post-conflict recovery and transition of BARMM.

All these efforts toward water sustainability are not merely matters of policy – they are sacred expressions of our shared covenant grounded in Hulah, Bangsa, and Agama. By ensuring just and equitable access to water, we fulfill our collective duty to care for our people, uphold the dignity of our culture, and embody our sacred responsibility as faithful stewards of Allah’s entrusted blessings. In doing so, we honor His trust, uplift our communities, and safeguard the sanctity of life for generations yet to come.
