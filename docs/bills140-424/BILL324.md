**Section 1. Title.** This Act shall be known as the "Environment, Culture, and Opportunity (ECO) Tourism Villages Act of BARMM."

**Section 2. Declaration of Policy.** It is the policy of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) to promote sustainable development, cultural preservation, and community engagement across its LGUs. This Act seeks to establish ECO Tourism Villages that integrate eco-friendly practices, cultural preservation, and economic opportunities, emphasizing the values of Environment, Culture, and Opportunity (ECO) for the benefit of the diverse peoples of BARMM, including but not limited to the Bajau, B'laan, Dulangan Manobo, Higaonon, Iranun, Lambangian, Maguindanaon, Maranao, Sama, Tausug, Teduray, and Yakan.

**Section 3. Objectives.** The objectives of this Act are:

1. Promote sustainable agricultural and fishing practices that align with the local environment and traditions of the various peoples of BARMM.
2. As far as practicable, foster renewable energy adoption, including solar, wind, and biogas, to support eco-friendly development across BARMM.
3. Enhance ecotourism opportunities that showcase the rich cultures, natural beauty, and heritage of the diverse peoples of BARMM.
4. Encourage the conservation of natural resources through initiatives like reforestation, coastal and marine conservation, and biodiversity protection, while respecting the traditional practices of recognized peoples across BARMM.
5. Provide tax-free incentives for 10 years to approved ECO Tourism Villages under this Act, which shall only apply to taxes or duties imposed by BARMM, to stimulate growth, investment, and sustainable economic development.

**Section 4. Establishment of ECO Tourism Villages by Private Entities.**- Corporations, cooperatives, partnerships, and sole proprietorships are allowed to participate in and establish ECO Tourism Villages under this Act, provided they register with the Ministry of Trade, Investments, and Tourism (MTIT). Sole proprietorships must be owned by a resident of the city or municipality where the ECO Tourism Village will be established. All other entities, including corporations, partnerships, and cooperatives, must be majority-owned by residents of such a city or municipality. These entities shall enjoy the same benefits as those established by the government, including the 10-year tax-free status, which applies only to taxes or duties imposed by BARMM.

**Section 5. Guidelines for Establishment of Eco-Villages.** The Ministry of Trade, Investments, and Tourism (MTIT), in collaboration with the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources, and Energy (MENRE) and the Bangsamoro Commission for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage (BCHPH), shall issue detailed guidelines for the establishment of ECO Tourism Villages. These guidelines shall be incorporated into the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) and shall include, but are not limited to:
a. Site selection criteria, ensuring that the chosen locations promote environmental sustainability and cultural preservation.
b. Infrastructure requirements that incorporate eco-friendly materials and renewable energy technologies.
c. Programs and services to be provided within the ECO Tourism Villages, including accommodations, cultural activities, and environmental conservation efforts.
d. Compliance with existing environmental, cultural, and tourism laws and regulations within BARMM.
e. Community engagement and participation in the development, management, and operation of the villages.
f. ECO Tourism Villages shall not be limited to one culture or people only; any and all cultures may be incorporated into one village.
g. Financial and operational requirements, including the funding mechanism from BARMM and partnerships with cooperatives and private entities.

**Section 6. Oversight Roles and Responsibilities.** The oversight structure for the ECO Tourism Villages shall be as follows:

a) MTIT: The Ministry of Trade, Investments, and Tourism (MTIT) shall have overall authority over the ECO Tourism Villages program. It will oversee the implementation of the Act, ensure compliance with the guidelines, and monitor the overall progress and development of ECO Tourism Villages across BARMM. MTIT will be responsible for all policy directions and coordination among stakeholders.

b) Provincial or City Boards: Each province or city shall have its own Provincial or City Board for ECO Tourism Villages. The Board shall be responsible for the local implementation of the Act, monitoring projects within their jurisdiction, and ensuring that the guidelines set forth by MTIT are followed. The Board will be chaired by the MTIT Provincial Director, with the Tourism Officer of the respective province or city and the Tourism Officer of the municipality (in the case of a province) where the ECO Tourism Village is located serving as automatic members. The Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources, and Energy (MENRE) and the Bangsamoro Commission for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage (BCHPH) shall also have automatic representation on the Provincial or City Board.

c) MENRE and BCHPH: These ministries shall provide specialized oversight within their respective domains. MENRE will ensure that the environmental sustainability goals of the ECO Tourism Villages are achieved, while BCHPH will ensure that cultural preservation and integration of heritage are maintained.

**Section 7. Dedicated Bureau for ECO Tourism Villages** - Each MTIT provincial office shall establish a dedicated window or bureau specifically tasked with managing the ECO Tourism Villages program. This bureau shall provide administrative support, streamline the registration process for private entities, and offer technical assistance to local government units and developers involved in the creation and maintenance of ECO Tourism Villages.

**Section 8. Cultural and Environmental Integration** - The ECO Tourism Villages shall prioritize cultural preservation and environmental stewardship. Traditional crafts, performances, festivals, and community activities that reflect the unique heritage of all recognized peoples of BARMM, such as the Bajau, B’laan, Dulangan Manobo, Higaonon, Iranun, Lambangian, Maguindanaon, Maranao, Sama, Tausug, Teduray and Yakan, will be encouraged. The villages may incorporate multiple cultures within one village, fostering unity in diversity. These villages will also promote environmental awareness, integrating sustainable living practices that protect and enhance the local ecosystem.

**Section 9. Funding and Incentives** - Funding for the establishment and maintenance of ECO Tourism Villages shall be sourced from the BARMM Government’s annual budget. At least 10 million pesos shall be allocated per province or city for the planning and construction of ECO Tourism Villages. However, this funding shall only be available for villages created by the government. MTIT shall ensure that within one year from the effectivity of this Act, at least one ECO Tourism Village is built in each province or city. Approved ECO Tourism Villages, whether public, cooperative, or private, shall enjoy a 10-year tax-free status from taxes or duties imposed by BARMM as a means of promoting sustainable investment and development.

**Section 10. Coordination and Assistance** - The BARMM Government, through the MTIT and other relevant ministries and agencies, shall provide technical and financial support to LGUs, registered cooperatives, and private entities in establishing and sustaining ECO Tourism Villages. Coordination with local leaders, cultural experts, and environmental organizations will ensure that development is respectful of the cultural practices of all recognized peoples and environmental goals.

**Section 11. Monitoring and Evaluation** - The MTIT, in collaboration with Provincial or City Boards, MENRE, and BCHPH, shall monitor and evaluate the progress of ECO Tourism Villages. MTIT will ensure overall program coordination and will act as the final authority in all ECO Tourism Village-related matters to streamline governance.

The regulations will ensure that the ECO Tourism Villages promote the core values of Environment, Culture, and Opportunity (ECO) while fostering economic growth and sustainability.

**Section 14. Separability Clause.** If any provision of this Act is declared invalid or unconstitutional, the other provisions not affected thereby shall remain in full force and effect.
