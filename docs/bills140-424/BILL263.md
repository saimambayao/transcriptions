**BTA BILL NO. 263**
(Private Member Bill)

The proposed Bangsamoro Electrification Administration Act of 2023 serves as a crucial and timely response to the prevailing challenges in the power sector within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). The region has long grappled with the dire consequences of an unstable power supply, which has not only hindered progress and development but has also significantly hampered the daily lives of its residents. It is paramount to underscore the dire necessity of improving rural electrification in the BARMM.

For an extended period, the people of BARMM have endured the crippling effects of inadequate and unreliable electricity access. This unremitting instability has exacted a heavy toll, affecting every facet of daily life, imposing barriers to educational opportunities, impeding access to essential healthcare services, and stifling the potential for robust economic growth. The undeniable and pressing truth is that the imperative to address these issues comprehensively and expeditiously cannot be overstated.

The legislative initiative before us is not merely a response to a local issue; it draws inspiration from the historical success of rural electrification initiatives at the national level in the Philippines. It aspires to replicate these successes within the specific jurisdiction of the BARMM. The Act, by empowering the Bangsamoro Electrification Administration (BEA) as a Government-Owned or - Controlled Corporation (GOCC), equips the region with the necessary tools and resources to promote and facilitate rural electrification, with a particular emphasis on underserved areas.

It is crucial to emphasize that rural electrification is not a mere aspiration but a fundamental necessity for the advancement of the BARMM. The region envisions fostering economic growth, improving living standards, and creating an environment conducive to investments and development. A stable and reliable power supply is not just a cornerstone of this vision; it is the very foundation upon which the BARMM can build a brighter, more prosperous, and electrified future.

Given the undeniable urgency and the transformative potential of this legislation, we strongly urge the approval of this bill. The necessity to improve rural electrification in BARMM cannot be delayed any further.

**AN ACT**

**ARTICLE I**
**Policy and Definitions**

**Sec. 1. Short Title.** This Act shall be referred to as the “Bangsamoro Electrification Administration Act of 2023.”

**Section 2. Declaration of Policy.** The total electrification of the Bangsamoro Region on an area coverage basis is vital to the attainment of equitable and sustainable development in order to promote and improve the quality of life of its inhabitants in the Bangsamoro Region. Towards this end, it shall be the policy of the Bangsamoro Government to pursue and foster the attainment of this objective. For this purpose, the Bangsamoro Government shall promote, encourage, and assist all public service entities engaged in supplying electric service, particularly electric cooperatives, which are willing to pursue diligently this objective.

Due to their non-profit nature, cooperative ethos, and the significant financial challenges they must overcome to establish themselves and achieve operational viability, electric cooperatives deserve substantial support and assistance from the Bangsamoro Government to the greatest extent possible. Given their inherent self-regulating characteristics and the comprehensive regulatory framework established by Congress, which covers all aspects of their organization and operation, and in order to further encourage and promote their development, they should be subject to minimal regulation by other administrative agencies.
