**AN ACT MANDATING THE CREATION OF BARANGAY JUSTICE SYSTEM MULTISECTORAL TRADITIONAL AND CUSTOMARY LAWS ADVISORY COUNCIL**

**EXPLANATORY NOTES**

Republic Act 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991 expanded the scope and powers of the Katarungang Pambarangay or the Barangay Justice System, designed not merely to decongest the courts of cases but to address inequalities in access to justice, particularly experienced by marginalized communities. The barangays, being the basic political unit in the country, are in the most strategic position to facilitate the resolution or mediation of community and family disputes, alongside its mandate to deliver basic services.¹

Based on a report submitted by the Bureau of Local Government Supervision in 2014, the government estimated savings of P3,107,678,000 were determined as a result of the out-of-court settlement of a total of 327,124 disputes lodged before barangay lupons or lupong tagapamayapa throughout the country. The estimated government cost of adjudication per case is P9,500, according to the Supreme Court.²

RA 7160 explicitly provides for the types of cases that are covered by the Katarungang Pambarangay. However, since the aim of the law is to administer justice at the community level and make it as accessible as possible, the law recognizes the practice of resorting to local practices, customs, and traditions that have been in use in settling disputes brought before the Lupon.

The basic requirement under RA 7160 for the appointment as a member of the Lupon merely includes “those possessing integrity, impartiality, independence of mind, sense of fairness, and reputation for probity may be appointed as members of the Lupon”.³ Hence, to increase efficiency and effectiveness in implementing the mandates of the Katarungang Pambarangay Law, it is deemed desirable to establish a multisectoral advisory council who shall aid the implementers of the Katarungang Pambarangay Law pertaining to technical matters that are outside the expertise of the regular Lupon members who shall be coming from different sectors of the community such as women, indigenous people’s group, youths, religious group, persons with disabilities, tribal leader, community leader, among others.

In the Bangsamoro region, where the people have rich and diverse cultural backgrounds, the practice of settling local disputes may vary from one place to another. In most cases, the widely most commonly used method to settle disputes in the Barangay is the employment of the local customs and traditions. It will greatly benefit barangays throughout the region by establishing in each barangay a multisectoral advisory council that shall possess specialized skills and trainings on different aspects that pertain to their group. The multisectoral advisory council provides strategic guidance to help the Lupon make a well-informed decision on cases brought before them by the local disputing parties. While most lupons consist of a diverse group of highly skilled individuals, they may not always contain all the needed skill sets necessary to function effectively.

For these reasons, this representation earnestly asks for the approval of the bill.
