**REQUIRING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF BREASTFEEDING FACILITIES IN GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE ESTABLISHMENTS WITHIN THE BANGSAMORO REGION**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Breastfeeding has been shown not just to increase an infant's chances of survival, but it also protects them from common diseases. Breastfed children also perform better on intelligence tests and are less likely to be overweight later in life.

Many mothers return to work after giving birth, and being able to continue breastfeeding while at work can be challenging. Providing breastfeeding facilities in offices and establishments can help support working mothers to continue breastfeeding, and help improve employee morale and job satisfaction.

Given the benefits derived from breastfeeding, the measure seeks to mandate the regional government to promote its practice and create an enabling environment to encourage mothers to continue breastfeeding and help raise productive citizens. The measure may include the establishment of breastfeeding areas in all government and private offices and establishments within the BARMM, counseling, promotion of maternity protection, and monitoring of breastfeeding policies and practices.

In view of the foregoing, immediate passage of this bill is earnestly requested.
