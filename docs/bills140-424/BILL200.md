**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Sports play a significant role in promoting unity, fostering healthy competition, and inspiring a community's pride. Recognizing the importance of sports in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, this measure aims to honor and provide incentives to exceptional athletes who have achieved success in national and international competitions, thereby bringing pride and honor to the region. Furthermore, this bill seeks to establish a framework for the grant of incentives and resolutions of commendation to these outstanding athletes, fostering the development of sports within the BARMM.

The Bangsamoro Government recognizes the significance of sports in promoting social cohesion and enhancing the well-being of its constituents. It is essential to build upon this foundation by acknowledging the achievements of exceptional athletes and supporting their continued pursuit of excellence.

Recent years have witnessed remarkable accomplishments by athletes from the BARMM, who have excelled in various sports disciplines, representing the region both nationally and internationally. These athletes have brought pride and honor to the BARMM through their exceptional performances and have become role models for aspiring athletes within the region.

In line with the objectives of Republic Act No. 11054, this bill seeks to leverage the provisions of the Bangsamoro Organic Law to establish a framework for the recognition and provision of incentives to these outstanding athletes. By doing so, the bill aims to create an environment that encourages sports development, nurtures talent, and inspires future generations to excel in their chosen sports disciplines.

The grant of incentives is a crucial aspect of this bill, as it aims to provide tangible support and recognition to exceptional athletes. The measure provides various incentives for our athletes such as cash rewards, scholarships or educational grants, training programs and facilities, sports equipment and gear, access to sports science and sports medicine services, as well as support for participation in international competitions. The Bangsamoro Sports Commission, the governing body responsible for the promotion, development, and administration of sports activities within the BARMM, will play a central role in supervising and administering these incentives.

It is, therefore, our fervent hope that this bill will receive the support and approval of this esteemed legislative body, as we work towards honoring exceptional athletes, fostering sports development, and shaping a brighter future for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.
