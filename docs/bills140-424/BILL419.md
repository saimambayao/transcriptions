**AN ACT AMENDING BANGSAMORO AUTONOMY ACT NO. 35, ENTITLED “AN ACT PROVIDING FOR THE BANGSAMORO ELECTORAL CODE OF THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO”**

**Explanatory Note**

The journey toward a lasting and authentic autonomy for the Bangsamoro is etched in the promise of inclusion, fair representation, and a government that truly echoes the voices of its people. It is a promise we are duty-bound to keep. This bill represents a pivotal step in fulfilling that covenant by refining the Bangsamoro Electoral Code or the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 35 (BAA No. 35) to ensure our fledgling democracy is not only functional but also fundamentally just and resilient.

Our current electoral framework, while a foundational start, contains provisions that inadvertently silence certain voices and create unnecessary barriers to the vibrant political landscape we envision. A high electoral threshold, for instance, can stifle the very political diversity the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) seeks to nurture. It risks relegating smaller, community-rooted parties to the sidelines, denying them a seat at the table of governance. Learning from the wisdom of our nation’s highest court and best practices in proportional representation, we propose to lower this barrier. By doing so, we ensure that the composition of our Parliament genuinely reflects the rich tapestry of voter preferences, allowing a wider chorus of Bangsamoro narratives to contribute to our region’s destiny.

Furthermore, a true regional political party must be more than a name on a ballot; it must be an organic institution grown from the soil of our communities. This bill strengthens the roots of our parties by requiring a substantial and widespread membership base. This ensures that those seeking to represent the people are deeply connected to them, fostering a culture of accountability and grassroots engagement that is the lifeblood of a healthy democracy.

We also recognize that representation must be intentional. To build a Parliament that mirrors our society, we must consciously create space for those historically underrepresented. By mandating that a significant portion of party nominees are women, we actively weave the perspectives and leadership of Bangsamoro women into the very fabric of our law-making process. This is not a mere quota; it is a commitment to building a more balanced and inclusive future.

The process for seating our sectoral representatives—the voices of our youth, women, settlers’ community, NMIP, Traditional Leaders and Ulama—must be beyond reproach. This bill replaces ambiguity with crystalline procedures, ensuring the certification process is transparent, timely, and fair for all. Crucially, it mandates that the first election for these vital sectoral representatives shall be synchronized with the inaugural Parliamentary Election. This integration streamlines our democratic exercise, reduces administrative burden, and guarantees that these key sectors are represented from the very inception of our elected Parliament.

These amendments are the next logical and necessary steps in our collective journey. They are the safeguards we put in place today to protect the democracy we are building for tomorrow. By passing this bill, we move beyond aspiration and into action, crafting an electoral system that is not only sound in law but also true to the spirit of the Bangsamoro dream—a dream of a government truly of, by, and for our people.
