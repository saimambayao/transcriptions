**CREATING BANGSAMORO GRAND ATHLETIC AND SPORTS COMPLEXES IN COTABATO CITY AND LAMITAN CITY, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**Explanatory Note**

As the saying goes, "health is wealth." Living a healthy lifestyle is increasingly important. Overall personal well-being must be prioritized and can be strengthened through sports and physical activity, in addition to supporting mental and emotional well-being.

Section 13, Article II of the 1987 Constitution provides that, "The State recognizes the vital role of the youth in nation-building and shall promote and protect their physical, moral, spiritual, intellectual and social well-being."

Moreover, Section 19 (1), Article XIV of the same Constitution states that, "The State shall promote physical education and encourage sports programs, league competitions, and amateur sports, including training for international competitions, to foster self-discipline, teamwork, and excellence for the development of a healthy and alert citizenry."

This was reiterated in Section 13, Article IX of R.A. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) which provides that, "The Bangsamoro Government shall recognize the vital role of the youth in nation-building, promote and protect their physical, moral, spiritual, and nationalism, encourage involvement in public and civic affairs, and promote mental and physical fitness through sports." Section 20 of the same article provides that, "The Bangsamoro educational system shall recognize and supports programs, league competitions, indigenous games, martial arts, and amateur sports including training for regional, national, and international competitions."

According to World Health Organization (WHO), regular physical activity, including sports, cycling, wheeling, walking, active recreation and play, helps prevent and treat noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and breast and colon cancer. It also helps prevent hypertension, overweight and obesity and can improve mental health, quality of life and well-being¹.

On the international stage, more Filipino athletes are finding success. During the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2020, weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz won a gold medal in the women's 55 kg category. Similarly, Carlos Yulo, an artistic gymnast, achieved a historic double gold medal performance at the Paris 2024 Olympics—making him the first Filipino double Olympic gold medalist. These victories reflect a bright future for Philippine sports.

In the Bangsamoro region, many Bangsamoro youth are actively engaged in sports, and their participation can help them develop important physical and mental skills, including teamwork, discipline, and resilience.

Currently, there is no dedicated athletic and sports center in the Bangsamoro region.

A sports center holds great significance in shaping the Bangsamoro's future—a region historically affected by armed conflict and political instability. Through a sports center, the Bangsamoro youth will have a peaceful and constructive outlet that promotes unity and understanding from different cultural and religious backgrounds. Additionally, it can help build leadership and accountability. By fostering unity and hope, this sports center can play a crucial role in securing a better future for the Bangsamoro.

To pursue the aforementioned policies and laws, the establishment of Bangsamoro Grand Athletic and Sports Complexes in Cotabato City and Lamitan City is sought. These sports Complexes are strategic investments in peacebuilding that can result in regional transformation by nurturing the development and well-being of the Bangsamoro youth.

Furthermore, these Complexes would also give the Bangsamoro region a facility that can train and hone athletes who could compete in local and international tournaments, thereby bringing honor and glory to the Bangsamoro and the nation.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this measure is earnestly sought.
