**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Paragraph 2, Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054, also known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law, provides that the Bangsamoro Government shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. It shall also uphold the peoples' right to have access to essential goods, health, and other social services that promote their well-being.

In response to the growing demand for sustainable urban mobility and recognizing the benefits of promoting cycling as an eco-friendly mode of transportation, this bill proposes the establishment of a comprehensive bike route network that will interconnect various local government units (LGUs) within the Bangsamoro Region.

Cycling has gained significant traction as a viable means of transportation, offering numerous environmental, health, and economic benefits. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, alleviates traffic congestion, promotes physical activity, and enhances overall public health. However, the lack of safe designated path and a coherent and interconnected bike route network hinders its widespread adoption and safety.

The primary objective of this bill is to create a unified and comprehensive bike route network that links urban and rural areas across the Bangsamoro Region. By doing so, we aim to improve safety for cyclists by providing designated routes separate from motor vehicles. By providing safe and interconnected bike routes across local government units (LGUs), it can encourage more people to use bicycles as a mode of transportation for commuting and recreation.

Moreover, establishing a comprehensive bike route network can enhance connectivity between LGUs, promoting tourism, economic growth, and community cohesion. It shall also foster community engagement and public health through increased physical activity.

Hence, by integrating cycling into our transportation infrastructure, we can create greener, healthier, and more connected communities.

In consideration of the foregoing, and as the principal authors of this bill, we urge the Bangsamoro Parliament to give favorable consideration and support to this bill by enacting this legislation in order to contribute to the attainment of the Bangsamoro Government’s commitment to sustainable development, public health, and community well-being.
