Introduced by:
**HON. ATTY. RASOL Y. MITMUG, Jr.**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Whereas, Section 15, Article XII of Republic Act No. 11054 (Bangsamoro Organic Law) guarantees the Bangsamoro Government’s fiscal autonomy, including the right to receive an annual block grant and other development assistance from the national government;

Whereas, due to bureaucratic delays, procurement bottlenecks, and absorptive capacity limitations, significant portions of development allocations in BARMM remain unutilized by year-end, resulting in funds being reverted to the national treasury, undermining development continuity;

Whereas, to safeguard these funds and ensure project implementation continuity, it is imperative to create a dedicated Trust Fund that allows retention, carry-over, and multi-year programming of unspent yet committed development funds;

Now therefore, this Bill seeks to institutionalize the Bangsamoro Trust Fund for Development Continuity (BTFDC), define its legal structure and governance, and enable effective, accountable, and transparent use of development resources across fiscal years.

**HON. ATTY. RASOL Y. MITMUG, Jr.**

**AN ACT INSTITUTIONALIZING THE BANGSAMORO TRUST FUND FOR DEVELOPMENT CONTINUITY (BTFDC), PROVIDING FOR ITS STRUCTURE, MANAGEMENT, UTILIZATION, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

Be it enacted by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority in Parliament assembled:

**SECTION 1. Short Title.** This Act shall be known and cited as the “Bangsamoro Trust Fund for Development Continuity Act of 2025,” hereinafter referred to as the BTFDC Act.

**SECTION 2. Declaration of Policy.** It is hereby declared the policy of the Bangsamoro Government to uphold and advance the principles of fiscal autonomy, good governance, and development continuity by ensuring the efficient, accountable, and timely implementation of development programs and projects across the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

To this end, the Bangsamoro Government shall institutionalize a Bangsamoro Trust Fund for Development Continuity (BTFDC) as a fiscal mechanism that enables the retention, carryover, and programmed utilization of obligated but unutilized development funds. This shall apply to appropriations sourced from the Annual Block Grant, Special Development Fund, national government subsidies, official development assistance (ODA), and other lawful sources.

**SECTION 3. Creation of the Bangsamoro Trust Fund for Development Continuity (BTFDC).** There is hereby established the Bangsamoro Trust Fund for Development Continuity (BTFDC), a special fiduciary account under the stewardship of the Bangsamoro Government, designed to institutionalize the retention, programmed carryover, and strategic utilization of development funds that have been lawfully obligated but remain unutilized at the close of the fiscal year.

The BTFDC shall possess a distinct legal personality for fiduciary purposes, administered under the Ministry of Finance, Budget, and Management (MFBM), and shall operate under its direct administrative supervision, without prejudice to constitutional oversight mechanisms.

The BTFDC shall function as a mechanism for fiscal continuity and programmatic implementation, ensuring that budgetary allocations earmarked for development projects and public services are not forfeited due to technical, procurement, or administrative delays. Instead, such funds shall be retained, safeguarded, and deployed in accordance with approved work and financial plans, subject to appropriate audit and transparency safeguards.

**SECTION 4. Objectives.** The Bangsamoro Trust Fund for Development Continuity (BTFDC) is hereby established to pursue the following core objectives, consistent with the Bangsamoro Government’s mandate of fiscal autonomy, inclusive development, and responsive governance:

a. To prevent the automatic reversion of obligated but unutilized development funds to the National Treasury or other lapsing mechanisms, thereby safeguarding regional development allocations;
b. To enable the timely and full completion of development projects that encounter justifiable delays in procurement, implementation, or administrative processes, without forfeiting their corresponding budgets;
c. To institutionalize a legal and operational mechanism for the retention, carryover, and multi-year programming of development funds in accordance with approved work and financial plans and within legally defined retention periods;
d. To support strategic, long-term, and high-impact investments that align with the Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP), the Bangsamoro Regional Spatial Development Framework (RSDF), and other sectoral master plans;
e. To enhance the efficiency, transparency, and accountability of public financial management in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region through improved fund utilization, stronger internal controls, and citizen-participatory oversight mechanisms.

These objectives shall guide the governance, operationalization, and oversight of the BTFDC and shall be integrated into the policies, implementing rules, and monitoring frameworks governing the use of public resources in the region.

In case of competing fund utilization proposals, priority shall be given to programs addressing post-conflict rehabilitation, basic social services, and critical infrastructure, in alignment with the Bangsamoro Development Plan and subject to impact-based evaluation.

**SECTION 5. Fund Sources.** The Bangsamoro Trust Fund for Development Continuity (BTFDC) shall be composed of financial resources derived from the following lawful sources:

a. Unutilized balances of obligated funds from the Bangsamoro Government’s share in the Annual Block Grant, the Special Development Fund (SDF), and national government subsidies, which remain unspent at the end of the fiscal year, subject to validation and accounting reconciliation;
b. Grants, donations, contributions, and endowments from domestic and international institutions, including development partners, civil society organizations, philanthropic foundations, and bilateral or multilateral agencies, duly accepted by the Bangsamoro Government in accordance with existing rules;
c. Reflows, earnings, and interest income derived from fiduciary placements or trust fund investments, provided that such investments comply with Shari’ah principles and public financial management regulations;
d. Other legally authorized sources expressly appropriated or reallocated for development purposes through acts of the Bangsamoro Parliament or with concurrence of national oversight bodies, subject to audit and compliance requirements under COA and DBM guidelines.

All fund sources shall be recorded, reported, and audited in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Bangsamoro Organic Law, the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), applicable Commission on Audit (COA) regulations, and the Implementing Rules and Regulations of this Act.


**SECTION 6. Eligible Uses.** The Bangsamoro Trust Fund for Development Continuity (BTFDC) shall be utilized exclusively to support development undertakings that are consistent with the principles of good governance, inclusive growth, and strategic resilience. The following shall constitute eligible uses of the Fund:

a. The continuing implementation, completion, or recommencement of delayed, ongoing, or partially implemented development projects, including those hindered by procurement, logistical, or administrative constraints;
b. The funding of priority programs and projects in key sectors such as infrastructure, public health, education, sustainable livelihood, digital transformation, energy access, research, and innovation, as identified in the Bangsamoro Development Plan and sectoral master plans;
c. The establishment of contingency reserves, adaptive measures, and risk mitigation mechanisms to support critical or high-value development initiatives affected by natural disasters, conflict, fiscal shocks, or force majeure events;
d. The implementation of capacity-building programs, community-driven development projects, and peacebuilding initiatives, including those aligned with the principles of transitional justice and reconciliation, particularly in conflict-affected, marginalized, and underserved areas.

All fund disbursements shall be governed by approved work and financial plans, subject to performance-based monitoring, and aligned with the public investment priorities of the Bangsamoro Government. Utilization shall be in accordance with relevant financial accountability standards, Shari’ah-compliant fiduciary rules, and oversight mechanisms established by law.

The BTFDC shall not be used for personal services expenditures, debt servicing, political activities, or any other purpose not directly related to project implementation and development outcomes as certified by the BTFDC Management Board.

**SECTION 7. Fund Retention and Carryover.** The Bangsamoro Trust Fund for Development Continuity (BTFDC) is hereby authorized to retain and carry over unutilized but obligated development funds beyond the close of the fiscal year, for a maximum period of two (2) succeeding fiscal years, in accordance with the principles of accountability, efficiency, and programmatic implementation.

Such retention and carryover shall be subject to the execution of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the Bangsamoro Government, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), the Commission on Audit (COA), and the Intergovernmental Fiscal Policy Board (IFPB), which shall set forth the specific terms, conditions, reporting standards, and fiduciary controls governing the use and monitoring of retained funds.

a. Supported by a justifiable cause, such as force majeure, conflict, or inter-agency delay;
b. Certified by the appropriate implementing ministry or agency;
c. Compliant with applicable auditing and fiscal management standards.
