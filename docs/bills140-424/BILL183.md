**AN ACT ENABLING THE ACCELERATION OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is a region with vast potential for growth and development. In order to realize this potential, it is necessary to expedite the approval and implementation of infrastructure programs and projects in the region. Unfortunately, the regulatory and approval processes for infrastructure projects in the region have been plagued by inefficiencies, and bureaucratic red tape which have resulted in delays, cost overruns, and suboptimal outcomes.

To address this problem, this measure seeks to establish an Infrastructure Acceleration Office (IAO) in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. The IAO will be the main regional agency responsible for streamlining and simplifying the regulatory and approval processes for infrastructure programs and projects in the region. The IAO will work closely with relevant government agencies to ensure that infrastructure projects are properly planned, implemented, and monitored.

The establishment of the IAO will have significant benefits for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. First, it will help to promote transparency, accountability, and efficiency in the regulatory and approval processes for infrastructure projects. This will help to reduce delays and corruption in the process, which will, in turn, improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of infrastructure programs and projects in the region. Second, it will facilitate the timely completion of infrastructure projects, which will enhance the region's competitiveness, attract investments, and generate employment opportunities. Finally, it will provide an effective mechanism for monitoring and evaluating infrastructure programs and projects, which will help to ensure that they are contributing to the region's sustainable development.

In summary, the establishment of the Infrastructure Acceleration Office in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is a vital measure that will facilitate the development of the region's infrastructure programs and projects, reduce bureaucratic red tape and corruption, and promote transparency, accountability, and efficiency in the regulatory and approval processes. It is hoped that this measure will help to unlock the vast potential for growth and development in the region and promote the well-being of the Bangsamoro people.

In view of the foregoing, approval of this bill is earnestly sought.
