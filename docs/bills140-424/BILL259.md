**AN ACT**
**ESTABLISHING THE BANGSAMORO LEARNING RECOVERY FUND, THEREBY IMPLEMENTING COMPREHENSIVE LEARNING RECOVERY INITIATIVES FOR STUDENTS IN RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges to the education system in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, with far-reaching consequences for the learning outcomes and academic progress of the students. The sudden closure of schools, the shift to remote learning, and the disruption of traditional educational routines have created substantial learning gaps, exacerbating existing disparities in our educational landscape.

This measure is a legislative response to this critical need. It establishes a dedicated Learning Recovery Fund to channel resources specifically toward bridging the learning gaps that have emerged during the pandemic.

The primary objective of this legislation is to empower the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education (MBHTE) to deploy the Learning Recovery Fund for a range of targeted initiatives. These initiatives include additional tutoring and academic support for students who have fallen behind, the expansion of accessible and high-quality educational resources, specific interventions for students with special education needs or disabilities, opportunities for professional development among educators to enhance their capacity to address these learning gaps, and the promotion of community engagement and parental involvement in education.

It is important to emphasize that this legislation prioritizes those who have been most affected by the learning gaps and seeks to address the unique challenges faced by disadvantaged and vulnerable students. The Act is designed to be in effect until a specified date, after which it will undergo a thorough review and renewal process, ensuring its relevance and effectiveness in an ever-evolving educational landscape.

This Act underscores our dedication to a robust and equitable education system and represents our commitment to the future of our students and the long-term prosperity of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
