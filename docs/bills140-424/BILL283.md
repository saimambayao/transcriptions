**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

This bill primarily aims to improve access to medical services and modern health facilities for the people of Tipo-tipo Municipality, the Province of Basilan, and its neighboring municipalities within the BARMM territory.

The Municipality of Tipo-tipo with its increasing population and economic boost, requires immediate conductive medical facilities and hospital services to address more health needs of its people, especially those with grave illnesses that require immediate attention and hospitalization.

The Municipality of Tipo Tipo is a third-class municipality, with 11 barangays and a total population of 25,531 people across 4,195 households according to the 2020 PSA Census.

The nearest existing hospital from the Municipality of Tipo-tipo is Lamitan District Hospital 22.2 kilometers away via Basilan Circumferential Road. Patients are forced to travel long hours to reach the nearest hospital However, in extreme cases, patients who need advanced medical treatment are transferred immediately to Provincial Hospital Zamboanga City which compels them to travel by sea.

Given the circumstances, the establishment of an infirmary hospital for the constituents of the Municipality of Tipo-tipo is highly sought. This creation shall be in support of the Enhanced 12-Point Priority Agenda of the Bangsamoro Government to create an environment where everyone has access to healthcare services, facilities, and resources to improve health.
