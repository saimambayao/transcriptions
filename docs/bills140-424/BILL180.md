**AN ACT
ADOPTING AN INTEGRATED COASTAL MANAGEMENT POLICY IN THE BANGSAMORO REGION, ESTABLISHING MECHANISMS AND PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is home to diverse coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, seagrass beds, and coral reefs, which provide essential ecological, economic, and cultural benefits to the local communities. The coastal environments in BARMM play a crucial role in providing livelihood opportunities to the people. Fisheries and aquaculture are the primary sources of income for many communities, and these rely heavily on the health and productivity of the coastal ecosystems. Coastal areas also serve as critical transportation hubs, connecting communities to other parts of the region and the country.

However, these coastal environments face numerous threats, including overfishing, pollution, and habitat destruction. Climate change also poses a significant risk, with rising sea levels and increasing ocean temperatures affecting the health of these ecosystems. Additionally, conflicts in the region, particularly in coastal areas, can exacerbate these challenges, leading to further degradation of the environment.

To ensure the continued health and productivity of the coastal environments in BARMM, it is crucial to implement measures to protect them. This includes regulating fishing practices, reducing pollution, and conserving habitat areas through the establishment of marine protected areas. Additionally, education and awareness-raising campaigns can help to promote sustainable practices and encourage communities to take an active role in protecting their local ecosystems. By implementing measures to safeguard these valuable ecosystems, we can ensure that they continue to provide benefits to current and future generations.

In view of the foregoing, approval of this bill is earnestly sought.
