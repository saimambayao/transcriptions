**AN ACT**
**ESTABLISHING THE BANGSAMORO TEACHERS’ CONTINUING EDUCATION PROGRAM, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Education is a powerful tool that can transform societies, uplift individuals, and foster economic growth. In the context of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), education holds even greater importance due to its potential to bring peace, unity, and prosperity to the region. One crucial aspect of enhancing the quality of education in Bangsamoro is the establishment of a continuing education program for teachers.

Continuous education allows Bangsamoro teachers to keep pace with the evolving field of education. Teachers can learn about innovative teaching methods, technologies, and educational tools that can enhance their classroom practices. This, in turn, leads to improved learning outcomes for students.

The establishment of a continuing education program sends a clear message that the government and society value the work of teachers. This recognition can motivate teachers to perform at their best and be more committed to their profession. It not only improves the quality of education but also enhances teacher motivation, addresses unique regional needs, and contributes to the long-term development of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. By investing in its educators, the region invests in its future, paving the way for a more educated, prosperous, and peaceful society.

Due to the foregoing, immediate passage of this bill is earnestly requested.
