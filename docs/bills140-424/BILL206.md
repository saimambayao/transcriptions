**AN ACT PROVIDING FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF LOCAL ROADS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Roads play a significant role as part of essential and basic social infrastructure for livelihood and economic activity. Indubitably, roads facilitate better travel experiences for people, making their daily life activities even more active and competitive, which may open more opportunities for trade and commerce, tourism and make travel easy for people going to work or school and other personal transactions.

According to the 2nd Bangsamoro Development Plan 2023-2028, BARMM accounts for only 3% of the national roads of the country. As of 2021, out of the entire national road network of 1,038 kilometers in BARMM, only 10.09 kilometers are left unpaved. However, about 24% of the region’s national roads are in poor condition.

Meanwhile, the consolidated length of the local road network in BARMM is 10,912.58 kilometers, consisting of provincial, municipal, and barangay roads. This data was collected from all LGUs of BARMM municipalities and provinces, including the recently added Special Geographic Area. More than 40% of BARMM’s local roads are unpaved. The pavement rates of Local roads by province are as follows: Maguindanao, 39.36%; Lanao Del Sur, 48.58; Basilan, 68.15; Sulu, 64.47; Tawi-Tawi, 47.03; Special Geographic Area, 26.19.

Under the present institutional setup, local roads are maintained by the local government. Pursuant to the Local Government Code of 1991, province-funded roads are maintained by the local Provincial Engineer’s Office (PEO), city/municipal roads are maintained by the respective Engineering services, and the Barangay Roads by the local Barangay council through the Barangay Roads maintenance committee. However, the Ministry of Public Works shall have a concurrent role with the LGUs pertaining to road maintenance.

The lack of proper maintenance of local roads within the BARMM region is apparent, as shown by potholes, cracked pavements, collapsing shoulders, and faded road markings, among others.

Local governments, by law – particularly through the Local Government Code, are expected to address the deterioration of public assets, like roads, within their respective jurisdictions. Due to the nature of the country’s budgeting system and the dynamics of local decision-making processes, needed action to stall the deterioration of infrastructure usually comes late or not at all. As a result, this often leads to more expensive rehabilitation or reconstruction. Moreover, under current government procurement laws and practices, construction of infrastructure projects entails bidding that is most often participated in by contractors from outside the community. In reality, routine maintenance does not require big contractors. For all types of roads, the budget for operations and maintenance comes from three primary sources: the General Fund (General Appropriations Act); 20 percent of the Internal Revenue Allotments to Local Governments, or the Development Fund; and the Special Local Roads Fund (SLRF), as provided for under Republic Act (RA) 8794 or the Motor Vehicles Users’ Charge (MVUC) Law.

Despite the existing provisions under the Local Government Code of 1991 mandating the LGUs to undertake maintenance of their respective local roads, in the enactment of the annual budget, the amount to be allocated for road maintenance shall be subject to the discretion of the LGUs, which may not even provide the substantial difference for the purpose if not listed as its top priorities. With the meager amount given by the LGUs for road maintenance, it may not attain the purpose of ensuring that roads under their responsibility and jurisdiction are properly maintained. It is, therefore, not unusual for road users to see a lack of maintenance of the local roads in the whole of the Bangsamoro Region. The absence of a sense of urgency for the LGUs pertaining to their roles in maintaining local roads will have a direct adverse impact on their respective communities' economic and other activities.

Nowadays, roads are an essential part of how society functions. As people are heavily in need of road usage for trade and commerce, employment, education, and other emergencies, a lack of road maintenance will decrease transport accessibility, service delivery quality, and road users' safety. Therefore, it is believed that to mandate the constituent local government units to apportion from their annual budget appropriation for the maintenance of local roads would essentially advance the general collective interests of their constituencies.

Hence, this representation earnestly sought the passage of this bill.
