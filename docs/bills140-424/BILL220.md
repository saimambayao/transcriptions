**AN ACT PROVIDING FOR THE DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSIVITY IN PUBLIC SERVICE ACT OF 2023**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) mandates the Bangsamoro Government to promote unity, peace, justice, and goodwill among all people. It also obliges the Bangsamoro Government to ensure that every Filipino within its jurisdiction is afforded equal opportunities and promotes social justice in all aspects of life and phases of development in the region. It is further required to recognize and promote the rights of non-Moro indigenous peoples.

Finally, the BOL also prescribed that the Bangsamoro Government shall protect all persons from harassment or any undue pressure, coercion, and violence due to religion.

These are all aligned to the principle of moral governance that the present government advocates, which is an adaptation of what Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said in his Last Message when he in part said:

“All mankind is from Adam and Eve. An Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab, nor does a non-Arab have any superiority over an Arab; a white has no superiority over a black, nor does a black have any superiority over a white; [none have superiority over another] except by piety and good action. Learn that every Muslim is a brother to every Muslim and constitutes one brotherhood. Nothing shall be legitimate to a Muslim that belongs to a fellow Muslim unless given freely and willingly. Do not, and therefore, do injustice to yourselves.”

The Bangsamoro knows best how discrimination based on belief and cultural differences can affect peaceful co-existence. Our decades of bloody struggle were precisely a demand for equal treatment and equal rights.

Our region comprises diverse tribes, religious beliefs, and cultural differences. Indeed, there is beauty amidst diversity. Consequently, new legislation measures are timely to counter absenteeism, low performance, and resentment from the locals.

This government promised Moral Governance, and with Moral Governance, we shall stand. The passage of this proposed bill is earnestly sought.
