**INSTITUTING THE SCHEDULE OF SUBMISSION OF THE PROPOSED BANGSAMORO BUDGET EXPENDITURE PROGRAM, INCREASING BUDGET TRANSPARENCY AND PARTICIPATION, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The proposed legislative measure aims to establish a schedule for the submission of the proposed expenditure program for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), not later than thirty (30) days from the fourth Monday of July of every year. The submission of the proposed expenditure program is crucial for the effective governance and fiscal planning of the region. By implementing a standardized schedule, this measure seeks to enhance transparency, accountability, and efficiency in the budgetary processes of the BARMM.

Since its inception, the BARMM has faced challenges in the timely submission of its proposed expenditure program. The absence of a specific schedule has led to inconsistencies in the budgetary process, hindering effective governance. To address these issues, this legislative measure seeks to establish a specific schedule for the submission of the proposed expenditure program.

The legislative measure aims to achieve the following objectives:

A. Standardize the schedule: The proposed legislation sets a fixed and consistent timetable for the submission of the proposed expenditure program, ensuring that it is prepared and submitted in a timely manner.

B. Enhance transparency and accountability: By instituting a schedule, the measure promotes transparency in the budgetary process, allowing stakeholders, including the public, to have sufficient time to review and provide feedback on the proposed expenditure program.

C. Improve efficiency and planning: The establishment of a schedule enables the Bangsamoro Government to streamline its budgetary processes. This allows for better coordination with the national government and facilitates effective planning, resulting in the efficient allocation of resources and improved service delivery to the constituents of the BARMM.

Thus, by establishing a structured schedule, this measure aims to enhance transparency, accountability, and efficiency in the budgetary processes of the BARMM. It promotes effective governance, improves service delivery, and ultimately contributes to the overall development and well-being of the people in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
