**BILL**

**AN ACT ADOPTING A RESETTLEMENT AND REHABILITATION FRAMEWORK ACTION PLAN FOR INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS AND CONFLICT-AFFECTED COMMUNITIES, CREATING FOR THE PURPOSE, A RESETTLEMENT AND REHABILITATION DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL, PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSE**

*Be it enacted by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament in a session assembled.*

**Section 1. Short Title-** This Act shall be known as **Bangsamoro Resettlement and Rehabilitation Act of 2022.**

**Section 2. Background-** since 1969, there has been active conflict in Mindanao. This has led to widespread displacement, as well as infrastructure and shelters damage. As of the 30th of June 2019, a total number of 75, 567 families or 351,647 individuals were displaced in Mindanao. In the first half of 2020, there were Sixty Six thousand (66,000) more new displacements because of intermittent conflict. The siege of Marawi in 2017, destroyed much of the city and displaced four hundred thousand (400,000) people. Today, approximately 126,000 residents from Marawi are still in temporary shelters, or living with relatives. The Philippine Foreign Affairs Department also reported that around 400,000 undocumented overseas Filipinos workers in the western state of Sabah, Malaysia are at risk of massive crackdown since August of 2016. Most of the undocumented Filipinos hail from Basilan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi. Also, About Sixty Thousand (60,000) to Eighty thousand (80,000) more OFW are estimated to be repatriated due to global COVID 19 pandemic according to reports from various Philippine Overseas Labor Offices of DOLE, portion of them are BARMM constituencies. Through all the foregoing accounts, the scale of internal displacement is clearly not only a derivative of armed conflict as were conjured in past reports. It is rather a complex phenomenon with diverse implications for individuals and societies that it affects and has consequences that are immediate;

**Section 3. Declaration of Principle.** Section 8, Article IX, entitled Social Justice enshrined under RA 11054 otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law declares, “that the Bangsamoro Government shall provide, among others, appropriate services, livelihood opportunities, affordable and progressive housing projects. It shall also ensure the rehabilitation of calamity-affected areas and victims of such calamities. In same Article IX, section 9, it states that, “Parliament shall pass a law creating a housing and human settlements agency to address the lack of shelters, settlements and livelihood for the disadvantaged and homeless especially those victims of conflicts and atrocities.”

General lack of political solution to resolve the drivers of displacement associated with the continuing conflict in the region, economic fallout engendered by Pandemic 19, and currently by the global energy crisis, internal displacement has become protracted that requires concerted effort. Consequently, our government has the primary responsibility to ensure that IDPs’ basic rights to food, water, shelter, dignity and safety are met in addition to facilitating their access to all other rights.

**Section 4. Definition of Terms-** As used in this Act, the following term shall apply:
