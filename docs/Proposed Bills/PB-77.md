**AN ACT**
**STRENGTHENING THE BANGSAMORO SATELLITE COORDINATING OFFICES, DEFINING ITS COVERAGE, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Geographically, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region encompasses the provinces of Basilan (except Isabela City), Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi, as well as Marawi City, Lamitan City, Cotabato City, and the sixty-three barangays in Cotabato. The coordination between these areas as well as the different levels of government in the region is essential to ensuring the protection and promotion of the general welfare of the Bangsamoro people.

Close cooperation and continuous dialogue between these regional actors, will enable the Bangsamoro Government make informed policy decisions and crucial changes in its implementation, if needed, and ultimately lead to responsiveness and efficiency.

Overlapping government mandates and unclear distinctions in agency responsibilities will make policy formulation and implementation difficult and may create gaps in oversight and enforcement. In addition, competing areas of jurisdiction in various aspects of regional and local governance can produce operational inefficiencies.

In the absence of a strong coordinating mechanism between the programs and policies initiated by the regional government and those of its LGUs may lead to operational gaps. Changes in political leadership exacerbate the issue by disrupting the ability of policymakers to build on previous successes, and retain the lessons learned from their predecessors. Without an effective mechanism for coordination between the region and its component LGUs, the overlapping mandates and competing priorities of regional and local government units will hinder the achievement of shared long-term goals.

This measure aims to strengthen the partnership, coordination, management, and communication of government programs formulated and imitated by the regional government and those of its component LGUs. A more targeted approach such as the one introduced in this measure can increase the efficiency of the government in how resources are being used by regional and local government agencies.

The synergy of measures in tackling various regional and local issues in the autonomous region will assist the government to directly address various issues and concerns across all-encompassing jurisdictions within the region. Thus, strengthening the Bangsamoro Satellite Coordinating Office of the various sub-regions in BARMM can increase operational effectiveness and reinforce the efficient implementation of the programs of the government.

Encouraging consistent dialogue between the Bangsamoro Government and its component local government units will ensure that the region can maintain its autonomous status while still synchronizing its sustainability efforts compared to other neighboring regions. The efforts to strengthen the Bangsamoro Satellite Coordinating Offices in each of the BARMM sub-regions can facilitate the much-needed cooperation between the Bangsamoro Government and its component LGUs if given enough resources and prioritization.

Working together throughout the levels of government and across sectors will lend itself to efficient resource use and optimizes response capabilities. If enacted, this will strengthen one of the most effective mechanisms available to the region to synergize regional government operations with local government policies and plans, bringing about the creation of a more robust and efficient government.

By adopting this proactive and unified approach, the Bangsamoro Government can contribute significantly to the future stability of the region.

In view of the foregoing, approval of this bill is earnestly sought.
