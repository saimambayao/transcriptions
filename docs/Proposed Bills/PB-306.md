**AN ACT PROVIDING FOR FIVE (5) - DAY SPECIAL EMERGENCY LEAVE FOR ALL WORKERS IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS IN BARMM DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY NATURAL CALAMITIES OR DISASTERS**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Natural calamities and disasters are a recurrent challenge for the Philippines, a nation situated within the "Pacific Ring of Fire" and along the Pacific typhoon belt. These catastrophic events, ranging from typhoons and earthquakes to floods, volcanic eruptions, landslides, and fires, pose significant risks to communities across the archipelago. Despite concerted efforts to enhance disaster preparedness and resilience, many Filipinos continue to grapple with the adverse impacts of these hazards, particularly those residing in high-risk areas.

In the year 2021 alone, the Philippines endured a staggering 80 disastrous events linked to natural causes, affecting over 20.5 million people and resulting in economic losses amounting to approximately Php60.6 billion. Notably, Typhoon Odette (I.N. Rai), which struck in December of 2021, ranked fourth globally in terms of both fatalities and the number of people affected. These alarming statistics highlight the urgency of implementing targeted measures to support individuals directly impacted by such calamities.

The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) shares in these challenges, facing similar risks and vulnerabilities. In 2022, widespread flooding prompted a state of calamity, displacing thousands of families and causing extensive damage to crops and properties. Moreover, the region contends with the added burden of armed conflicts, contributing to further displacement and exacerbating the plight of affected communities.

In light of these circumstances, this proposed legislation seeks to address the specific needs of workers in BARMM directly affected by natural calamities or disasters.

By providing a five (5) - day special emergency leave, we aim to recognize the profound distress experienced by affected employees and prioritize their well-being during crisis situations.

Key provisions of the bill include eligibility criteria defining qualified employees directly impacted by natural calamities or disasters in BARMM, encompassing individuals whose homes are damaged, those compelled to evacuate, or those encountering other adverse effects due to the disaster. Eligible employees shall be entitled to a five (5) - day special emergency leave each year, distinct from regular vacation or sick leave entitlements. Importantly, during this special emergency leave, employees are entitled to their regular compensation and benefits without fear of deductions or penalties imposed by their employers.

The enactment of this legislation reflects our commitment to supporting BARMM workers during times of crisis. By providing a safety net through special emergency leave, we reaffirm our dedication to upholding the rights and welfare of our constituents, particularly in moments of adversity.

Let us stand united in ensuring that every Bangsamoro people is afforded the necessary support and protection amidst the challenges posed by natural calamities, armed conflicts, and other health crises.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.

**Section 1. Short Title.** This Act shall be known as the "Bangsamoro Special Emergency Leave Act of 2024."

**Section 2. Declaration of Policy.** The Bangsamoro Government places significant emphasis on protecting the rights of our workers and promoting their welfare, as provided in Article I, Sec. 18 of the Constitution. In compliance therewith, it is of utmost importance that workers and their right to safe and healthful working conditions must always be upheld.

Towards this end, and consistent with legal instruments that protect and promote the rights of the workers, the Bangsamoro Government shall institutionalize a mechanism to grant special emergency leave to an employee affected by natural calamities/disasters. Labor, as a primary social economic force, shall be given the protection that the exigencies of time and circumstances mandate.

**Section 3. Applicability.** All rights and benefits granted to employees under this Act apply to all officials, workers, and employees, whether in the public or private sector within the BARMM.

This Act shall not apply to government workers or employees who render services during or on the occasion of natural calamities or disasters.

**Section 4. Definition of Terms.** For the purposes of this Act, the following terms shall be defined as:

a) Natural Calamities: Any catastrophic events arising from natural phenomena, including but not limited to typhoons, earthquakes, floods, volcanic eruptions, landslides, and fires.
b) Disaster: Encompasses both natural calamities and man-made events resulting in significant disruptions, damages, or loss of life, property, or livelihood, exceeding the capability of the affected community to cope using its own resources.

**Section 5. Special Emergency Leave.**

a. Every employee who has rendered at least one (1) year of service shall be entitled to five (5)-days of special emergency leave each year, with pay, in times of natural calamities or disasters, based on any of the grounds specified in Section 8 of this Act.

b. This provision shall not be applicable to individuals already availing themselves of the entitlements herein, irrespective of designation, including those benefiting from emergency leave provisions lasting a minimum of five days during periods of natural calamities, disasters, or personal emergencies. Additionally, this provision shall not extend to employees within entities consistently employing fewer than ten (10) individuals, or entities exempted from offering this benefit by the Minister of Labor and Employment, contingent upon an assessment of the operational feasibility of such entities.

**Section 6. Notification.** Qualified employees must notify their employers about their need for special emergency leave as soon as possible, but no later than 24 hours after the occurrence of the calamity. This notification should be provided through the most expedient means available, such as but not limited to, email, phone call, or in-person communication.

**Section 7. Grant of Special Emergency Leave.** The entitlement to the five (5)-day Special Emergency Leave with pay is subject to the declaration of a state of calamity by either the President of the Philippines or the Local Sanggunian, in accordance with Section 16 of R.A No. 10121. Nonetheless, acknowledging circumstances where a specific area may not receive formal declaration under a state of calamity yet still faces severe consequences from a natural calamity or disaster, the head of the office or employer, exercising sound discretion, retains the authority to grant the special emergency leave to an affected qualified employee. Such discretion shall be exercised based on presented proof or evidence, or verified news accounts.

This special emergency leave can be utilized either consecutively for five (5) working days or staggered and will not be deducted from the employee's leave credits.

Employees are eligible to avail themselves of this leave within ten (10) days from the date when the natural calamity or disaster occurred, but no later than 6 months after the calamitous event. Failure to claim the leave within this specified period shall result in forfeiture of the entitlement.

**Section 8. Grounds for Special Emergency Leave.** Eligible employees may avail themselves of calamity leave under any of the following circumstances:

a) Being stranded in affected areas where safe transportation to and from work is not feasible;
b) Contracting a disease or illness directly resulting from a natural calamity or disaster;
c) Providing care and assistance to immediate family members impacted by the natural calamity or disaster; or
d) Engaging in urgent repair and clean-up efforts pertaining to their damaged residence.

**Section 9. Verification.** The responsibility for granting special emergency leave in accordance with this Act rests with the head of the office, contingent upon verifying the eligibility of the employee. In evaluating an employee's eligibility for the leave provided herein, the head of the office or employer shall consider the following criteria:

1) Place of Residence: Verification of the employee's residence using the most recent available records, ensuring alignment with areas identified as affected by competent government authorities;
2) Declaration of Calamity: Confirmation of the calamitous status by the appropriate government agency, including official declarations or bulletins;
3) Medical Certification: Submission of a duly authenticated medical certificate affirming that the illness or injury was directly incurred by the employee or their immediate family member as a direct consequence of the natural calamity or disaster, with specific reference to the medical condition and its causal relationship to the calamitous event;
4) Accessibility and Availability of Public Transportation: Evaluation of the accessibility and adequacy of public transportation services on the day of the natural calamity or disaster, considering factors such as road closures, transportation disruptions, and logistical constraints that may hinder safe travel to and from the workplace;
5) Extent of Damage and Disruption: Assessment of the extent of damage and disruption caused by the calamitous event, including its impact on infrastructure, utilities, and essential services, as well as the severity of displacement and distress experienced by the affected employee and their immediate family members;
6) Any other relevant factors that may assist the head of the office in determining the eligibility of the employee to avail of the said grant.

**Section 10. Suspension or Cancellation of Work.** In the event of the head of office or employer declaring the suspension or cancellation of work due to a natural calamity or disaster, employees shall not be required to apply for special emergency leave during such periods of suspension or cancellation.

**Section 11. Non-cumulative and On-commutative.** Leaves accrued under the provisions of this Act shall not be cumulative and are non-convertible into monetary compensation. Unused leaves shall not carry over from one period to another and must be utilized within the prescribed timeframe, as stipulated in Section 7.

**Section 12. Non-diminution of Benefit.** Benefits granted under this Act shall not, in any manner, mean any reduction, diminution, discontinuation, or elimination of other existing benefits already enjoyed by workers. Rights already vested before the effectivity of this Act shall remain to be in full force and effect upon the passage of this Act.

**Section 13. Construction in favor of labor.** All doubts in the interpretation and implementation of the provision of this Act shall be resolved in favor of labor.

**Section 14. Implementing Rules and Regulations.** The Ministry of Labor and Employment and other government agencies charged with the administration and enforcement of this Act shall promulgate the necessary implementing rules and regulations.

**Section 15. Separability Clause.** In the event that any provision of this Act is declared to be unconstitutional or invalid, other provisions thereof that are not affected thereby shall continue to be in force and effect.

**Section 16. Repealing Clause.** All other orders and related issuances inconsistent with the provisions of this Act are hereby repealed.

**Section 17. Effectivity.** This Act shall take effect fifteen (15) days after its publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.
