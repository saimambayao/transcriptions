**AN ACT**
**ESTABLISHING THE BANGSAMORO WOMEN’S WELFARE CENTER ( مركز رعاية المرأة في بنغسامورو ) IN EVERY PROVINCE AND MAJOR HOSPITAL IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO (BARMM) TO PROVIDE CULTURALLY INCLUSIVE AND GENDER-SENSITIVE HEALTH SERVICES FOR WOMEN, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Maternal and women’s health care remains a significant challenge worldwide, with many regions facing disparities in access to quality services. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), maternal mortality rates globally remain alarmingly high, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. In 2023, approximately 287,000 women died due to complications from pregnancy and childbirth, with a disproportionate number occurring in countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and South Asia (WHO, 2025)¹. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA, 2023)² stresses that improving maternal health is essential for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being), which aims to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030.

In the Philippine context, maternal health remains a major concern. Despite improvements, the Philippine Statistics Authority (2021)³ reports that 24.5 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births still occur, which is higher than the global target of less than 20 deaths. A study by Dela Cruz et al. (2022)⁴ revealed that rural and conflict-affected areas, such as those in Mindanao, face heightened challenges in providing access to health care, with insufficient prenatal and postnatal services and a lack of specialized maternal health institutions. This is exacerbated by displacement, poor infrastructure, and cultural barriers, particularly in remote areas like the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), where the maternal mortality rate is above the national average (Philippine Department of Health, 2022).

Locally, in BARMM, women face acute barriers to accessing comprehensive health care. The Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority (BPDA, 2023)⁵ identifies that no hospital in the region currently has a dedicated, specialized institution for women’s health that offers prenatal, postnatal, reproductive health, and psychological services. Women in BARMM often rely on traditional healthcare practices, which are not always equipped to handle modern medical complications, resulting in high maternal mortality rates and poor health outcomes for both mothers and infants. According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) (2020)⁶, women in BARMM suffer from a lack of access to healthcare infrastructure, and many face challenges such as poverty, lack of education, social stigma, and violence, which prevent them from seeking the necessary medical support during pregnancy and childbirth.

Further, Bangsamoro women who undergo reproductive health services are often subjected to traditional practices that may not align with modern medical standards or Islamic teachings on women’s health, which promote the holistic care of both physical and mental well-being. The Qur’an offers strong guidance on the importance of maternal care, stating, “We have enjoined upon man [care] for his parents. His mother carried him with hardship upon hardship, and his weaning is in two years. Be grateful to Me and to your parents; to Me is the [final] destination.” (Qur’an 31:14).

This guidance provides an essential foundation for promoting maternal care that honors both Islamic values and modern medical standards.

In light of these challenges, the Bangsamoro Women’s Welfare Center ( مركز رعاية المرأة في بنغسامورو ) is proposed to address these significant gaps. This institution will be a comprehensive, culturally-sensitive, and faith-aligned health center that focuses on maternal and women’s health in BARMM. It will provide specialized services for prenatal, postnatal, reproductive health, and mental health support, grounded in Islamic principles and modern healthcare practices. The establishment of this center will not only address health care access issues but will also honor the dignity of women and promote community-based support systems in line with both Islamic teachings and international standards for gender-responsive health care.

This initiative is aligned with international frameworks such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 3, which advocates for the reduction of maternal mortality and the promotion of well-being for women and children. It also supports the Philippine Development Plan 2022-2028, which emphasizes improving the health and welfare of women, particularly in underserved and marginalized communities. By establishing the Bangsamoro Women’s Welfare Center ( مركز رعاية المرأة في بنغسامورو ), the region will not only address health care deficits but also contribute to the empowerment of women, providing them with the opportunity to participate actively in the social and economic development of the Bangsamoro region.

The Bangsamoro Women’s Welfare Center ( مركز رعاية المرأة في بنغسامورو ) will serve as a holistic health institution, focusing on women’s physical, mental, and emotional well-being, while incorporating Islamic values of care, dignity, and support. It will work to reduce maternal and infant mortality rates, enhance mental health support for women, and provide a culturally appropriate, faith-centered approach to reproductive health and family planning. Through this initiative, the Bangsamoro region can lead by example in integrating gender-responsive, culturally sensitive, and Islamically informed health care models to ensure better health outcomes for all women.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
