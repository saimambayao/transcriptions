For this purpose, the Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education (MBHTE) will impose mechanisms that will improve the quality of Madrasah education as well as open the opportunity of more Muslim students benefiting said educational system through maximizing the use of existing resources of public education, recognizing in the process the government responsibility to provide equal education to its people.
