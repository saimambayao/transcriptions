A clear precedent for this measure exists. During the dissolution of the ARMM in 2019, the **National Government**, in partnership with the **Bangsamoro Transition Authority** and the **Department of Budget and Management (DBM)**, allocated an initial ₱500 million to provide gratuity and **separation benefits** to thousands of ARMM employees affected by the transition. The computation of benefits followed Section 10, Article XVI of the BOL, granting one hundred percent (100%) of the monthly basic salary for every year of service to those with at least one year but less than five; one hundred fifty percent (150%) for those with five but less than ten; and two hundred percent (200%) for those with ten years or more of service.

The same principle of equity, fairness, and gratitude should now be extended to BTA employees who faithfully served the Bangsamoro Government during the transition phase. The gratuity is **not an incentive, but a form of compensatory and humanitarian assistance**, recognizing the sacrifices made by those who have contributed to peacebuilding, governance, and the establishment of the BARMM’s institutions.

To ensure fiscal responsibility and transparency, this bill provides an Appropriation Clause authorizing the use of available Bangsamoro Government Fund and unobligated balances for its initial implementation, with future allocations incorporated in the annual budget of the Bangsamoro Government. The *MFBM, as fund administrator, shall ensure compliance with accounting, auditing, and reporting standards*.

This proposed legislation embodies the government’s commitment to moral governance, compassion, and social justice. It guarantees that those who served in good faith throughout the transition shall not be left behind as the Bangsamoro Government enters its new and regular phase.

In view of the foregoing, the immediate passage of this bill is earnestly sought.

Be it enacted by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament in session assembled:


**SECTION 1. Short Title.**

This Act shall be known as the “*BTA Gratuity Fund Act*.”


**SECTION 2. Declaration of Policy.**

It is hereby declared the policy of the Bangsamoro Government to uphold the welfare and recognize the dedicated service of employees who have contributed to the transition governance of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). In pursuit of this, a Gratuity Fund shall be established to provide financial assistance to personnel of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority who shall be separated from service upon the termination of the transition period.


**SECTION 3. Definition of Terms.**

For purposes of this Act, the following terms are hereby defined:

a. *Gratuity* – refers to a form of financial assistance (one-time financial benefit) granted by the Government to an employee who is separated from service, usually due to retirement, non-absorption, or abolition of office, as an expression of appreciation and recognition for faithful, efficient, and loyal service, and not as a matter of right or demandable claim. It is distinct from retirement, separation, or terminal leave benefits.

b. *Permanent Employee* – refers to an individual who holds a position in the BTA duly approved by the Parliament and whose appointment has been attested by the Civil Service Commission for BARMM (CSC-BARMM), enjoying security of tenure until separation or retirement in accordance with existing laws and regulations.

c. *Contractual Employee* – refers to an individual whose employment is covered by a contract of service or job order within the BTA, performing specific functions for a definite period, and whose compensation is charged against the approved budget of the Office.

d. *Co-terminous Employee* – refers to an individual whose employment is co-terminous with the tenure of the appointing authority, project, or program under which he or she is employed, and whose services are automatically terminated upon expiration or cessation thereof.

e. *Separation from Service* – refers to the cessation of employment due to the expiration of the transition period or the non-absorption of personnel in the regular structure of the Bangsamoro Government.

**SECTION 4. Coverage.**

This Act shall cover all permanent, contractual, and co-terminous employees of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority who are in the service of the Bangsamoro Government upon the termination of the transition period, regardless of employment status, provided they have rendered at least one (1) year of continuous service.

**SECTION 5. Qualification and Validation.**

The qualification of employees to be granted gratuity benefits under this Act shall be determined by the Human Resource Management Unit (HRMU) in coordination with the Civil Service Commission for BARMM (CSC-BARMM), based on verified employment records, service duration, and performance evaluation.

**SECTION 6. Computation of Gratuity Benefits.**

The grant of gratuity benefits under this Act shall be equivalent to one (1) month salary for every year of government service, based on the highest monthly basic salary rate received by the employee during his or her period of service.

A fraction of at least six (6) months of service shall be considered as one (1) whole year for purposes of computing the gratuity. The computation shall be based on

verified service records and salary certifications duly validated by the HRMU in coordination with the CSC-BARMM.

**SECTION 7. Administration of the Fund.**

The Ministry of Finance, and Budget and Management (MFBM) shall administer the Gratuity Fund, formulate the necessary implementing guidelines, and ensure that payments are properly documented and supported by verified personnel and payroll records.

**SECTION 8. Appropriation Clause.**

To ensure fiscal responsibility and transparency, the amount necessary for the initial implementation of this Act shall be sourced from available Bangsamoro Government funds, including unobligated balances, subject to existing budgeting, accounting, and auditing rules and regulations.

Subsequent appropriations shall be included in the annual Bangsamoro Appropriations Act as may be deemed necessary.

**SECTION 9. Prohibition on Double Compensation and Reemployment.**

Employees who have received gratuity benefits under this Act shall not be entitled to any other form of separation or retirement benefits for the same period of service.

Reemployment in any plantilla or permanent position in the Bangsamoro Government or the National Government, including government-owned or controlled corporations, shall not be allowed within a period of five (5) years, unless the gratuity benefits received are fully refunded to the Government.

However, this prohibition shall not apply to reemployment under consultancy, contractual, co-terminous, or temporary positions, provided that such engagement does not entitle the concerned individual to additional separation or retirement benefits for the same period of service covered by the gratuity.

**SECTION 10. Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR).**

Within sixty (60) days from the effectivity of this Act, the MFBM, in coordination with the CSC-BARMM, shall promulgate the necessary rules and regulations to implement the provisions of this Act.
