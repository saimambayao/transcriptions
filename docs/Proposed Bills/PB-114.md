**AN ACT**
**INTEGRATING PALLIATIVE AND HOSPICE CARE INTO THE BANGSAMORO HEALTH CARE SYSTEM**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Imām Ibn al-Qayyim (died 752 AH, rahimahullāh) stated: “Health is one of the most precious favours Allah has bestowed upon His servants, the most generous of gifts, the most plentiful of His bounties. Rather, even more, [good] health is the most precious of favours without exception, so it is fitting that whoever is granted a portion of this fortune that he cherishes it, preserves it and guards it against harm.”

However, with an aging world population and the escalating incidence of communicable and non-communicable diseases, the demand for the end of life and palliative care is increasing every year. Unfortunately, a big fraction of patients in need of end of life and palliative care cannot afford such services which is why some prefer to die in their homes.

The Universal Health Care Act declares it a policy of the State to adopt a health care model that provides all its constituents access to a comprehensive set of palliative health services without causing financial hardship and prioritizes the needs of the population who cannot afford such services. Meanwhile, it is the policy of the Bangsamoro Government to establish by law a general hospital system to serve the health requirements of its people and ensure that the individual basic right to life shall be attainable through the prompt intervention of excellent and affordable medical services.

Due to the foregoing, immediate passage of this bill is earnestly requested.
