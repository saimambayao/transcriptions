Declaration of Policy.** - (a) It is hereby declared the policy of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao that its territorial and political subdivisions shall enjoy genuine and meaningful local autonomy to enable them to attain full development as self-reliant communities and become effective partners in the attainment of holistic Bangsamoro development. Toward this end, the Bangsamoro Government, pursuant to the principles of moral governance, shall provide for a more responsive and accountable local government structure instituted through a system of decentralization whereby constituent local government units shall be given more powers, authority, responsibilities, and resources in a gradual and systematic approach. The process of decentralization shall proceed from the Bangsamoro regional government to its constituent local government units.

b) It is likewise a policy of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region that regional agencies and offices conduct mandatory public consultations with the constituent local government units, non-governmental and people's organizations, and other concerned sectors of the community, before any project or program is approved for implementation by the concerned regional agencies, offices, or government-owned or -controlled corporations in their respective jurisdictions.

c) Finally, the mandatory public consultations required for the implementation of all programs and projects funded by the National Government in the constituent local government units of the BARMM shall be governed by policies that may be enacted by the Bangsamoro Government, subject to agreement by the National and the Bangsamoro Government through the Intergovernmental Relations Body, in accordance with Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. ²

(k) The realization of local autonomy shall be facilitated through improved coordination of regional government policies and programs and extension of adequate financial, technical, and material assistance to less developed and deserving constituent local government units;

(l) The participation of the private sector in local governance, particularly in the delivery of basic services, shall be strengthened to ensure the viability of local autonomy as a primary regional strategy for sustainable Bangsamoro development; and

(m) The Bangsamoro Government shall ensure that gradual decentralization contributes to the continuing improvement of the performance of constituent local government units and the quality of life of the Bangsamoro people.

**SECTION 4. Scope of Application.** - This Code shall apply to all constituent provinces, cities, municipalities, barangays, and other political subdivisions as may be created by law, and, to the extent herein provided, officials, offices, or agencies of the Bangsamoro Government.
