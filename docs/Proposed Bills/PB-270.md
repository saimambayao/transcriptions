Be it enacted by the Parliament of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao Assembled:

**SECTION 1. Short Title.** This Act shall be known as the “Bangsamoro Bereavement Leave Act”.

**SEC. 2. Bereavement Leave.** An employee, whether regular, casual, or contractual, in a public office or a private establishment, shall be granted a bereavement leave of five (5) days with half pay following the death of his or her immediate family member.

**SEC. 3. Immediate Family, defined.** An immediate family member of an employee shall be his or her:
a) biological/adopted parent/s;
b) biological/adopted child/ren;
c) sibling/s.

**SEC. 4. Period of Availment.** The employee shall avail of the bereavement leave within two (2) days from the death of the immediate family member. The failure to immediately avail of the bereavement leave within the said period shall be considered as a waiver thereof.

In cases where a bereavement leave or a similar benefit granted by the public office or private establishment through a company policy, a CBA, law, or a similar document is greater or more beneficial to the employee, the latter shall take precedence over this law.
