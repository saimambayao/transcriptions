**SECTION 148. Time of Payment** - The fees imposed under this Article shall be paid by the applicant upon filing of the application, or upon requesting for laboratory testing, certificates, or other services.

**SECTION 149. Administrative Provisions.** —In the implementation of this Article, the following provisions shall be observed:

(a) Procedure for Collection. — The fees under this Article shall be collected by the MPW on behalf of the Bangsamoro Government. The MPW shall have the authority to promulgate rules for the effective implementation of this Article.

All payments due to the BTO shall be deposited by the MPW to the proper account of the former immediately upon payment if the payment is made through a bank, or within the day or the next banking day from collection if physical payment is made directly to the latter.

All COs of the MPW shall deposit intact all their collections, as well as collections turned over to them by sub-collectors/tellers, with the AGDB daily or not later than the next banking day. Where collections are minimal and daily deposit thereof becomes costly and impractical, the COs shall deposit their collections at least once a week, or as soon as the collections reach ten thousand pesos (PhP 10,000.00).

(b) Submission of Permit Copy. - All responsible agencies/ministries and/or local governments that have issued any of the permits covered under this Article shall submit a copy of such permits within ten (10) calendar days after the end of each calendar month to the Bangsamoro Treasurer.

**ARTICLE 4 - Fees and Charges on Economic Zone-Related Services**

**SECTION 150. Imposition of Fees.** - There shall be levied, assessed, and collected, from every applicant, reasonable fees and charges for services rendered in connection with the processing and issuance of all the permits required and the performance of other regulatory functions. The Bangsamoro Economic Zone Authority (BEZA) shall collect the fees and shall remit the same to the BTO, based on the following schedule:

(c) Istina’a Combined with Ijarah. —This refers to a mode of financing where the IFI, after executing an Istina’a contract with the manufacturer, developer or builder (i.e., contractor), enters into an Ijarah contract with the client under which the IFI or Other Covered Person receives advance payment of rent of the asset during the construction or manufacturing period before completion of the asset (Ijarah Mawsoofa Bil Thimma): *Provided*, That the pre-paid rentals must be applied against the rentals due once the lessee starts to use the asset. After completion of the asset, an Ijarah contract may be executed with the client for the regular payment of rent for the use of the asset, ending in ownership of the asset after the lease period (Ijarah Wa Iqtina).

**SECTION 265. Neutral Tax Treatment of Istisna’a Structures.** — The economic substance of Istisna’a financing, whether structured as a Parallel Istisna’a or combined with Ijarah, is equivalent to a conventional mortgage loan between the IFI or Other Covered Person and the client.

Profits generated by the enterprise or the asset are shared in accordance with the terms of the Musharakah contract while losses are shared in proportion to each partner’s capital contribution; and

(b) Diminishing Musharakah. —This refers to a partnership contract and a mode of financing the acquisition of a specified asset where one of the partners (i.e., the client) gives a separate binding promise to buy the equity shares of the other partner(s) (i.e., the IFI) in the partnership gradually until all equity is completely transferred to him or her, at a price based on the market value or as agreed upon at the time of acquisition: *Provided*, That the sale of the shares shall be documented in a separate agreement independent of the Musharakah contract. A Diminishing Musharakah may be combined with an Ijarah contract under which the IFI or Other Covered Person leases its share of the asset to the client in exchange for periodic rental payments. In this hybrid structure, the client’s periodic payment to the IFI or Other Covered Person represents both: (i) the acquisition of the IFI’s or Other Covered Person’s share in the property; and (ii) rental payment for renting the IFI’s or Other Covered Person’s share in the property. As the client’s share in the property increases, the rent paid will decrease correspondingly.

**SECTION 267.

**SECTION 268. Neutral Tax Treatment of Diminishing Musharakah Transactions.** — The economic substance of a Musharakah financing is equivalent to a conventional mortgage loan.

(c) Gain or Profit Received. — The gain or profit derived by the IFI or Other Covered Person from the Diminishing Musharakah transaction is the difference between: (i) the selling price (plus any acquisition costs) paid by the IFI or Other Covered Person for the acquisition of the asset; and (ii) the total periodic rentals plus the additional amount fixed in the contract or the additional amount to purchase the property at market value at the end of the lease.

Profits earned by the partnership beyond a certain benchmark amount may be assigned to the Mudarib as an incentive or performance fee, either totally or partially through a higher profit-sharing ratio in favor of the Mudarib, than the one applied to partnership profits up to such benchmark; and

   (2) In the second tier, the IFI or Other Covered Person assumes the role of capital provider (Rab Al Mal) by pooling the funds provided by the depositors or investors and supplying such funds to ventures of entrepreneurs who are the capital users (Mudarib). The monies from the depositors or investors may be commingled with other funds deposited with the IFI’s or Other Covered Person’s or their own share capital funding, depending on the restrictions placed by the depositors or investors in the first tier of the arrangement; *Provided*, That the IFI or Other Covered Person may only be applied to or invested in ventures in a Shari’ah-compliant manner.

Under this structure, the IFI identifies the appropriate Shari’ah-compliant investments that provide maximum returns given the appropriate risk level. The relationship between the depositors and the IFI takes the form of either a restricted or an unrestricted investment account, where the restrictions relate to how the IFI use the funds in these accounts. Before entering into a transaction, the Muwakkil and the Wakil will agree on the estimated rate of profit that the Muwakkil will earn (Muwakkil Profit), which is not guaranteed or fixed, computed on the invested amount, and a Wakala Fee for the investing services of the IFI, which is a fixed amount computed on the investment to compensate for administrative expenses. On the agreed investment date, the Muwakkil provides the investment amount to the Wakil, which the latter will invest in its pool of treasury funds on behalf of the Muwakkil. At the maturity date, if the pool of treasury funds overperforms, the Wakil returns the invested amount along with the agreed profit payable to the Muwakkil and retains the excess profits over and above the agreed profit rate as an incentive or performance fee. If the treasury funds underperform and the estimated rate of profit is deemed not achievable, there is an early termination of the transaction, in which case the uninvested portion of the investment amount is returned to the Muwakkil, while the invested funds will be arranged for liquidation and returned to the Muwakkil along with any profit earned in the amount limited to the estimated rate of profit.
