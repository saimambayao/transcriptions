**AN ACT INSTITUTIONALIZING CONFLICT SENSITIVITY IN THE DIFFERENT PLANNING PROCESSES THROUGHOUT THE HIERARCHIES OF THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT**

**Section 1. Title.** – This Act shall be known as the “*Conflict Sensitive Planning in the Bangsamoro Act of 2022.*”

**Section 2. Declaration of Policy.** – It is the policy of the Bangsamoro Government to establish and sustain peace and order in the region based on the principles of social justice and human rights. This means promoting moral governance that puts a premium on the rights and welfare of the governed, especially those at-risk and vulnerable, during and after armed conflicts and incidents of violence. It also includes pursuing a sustainable development framework that gives due consideration to the marginalized groups.

Consistent with this policy, the Bangsamoro Government shall ensure multisectoral participation in the planning processes, including the representation of women, internally displaced persons, other vulnerable sectors, and peace and development actors.

Towards this end, the Bangsamoro Government shall institutionalize conflict sensitivity in the different planning processes throughout its hierarchies to prevent or mitigate possible harms that may be caused by government programs, projects, activities, and all other interventions in the region.

**Section 3. Definition of Terms.** – As used in this Act:

a. *Armed conflict* – A narrower category of conflict where parties on both sides resort to the use of force.
b. *Conflict* – The pursuit of incompatible goals by different groups. Applies whether by peaceful means or use of force.
c. *Conflict Analysis* – A structured inquiry into the causes and potential trajectory of a conflict that seeks to identify opportunities for managing and resolving disputes. It integrates conflict sensitivity into a broad range of development, humanitarian, and peacebuilding activities.
d. *Conflict Assessment* – The first step to the broader conflict analysis process where qualitative and quantitative analytical tools are used to address questions about the conflict. Offers a snapshot of a conflict at a particular time.
e. *Conflict Sensitivity* – The ability to:
1. Understand the context in which you operate;
2. Understand the interaction between your intervention and the context; and
3. Act upon the understanding of this interaction, to avoid negative impacts and maximize positive impacts.
f. *Do No Harm* – An approach that recognizes the presence of ‘dividers’ and ‘connectors’ in conflict. It seeks to analyze how an intervention may be implemented in a way that supports local communities to address the underlying causes of conflict rather than exacerbating conflict.
g. *Violent conflict* – Similar to armed conflict but also includes one-sided violence such as those committed against unarmed civilians and violence associated with criminality.

**Section 4. Scope.** – This Act shall primarily cover all provincial, city, and municipal governments, and barangays in the Bangsamoro, the Ministry of Interior and Local Government, and all other concerned ministries, agencies, and instrumentalities involved in the preparation of the Comprehensive Development Plan (CDP), Contingency Plan (CP), and Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan (DRRMP).

Whenever practicable, the principles of conflict sensitivity and Do No Harm (DNH) may be applied to other planning processes of the Bangsamoro Government and its constituent local government units.


**ARTICLE I**
**GENERAL PROVISIONS**

**Section 5. Bangsamoro Peace and Order Status Report.** – Within twelve (12) months from the promulgation of the Internal Rules and Regulations (IRR) of this Act, the Bangsamoro Regional Peace and Order Council (BRPOC) shall prepare a Bangsamoro Peace and Order Status Report that shall serve as an annual conflict analysis for the region. The Report shall include conflict assessments of ongoing armed or violent conflicts in the region. Capacities of the Bangsamoro Government, its ministries, agencies, and offices to prevent, manage, resolve, and transform conflict shall also be evaluated. It shall also identify areas that: (1) have ongoing or active protracted armed conflict, (2) are conflict-affected, and (3) are vulnerable to armed conflict or incidence of violence.

In accordance with the iterative nature of conflict analysis, the BRPOC shall revisit and revise the Bangsamoro Peace and Order Status Report on a bi-annual basis to account for changing conflict factors, and periodically present and/or submit the same to the Bangsamoro Parliament.

**Section 6. Local Conflict Analyses.** – Bangsamoro constituent LGUs shall conduct their own conflict analyses to understand existing conflicts and how factors affect the conflict dynamics in the area. Local conflict analysis reports shall inform local planning processes and help identify capacities for intervention. Such conduct of local conflict analysis shall be integrated into the existing planning processes and considered as a necessary step prior to the conduct of planning activities. For specific areas identified in the Report pursuant to the immediately preceding section of this Act, the conduct of a conflict analysis shall be indispensable.

Additional conflict analyses may be conducted by the constituent LGUs for other purposes when warranted or on as-needed basis.

Finally, in the case of Barangay LGUs (BLGUs), a conflict assessment shall be sufficient to determine the peace and conflict situation in their respective jurisdictions.

**Section 7. Key Elements of Conflict Analysis.** – The Bangsamoro Government, in consultation with government and non-government experts, may freely design or otherwise determine the contents of its conflict analysis, or choose to adopt or combine existing frameworks used by practitioners. However, a conflict analysis must contain the following key elements:
a. Self-assessment;
b. Profile of the area, issue or conflict;
c. Drivers of conflict;
d. Capacities for peace;
e. Actors or stakeholders analysis; and
f. Dynamics, windows, and scenarios.

**Section 8. Objectives of Conflict Analysis.** – A conflict analysis may be used to:
a. Assess conflict and intervention capacity;
b. Strategically design the objectives of the intervention prior to implementation;
c. Assess the impact of a specific intervention;
d. Raise awareness of implementing partners engaged in a development or peacebuilding initiative of the linkages between their work and the conflict dynamics of the area where they are working; or
e. Engage in dialogue between local government and communities about visions for peace and development priorities.

**Section 9. Bangsamoro Conflict Monitoring System.** – The Bangsamoro Conflict Monitoring System (BCMS) shall be revived to serve as the repository of data, information, and analyses on conflicts in the region. It shall be expanded to contain, among others, sectoral and cross-sectoral analysis within the context of peace and conflict, situation analyses, conflict and actors/stakeholder maps, and drivers of peace and conflict. The BCMS shall be linked to existing regional and local planning databases.

To safeguard the integrity and quality of data, public and private research or academic institutions may be engaged to serve as data and knowledge hubs. These hubs shall assist in collecting, processing, and analyzing peace and conflict data in a particular area.

**Section 10. Conflict Sensitivity Capacity Development Program.** – Within three (3) months from the presentation and submission of the Report to the Parliament, the BRPOC shall design a comprehensive capacity development program to address the gaps in the Bangsamoro Government’s capacities for peace. The comprehensive capacity development program shall guide the Bangsamoro Government and its constituent LGUs in conducting capacity development activities. Bangsamoro officials, officers, and personnel involved in the various planning processes shall be required to participate in such capacity development activities.

**Section 11. Assistance from Peace Partners.** – In carrying out the objectives of this Act, the Bangsamoro Government may seek assistance from the National Government and its agencies. Among others, the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace, Reconciliation, and Unity may be tapped for its technical expertise.

Similarly, non-government peace actors with a proven track record and competence may also be engaged to provide technical assistance to the Bangsamoro Government or its constituent LGUs.

Finally, the assistance of international peace, humanitarian, and/or development organizations shall be encouraged. The Bangsamoro Government shall set up a mechanism to facilitate their assistance.

**Section 12. Prioritization of Conflict Sensitive Policies, Programs, Projects, and Activities.** – LGUs shall prioritize crafting policies that are based on robust conflict analysis. Programs, projects, and activities that are results of ex-ante conflict analyses shall be given priority in terms of approval and resource allocation.

**Section 13. Lead Body.** – The BRPOC shall take the lead in ensuring compliance with the provisions of this Act. Authorities and responsibilities not expressly mentioned in this Act that are deemed reasonable and necessary to effectively implement this Act shall fall under the MILG.
