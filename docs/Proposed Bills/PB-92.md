**Section 1. Short Title.** – This Act shall be known as the **"Bangsamoro Housing Act."**

**Section 2. Declaration of Policy.** – Pursuant to the mandate of Republic Act No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), there shall be developed a comprehensive and integrated housing program which shall embrace, among others, housing development and resettlement, sources and schemes of financing, and delineation of government and private sector participation. The program shall specify the priorities and targets in accordance with the integrated human settlements plan prepared by the Ministry of Human Settlements and Development (MHSD) and local shelter plans to be created by the LGUs.

In the preparation of said program, the following factors shall be considered:

a) The management of urban development to promote the economic and social well-being and physical mobility of the people, and facilitate industrial growth and dispersal;
b) The conservation of land for housing development as well as the regulation of land use to achieve optimum utilization patterns;
c) The organization of public and private resources into financial intermediaries to meet the demand for housing, including provisions for incentives and facilities to broaden the private sector participation in housing investments; and
d) The extensive use of building systems, which shall maximize the use of indigenous materials and reduce building costs without sacrificing sound engineering and environmental standards.

**Section 3. Creation and Mandate of the Bangsamoro Housing Office.** – There is hereby created a government agency to be known as the Bangsamoro Housing Office (BHO), hereinafter referred to as the Office. The Office shall act as the primary Bangsamoro Government entity responsible for developing and implementing a comprehensive and integrated housing development and resettlement program. It shall be the sole Bangsamoro Government agency engaged in direct shelter production. The Office shall have its principal office in the Bangsamoro Government Center in Cotabato City. A satellite office shall also be created in each of the provinces of Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi and in other areas as it may be proper and necessary.

The Office shall be an attached agency of the MHSD.

**Section 4. Definition of Terms.** – As used in this Act:

a) ***Attachment*** refers to the lateral relationship between a department and the attached agency or corporation for purposes of policy and program coordination.

b) ***Housing*** refers to a multidimensional concept relating to the process of residing and the objects of dwelling whose main attributes are location relative to access to livelihood, tenure, arrangements, cost and physical structure, as well as their environment. Housing is likewise a physical structure as well as social structure, functioning at different spatial scales from homes, neighborhoods, communities, municipalities, cities, provinces, and regions. It is also a sector of the economy, an important category of land in both urban and rural areas, especially in cities, and is an important factor in the overall dynamics of the urban system. In the construction of houses in the Bangsamoro Region, the customs, beliefs, and traditions of the Bangsamoro people are recognized, protected, and guaranteed. The Bangsamoro Government shall also recognize and protect the rights of the indigenous peoples as provided for in the Organic Law. For Muslims, houses must make easy the privacy and protection of the family members inside the house's domain. As a minimum requirement, every Muslim house should have a room for parents, another room for female children, and another room for male children. Further, Muslim house designs should consider the *qiblah* direction. For Indigenous People, the traditional dwellings are stilt houses made out of native materials like nipa, bamboo, and coconut leaves.

(a) living in a lot, whether private or public, without the consent of the property owner; or
(b) those without legal claim over the property they are occupying; or
