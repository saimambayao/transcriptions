**AN ACT INSTITUTIONALIZING THE EMPOWERMENT AND WELFARE OF ULAMA, USTADHS, USTADHAS, INDIGENOUS SPIRITUAL LEADERS, AND OTHER FAITH-BASED COUNSELORS IN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

The Doctors of the Soul Act of 2025 represents a landmark legislative initiative aimed at institutionalizing the indispensable role of Ulama, Ustadhs, Ustadhas, Indigenous spiritual leaders, priests, pastors, and other faith-based counselors as primary providers of psycho-spiritual support within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). Fundamentally recognizing the holistic nature of health, this Act seeks to integrate spiritual guidance into the broader framework of mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS). Consequently, it aspires to enhance community well-being, strengthen social unity, and contribute meaningfully to peacebuilding efforts in the region.

To justify the enactment of this law, this explanatory note delineates the legal, constitutional, and theological foundations underpinning the Act. Notably, it highlights the alignment of the legislation with BARMM's foundational documents as well as key Islamic ethical principles, thereby affirming its contextual and normative legitimacy.

Foremost, the Bangsamoro Organic Law (Republic Act No. 11054), which serves as the foundational legal framework for BARMM, explicitly mandates the promotion of moral governance and cultural identity. In this regard, the Act concretizes these mandates in several significant ways. For instance, Section 3, Article XII of the Bangsamoro Organic Law charges the Bangsamoro Government with the responsibility to promote moral governance and cultural preservation. By formally recognizing and empowering Ulama and religious leaders as "Doctors of the Soul," the Act institutionalizes Islamic moral and ethical teachings within government programs, thereby ensuring that development initiatives are reflective of the values and faith of the Bangsamoro people.

Furthermore, Section 5, Article IX of the Bangsamoro Organic Law authorizes BARMM to administer social welfare services in a manner consistent with Islamic values and indigenous traditions. In response, this legislation establishes mechanisms for the certification, welfare, and deployment of faith-based counselors, thus integrating culturally appropriate psycho-spiritual support into the region's social services framework.

In addition to the Bangsamoro Organic Law, the BARMM Charter reinforces the legal basis for this Act. Specifically, Section 2, Article VII directs BARMM to provide culturally appropriate social services. This legislation fulfills that mandate by institutionalizing spiritually rooted counseling services that are congruent with the cultural and religious contexts of the Bangsamoro people, thereby enhancing the accessibility and cultural acceptability of mental health support. Moreover, Section 1, Article IV enshrines moral governance as a core principle of the Bangsamoro government. By formally incorporating Ulama and spiritual counselors into government efforts, the Act strengthens the moral component of society through the promotion of ethical and compassionate guidance.

The Act is also grounded in the traditional Islamic legal framework of Maqasid al-Shariah, which aims to preserve essential human interests. In particular, the Act upholds the preservation of religion (Hifz al-Din) by empowering Ulama and religious teachers to protect and continue Islamic faith and spiritual welfare. Simultaneously, it addresses the protection of the mind (Hifz al-’Aql) by integrating psycho-spiritual counseling as a culturally sensitive method to safeguard mental and emotional health. Lastly, it supports the preservation of life (Hifz al-Nafs) through a holistic approach to well-being that aligns with Islamic ethics and promotes the sanctity of life.

Moreover, the Islamic principle of rahmah (compassion) commands care for the vulnerable, including individuals experiencing psychological distress. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized spiritual healing and counseling as essential components of individual and communal well-being. Accordingly, this Act institutionalizes that prophetic wisdom by formally recognizing and supporting trusted spiritual guides as key contributors to mental health and psychosocial support in BARMM.

It is important to note that BARMM is characterized by a diverse ethno-religious composition, in which communities have traditionally relied on faith-based counselors for guidance, particularly concerning mental, emotional, and moral matters. Despite their critical role, these spiritual leaders have historically operated without formal recognition or adequate support from governmental systems. This legislation remedies such gaps by institutionalizing and professionalizing the role of Ulama, Ustadhs, Ustadhas, Indigenous spiritual leaders, and faith-based counselors without creating additional bureaucratic layers. In addition, the Act integrates their services into formal government programs across health, education, social welfare, and peacebuilding sectors to expand their reach and impact.

Moreover, the Act provides structured welfare benefits, training, and certification systems designed to enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of faith-based counselors. It also promotes gender inclusivity and respects Indigenous cultural practices. Through these provisions, the legislation strengthens social healing, resilience, and peacebuilding efforts by offering culturally congruent psycho-spiritual care.

Finally, the Doctors of the Soul Act of 2025 is a constitutionally grounded, culturally and religiously principled legislative framework that elevates psycho-spiritual care as a fundamental component of BARMM’s social services. By institutionalizing the empowerment, welfare, and integration of faith-based counselors, the Act affirms the Bangsamoro Government’s unwavering commitment to moral governance, holistic well-being, and the strengthening of community bonds. Ultimately, this legislation serves as a testament to BARMM’s aspiration for governance rooted in faith, ethics, and compassion, ensuring that mental health and spiritual welfare receive prioritization alongside physical and social development.
