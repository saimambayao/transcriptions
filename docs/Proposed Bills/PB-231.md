**AN ACT ESTABLISHING THE LOCAL AREA NETWORK (LAN) SYSTEM OF THE BANGSAMORO GOVERNMENT**

*Be it enacted by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament of the BARMM:*

**SECTION 1. *Short Title.*** - This Act shall be known as the "Bangsamoro LAN Act."

**SECTION 2. *Policy.*** – It is the policy of the Bangsamoro Government to support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, enhance economic prosperity and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants. It is also the policy of the Bangsamoro Government to deliver services to the inhabitants of the region in speedy, efficient, and effective manner.

**SECTION 3. *General Objectives.*** – This Act seeks to:

a. Establish in the Bangsamoro Government a fast, reliable, and economical Local Area Network (LAN) system for efficient and effective delivery of services to the inhabitants of the region;
b. Ensure the security of data of the Bangsamoro Government;

**SECTION 4. *Definition of Terms.*** – When used in this Act, the following term shall have the following meaning assigned to them:

(a) “LAN - is a computer network established within a small geographic area, such as a house, office or buildings and allow resource sharing, including printers, apps and other shared services; allow multiple devices on a LAN to share a single internet connection; and. protect LAN-connected devices using network security tools.

A local area network (LAN) is a communications system that allows the interconnection and sharing of resources between independent devices within a moderately sized geographic area

(b) “Wired LAN is also known as Ethernet LAN connection. In this type of connection, wires are used to connect the computers. It is a fast connection and latency is low in a wired connection. Latency means when you transfer data then in how much time it is received to the destination. So data reach time is low in wired LAN. In industries, Ethernet LAN is used because in this case data is not lost and each user gets a dedicated line for transferring the data. Ethernet speed is about 1gbps. Different types of equipment are used in wired LAN e.g. modem, switch, hub, router, coaxial cable is used to make wired LAN connection.

(c) Wireless LAN is also known as a Wi-Fi connection. It has low speed as compared to wired LAN. The speed of Wi-Fi follows IEEE 802.11 standards. The latency rate is high in wireless LAN that means transfer time from one location to other is high. There is a high chance that data can collapse with the other data i.e. the signals may collide with each other if many devices are sending and receiving data wirelessly.

**SECTION 5. *Establishment of LAN* ** – The Bangsamoro Government shall design and establish its Local Area Network (LAN) system that shall connect and serve all its offices including the Office of the Chief Minister, the Ministries, the Parliament, and all other agencies attached to them.
