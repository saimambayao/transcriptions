**AN ACT**
**STRENGTHENING THE ENERGY POLICIES AND MECHANISMS WITHIN THE BANGSAMORO AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES**

**EXPLANATORY NOTE**

Pursuant to Section 36, Article XIII of the Bangsamoro Organic Law, the Bangsamoro Government shall promote investments in the energy and power generation sector, domestic and international, public and private, in the power sector industry in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

Section 2 of Republic Act No. 9136 or the Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 mandates the State to ensure and accelerate the total electrification of the country; to ensure the quality, reliability, security, and affordability of the supply of electric power; and to assure socially and environmentally compatible energy sources and infrastructure.

Paving the path of transition into a more sustainable and resilient energy system, the Philippine Energy Plan (PEP) 2020-2040 was crafted and reiterates the energy sector’s goal to chart a transformative direction towards attaining a clean energy future.

The Philippine Energy Plan seeks to unify with its government partners and the private sector to meet the country’s electricity and fuel requirements through improvements in the energy market, simplification of government procedures, promotion of resiliency in energy systems and infrastructures, and the enhancements of the consumers’ power of choice.

On June 28, 2017, President Rodrigo R. Duterte issued Executive Order No. 30 to ensure the continuous, adequate, and economic supply of energy and streamline regulatory procedures affecting energy projects of national significance. EO 30 provides for the framework to create an efficient and effective administrative process for energy projects in order to avoid unnecessary delays in the implementation of the PEP.

In order to establish, strengthen, and integrate the energy policies and mechanisms within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, with respect to energy safety practices, energy efficiency and conservation, energy resiliency, energy planning which includes energy access and resource development, there is a need to harmonize and fast-track the implementation of the Ease of Doing Business Act, the Energy Virtual One-Stop Shop Act, and Executive Order No. 30, in the region.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
