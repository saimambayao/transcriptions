Towards this end, the Bangsamoro government shall establish a regional registry that would serve as a database system of informal workers within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region to address the issue on the quality of employment of these informal workers and will likewise assist the LGUs to standardize identification of recipients for relief assistance in times of disasters.

They are informal in the sense that they are for the most part unregistered and unrecorded in official statistics; they tend to have little or no access to organized markets, to credit institutions, or to many public services and amenities; they are not recognized, supported or regulated by the government; they are often compelled by circumstances to operate outside of the framework of the law and even where they are registered and respect certain aspects of the law they are almost invariably beyond the pale of social protection, labor legislation and protective measures of the workplace.

It does not cover illicit activities, in particular the provision of services or the production, sale, possession or use of goods forbidden by law, including the illicit production and trafficking of drugs, the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, trafficking in persons, and money laundering, as defined in the international treaties.
