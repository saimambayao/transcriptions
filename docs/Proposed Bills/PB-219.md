**SECTION 2. Declaration of Policy.** - It is the policy of the State to adopt and implement a policy of full public disclosure, subject to reasonable conditions prescribed by law, and to recognize the vital role of communication and information in nation-building. Further, the Bangsamoro Government adopts Moral Governance as its guiding principle in the pursuit of genuine and meaningful autonomy and ensures the necessary conditions for sustained socio-economic development by improving accountability of physical and financial outcomes of government infrastructure projects, eliminating corruption, and ensuring multi-stakeholder participation.

Pursuant to these policies, the Regional Government recognizes the importance of transparency and efficiency in project monitoring and data-based planning and programming for equity in development.

It shall also include the name of the project, the location, and the cost of the project to allow the government, the citizenry, and other stakeholders to check the progress of projects in real-time.

b) Online Portal - is a specially designed website where relevant information, images, and map visualization on all government infrastructure projects collected before, during, and after its implementation in the areas of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region are uploaded, organized, regularly updated, and accessible to the public through various platforms.

c) Infrastructure Projects - infrastructure projects and facilities being constructed by the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, including roads, bridges, ports, flood control, water supply, schools, multipurpose buildings, government buildings, hospitals, and other health facilities, barangay and municipal halls, centers, housing, and other similar horizontal and vertical projects.
