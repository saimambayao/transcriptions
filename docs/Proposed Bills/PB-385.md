a. **New Construction of Level II and Level III Potable Water System** – construction of a new water system that will include all the components mentioned above, which is sufficient to supply potable water to the target households/beneficiaries through a tap stand for Level II and household connections for Level III.
b. **Rehabilitation/Improvement of Level II/Level III Water System** – Any major repair, alteration, and/or additions of the components mentioned above of existing Level II and Level III Water System to improve the current service is provided without any increase in the number of beneficiaries (e.g., from 8-hour service distribution to 24 hours, reduction of water leakage).
c. **Upgrading of the Water Supply System** – Upgrading of the level of service of a water system, which may include alteration or addition of any water supply component mentioned above, due to the increase of water demand of households. Upgrading of a Level I to Level II and/or Level III will be categorized as ‘new construction.’
d. **Expansion of Level II/Level III Water Supply System** – Any major repair, alteration, and/or additions of the components mentioned above of existing Level II and Level III Water System to improve the current service being provided with additional beneficiaries.
e. **Construction of Level I Water Supply System** – In areas where only Level I System is feasible (e.g., rural areas where affordability is low and the houses in the intended service are not crowded or un-clustered), new construction of Level I Systems is permitted which shall include the development of the water source and provision of disinfectant.
