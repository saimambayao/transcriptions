# Chapter 5: Improving and Strengthening Governance Mechanisms for Stable, Just, and Accountable Bangsamoro Government

The BOL provides the Bangsamoro government the autonomy to exercise self-governance, powers to promote the general welfare, authority to regulate its constituent LGUs, a mechanism for resolving intergovernmental relations, a justice system in consonance with traditional laws and the Constitution, and the benefit of enjoying fiscal autonomy, among others. Most critically, the BOL designates the BTA as the interim government during the transition.

This chapter describes the Bangsamoro government's overall strategy for handling its development administration or governance sector. It supports the BARMM's enhanced 12-Point Priority Agenda 1 which aims to strengthen the bureaucracy in the region and Agenda 3 which aims to increase revenue generation and economic comparative advantages. It is also consistent with the Marcos Administration's 8-point Socioeconomic Agenda 3 - Enhance Bureaucratic Efficiency and Sound Fiscal Management; aligned with the SDG 16 — Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions; and SDG 17 — Partnerships to Achieve the Goal.

This chapter covers the six sub-sectors of the development administration sector, namely: Bureaucracy, Development Planning, Legislation, Fiscal Management, Multi-Stakeholder Engagement, and the Bangsamoro Justice System.

## Sectoral Assessment

### Sectoral Trends

The development administration as a sector under the BEDC ensures to address developmental, governance and socio-economic changes, issues, and challenges. Symbiotic with public administration, the sector is presumed to be the central part of development. Together with all other sectors, the development administration sector oversees interconnecting policies and directions of the planning, programming, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation of all development programs, projects, and services and alignment to the development initiatives of the national and local governments.

The sector is steered by the DACom and composed of BARMM MOAs mandated with administration and oversight functions.

In the 1st BDP 2020-2022, the development administration sector plays an integral part in the establishment of the BARMM bureaucracy. The establishment of the foundations for an inclusive, transparent, accountable, and efficient governance is the first of the eight BDP development goals that the BARMM government identified as vital for the attainment of the overall goal of uplifting the lives of the Bangsamoro and establishing the foundations of self-governance through moral governance.

## Bureaucracy

**Organizational strengthening gaining momentum, though gaps persist.** The change of political structure provided by BOL creates opportunities for the Bangsamoro to exercise self-governance through a parliamentary form of government. The shift from unitary to parliamentary government system supports stronger executive-legislative working relationships. Further, the merging of agencies allows for systematic and integrated interventions. Thus, issues on previously non-devolved offices were strengthened, thereby addressing government response capacities.

In 2020, 15 ministries were created and fully operationalized upon the enactment of the BAA 13 or the Bangsamoro Administrative Code. Previously, the defunct ARMM had 25 regional departments, and these were restructured during the transition of ARMM to BARMM.

The approved BAA 13 and the 1st BDP 2020-2022 stated that 33 offices would be created in the BARMM. Only 48 percent of the proposed 16 offices in the year 2020 and 55 percent of the proposed 33 offices in the years 2021 and 2022 are fully operationalized.

Since the ratification of the BOL in 2019, the Bangsamoro government utilized the budget of the defunct ARMM and the allocation for the Modified Disbursement System (MDS) and locally funded agencies is applied and operated.

All the fundamentals of institutionalizing the structure of the created offices are still in process. Further, the disparity on the scale describes that the offices created and established during the ARMM period significantly differ from BARMM, which is outlined in a parliamentary form of government.

As part of establishing the bureaucracy, the Bangsamoro government, through the MFBM, has created and authorized 50,467 positions across 15 ministries and 13 executive offices as of November 18, 2022. This includes the absorbed positions of employees from the education, health, and social services sectors. Of this number, 72.55 percent or 35,812 positions are already filled-in as of November 2022.

Meanwhile, 1,078 coterminous positions are also created mostly under the Parliament with 92.67 percent hiring rate. There are also 336 contractual plantilla positions created, but only 17.55 percent are filled-in.

**Mechanism for coordinating regional development efforts fully functional.** The BEDC as the socio-economic planning, monitoring, and coordinating agency for all development policies, plans, programs, and projects of the Bangsamoro government shall evaluate and recommend short-, medium-, and long-term comprehensive development plans, programs, and projects for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region for approval by the Parliament. The development plans, programs, and projects shall take into account the development plans of the provinces, cities, municipalities, and barangays as approved by their respective local development councils.

In 2019, the BEDC was established and tasked to focus on the socio-economic development in the BARMM together with its five committees that will assist the Council in performing its mandate and responsibilities namely: DACom, PPOSSCom, EDCom, SDCom, IDCom. It also has special committees namely: RSCom, RLUC, and RPMECom. In 2021, the Bangsamoro Gender and Development Special Committee (BGADSC) was established as a special committee on GAD.

Article VI of the BOL emphasizes the importance of intergovernmental relations (IGR) between the national government and the Bangsamoro government, specifically for the integration, coordination, and harmonization of policies, and programs.

Even though the priorities of both governments are to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic during its height, six out of eight or 71 percent of the IGR mechanisms in the BOL have already been operationalized. The other two mechanisms are the Philippines Congress - Bangsamoro Parliament Forum (PCBPF) and the Bangsamoro Sustainable Development Board (BSDB).

On November 15, 2022, the first Philippine Congress-Bangsamoro Parliament Forum (PCBPF) was convened marking another milestone in the implementation of BOL. While the BSDB was already passed into law last June 2022.

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the IGRB and other IGR mechanisms continued to fulfill their mandate of resolving IGR issues between the national government and the Bangsamoro government.

**Turnover of Cotabato City to the BARMM: A major IGRB milestone.** The most significant milestone of the IGRB was the turnover of Cotabato City to the BARMM which was eventually took effect through a ceremony on December 15, 2020 at the Shariff Kabunsuan Cultural Complex (SKCC) in the Bangsamoro Government Center (BGC), Cotabato City. This was pursuant to the directive of former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte to complete the turnover in December 2020, a year after the issue was first raised by the Bangsamoro government to the IGRB during its first consultative meeting on December 16, 2019.

The DILG and the MILG spearheaded the turnover, with consultations from the city government of Cotabato and the Bangsamoro government. During the ceremony, national government secretary of the Interior and Local Government Eduardo M. Año signed the documents for the transfer of supervision of Cotabato City to the MILG, as well as the properties, assets, and records of the DILG Cotabato City field office.

Other milestones of the IGRB include salaries of teacher and education sector employees in the SGA and in Cotabato City; Omnibus Request of the Bangsamoro government to the Civil Service Commission (CSC); creation of regional offices of the National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM), Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP), and Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) in the BARMM; establishment of Bangsamoro Electoral Office (BEO); participation of the Bangsamoro government in the national development planning; and transfer of existing natural reserves and protected areas to the Bangsamoro government.

In 2021, 59 percent of the 70 LGUs in BARMM were compliant with the seven elements of LGUs functionality, compared to 50 percent in 2020. However, in 2019, data were not provided due to the transition process.

The island provinces registered a relatively low compliance with LGU functionality due to its geographic disadvantages. The mobility, connectivity, insufficiency of facilities, and the scarcity of construction-imposed materials are among the challenges in terms of the service delivery in the area.

The BARMM has high hopes that it will increase its number of functional LGUs, particularly those in the island provinces. The recent opening of routes such as the Cotabato to Tawi-Tawi flight routes and taking advantage of the Tawi-Tawi as the front door to the BIMP-EAGA will significantly change the status of concerned LGUs in BARMM.

**Transforming governance through Bangsamoro local government incentives and awards.** The BARMM through the MILG evaluates the functionality of LGUs through the following seven elements: presence of a government center with facilities; presence of working elected and appointed mandatory officials and functionaries; functional local special bodies; functional local legislative body; approved mandated plans and budget; availability of basic services; and sound fiscal management.

The Seal of Good Local Governance (SGLG) puts a high premium on integrity and good performance as pillars of meaningful local autonomy and development. Of the total LGUs, 28 were awarded in 2019 compared to the 23 in 2018. The province of Maguindanao got the most awardees, followed by Lanao del Sur. Limited mobility due to COVID-19 pandemic, MILG suspended the awarding of SGLG in 2020 and 2021. In 2022, a total of 14 LGUs were awarded with SGLG including one from Basilan, ten from Maguindanao, two from Lanao del Sur, and Lamitan City.

Despite the few percentages of awardees, the slight increase from 2018 to 2019 was a good indication for the Bangsamoro government's effort in pushing its constituent LGUs to perform. However, progress was impeded due to challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, which triggered the DILG national to suspend the SGLG assessment process in all regions.

Guided by principles and advancing moral governance in the Bangsamoro, the Salamat Excellence Award for Leadership (SEAL) was launched in 2020 inspired by the documentation of life story and leadership principle and practices of Amerul Mujaheedin, and development of excellence award for Local Chief Executives (LCEs) who have demonstrated similar passion for the welfare of Bangsamoro people.

A total of six LCEs in 2020 across the BARMM were awarded for showing exemplary leadership practices in emulating accountable, participatory, and service-oriented leadership which have verifiable impact to the achievement of the four core strategies in running public organizations. The Bangsamoro government continues its efforts in delivering and inspiring more LCEs to gain such awards. To date, a total of seven LCEs have gained the prestigious SEAL award with five finalists in the year 2021.

Since July 25, 2022 to August 26, 2022, the application and nomination for the SEAL has officially opened to all LCEs that are qualified and have met the requirements based on MILG MC No. 125, series of 2022 re: Guidelines in the Implementation of SEAL Program CY 2022.

Barangay Kauran in Ampatuan, Maguindanao, was the first awardee in the BARMM that received the first runner-up for the 4-6th class municipalities category of the Lupong Tagapamayapa Incentives Award (LTIA) for CY 2022 during the national awards ceremony held on November 28, 2022 at The Manila Hotel, Ermita, Manila.

LTIA is a system of providing economic benefits and other incentives to outstanding Lupong Tagapamayapa, the body that comprises the Katarungang Pambarangay or Barangay Justice System, established to settle minor cases involving barangay residents outside of the courts that demonstrate exemplary performance in resolving disputes at the grassroots or barangay level.

On anti-drug campaign efforts for the year 2022, a total of six LGUs hailed as national awardees for the Anti-Drug Abuse Council (ADAC) Performance Audit. The award is in recognition of the exemplary performance in the implementation of all anti-illegal drug programs, projects, and activities of the LGUs.

The search continues with the implementation of the 3rd annual LGU Grant Assistance for Innovative Practices (LGAIP) that aims to highlight LGU innovative practices at the regional level, making it a benchmark for strategies that LGUs may utilize in delivering quality services through innovative means despite the challenges being faced by the local governance. The MILG conducted the final screening process for the shortlisted 10 applicants of the program and was able to identify innovative practices worthy of the award and secure agreement between the winning parties and the ministry. To date, a total of 14 LGUs have been awarded with LGAIP award.

The Search for Model Barangays (SMB) is the newest incentive program of the MILG that aims to recognize barangays with exemplary performance and to serve as fine examples and inspirations on good governance among the 2,590 barangays in the region.

Barangay Rempes in Upi, Maguindanao was declared the first Model Barangay Awardee for CY 2021 and received Php1 million and building marker as incentives. A total of 11 barangays were awarded as Model Barangay for CY 2022.

The shortlisted barangays are also passers of the SGLG for Barangay (SGLGB) and LTIA, garnered IDEAL rating for the Local Government Functionality Appraisal for Barangay (LoGFA-B), and have the HIGH or IDEAL rating of Functionality Audit for the Barangay Based-Institutions as pre-requisite to be eligible to this award.

The LoGFA and Performance Assessment Scorecard System (PASS) are the performance oversight assessment tools that intend to assess the functionality of LGUs in BARMM. These tools aim to assess the LGUs, particularly on the abovementioned seven elements of functionality as implementing tool for the LoGFA. A total of 57 LGUs in 2020, 66 in 2021, and 59 in 2022 with Ideal Functionality were awarded under the LoGFA.

**More LGUs compliant to Seal of Good Financial Housekeeping (SGFH).** In 2019, a total of 89 LGUs in the BARMM were awarded with SGFH, accounting for 75 percent of the total number of LGUs.

Maguindanao provincial office passed the SGFH standards with only a few barangays not fully compliant. Remarkably, in 2021, despite the challenges due to the breakout of COVID-19 in the previous year, which impeded the progress of the program. The province is now completely recognized with a hundred percent SGFH compliant. Followed by the province of Lanao del Sur with 29 LGUs or 74 percent, in 2019 and 22 LGUs or 56 percent, in 2021. Similarly, the majority of the functional LGUs across the Bangsamoro region were awarded with SGFH, which implies a respectable change compared with preceding years.

**More LGUs are compliant to the Full Disclosure Policy (FDP).** The MILG sustained the drive for greater LGU transparency and accountability with 98 LGUs in 2019, 103 in 2020, and 102 in 2021 compliant with FDP.

Pursuant to the mandate of the MILG to assist the Chief Minister in exercising general supervision over the constituent LGUs of BARMM, one of the fundamentals of the regulatory dimensions of such supervision is compliance to government policies. Progress in compliance among LGUs to national and regional policies was demonstrated.

The compliance of LGUs to national and regional policies is regularly monitored using the Performance Audit and Compliance Tracking System (PACTS). From 2020-2021, the number of PACTS passers in the BARMM slightly improved from 33 LGUs to 43 functional LGUs. Among the LGUs, Cotabato City has been consistent and strictly complying with the policy despite the pandemic in 2020.

Under PACTS, the acquiescence of the 10-Policy Areas is regularly monitored in the level of the LGUs, namely: 1) Full Disclosure of Local Budget and Finances, and Bids and Public Offerings, 2) Attendance of Local Chief Executives, 3) Sanggunian Functionality, 4) Attendance of Local Authorities, 5) Implementation of the five percent disaster risk reduction and management fund (DRRMF), 6) Local Special Bodies, 7) Physical Implementation and Utilization of 20 percent Development Fund, 8) Submission of Annual Accomplishment Report, 9) Ecological Solid Waste Management (ESWM), and 10) Provincial Development and Physical Framework Plan (PPDFP)/ Comprehensive Development Plan (CDP).

**Inconsistent trend in terms of compliance to mandated plans.** In terms of PDPFP, the data shows that there is a fluctuating trend of performance in 2021 with only two compliant LGUs or 40 percent in comparison to the 2020 figures where only four provincial offices or 80 percent out of five have complied.

Province of Maguindanao had the highest number of LGUs that submitted comprehensive land use plan (CLUP) from 2020 to 2021. On the other hand, the preparation of CLUP must be prioritized by every LGU, as only 45 LGUs accomplished this in 2021, compared to 50 in 2020.

**Presence of Government Centers with Facilities.** In order for local government centers to be classified as functional, data on presence of government centers with facilities serve as the basis. Increase and decrease in the numbers through the years can be attributed to Bangsamoro Government interventions through Support to Local Moral Governance (SLMG) program, and a more stringent inventory of facilities.

## Development Planning

**Regular plans formulated and adopted in the BARMM for the year 2019 to 2022.** The BPDA, as a technical arm of the Bangsamoro government, had formulated three regular plans for the past three years and were adopted by the BEDC. In 2020, the 1st BDP, 2022-2025 was formulated and adopted, while, the Bangsamoro Response and Recovery Plan (BRRP) and the Camp Transformation Plan (CTP) were adopted in the year 2021. The mentioned preceding plans were crafted and aligned to the BARMM 12-point priority agenda in realization of the Bangsamoro government's overall goal of uplifting the lives of the Bangsamoro people through moral governance.

As a key component for achieving moral governance, the Bangsamoro government ensures formulating relevant and responsive plans. The 1st BDP was primarily set to achieve its overall goal of uplifting the lives of the Bangsamoro people through moral governance, and the development planning keeps its tract gearing towards the Philippine long-term vision — Ambisyon Natin 2040. The BRRP was also formulated in response to the COVID-19 outbreak in the region, while the CTP is strongly anchored to the normalization process under the CAB to fulfill the moral obligation of the Bangsamoro.

## Legislation

The BTA is mandated to exercise the powers granted to it under Section 5, Article VII of the BOL. One of the functions of the parliament is to enact laws to promote, protect, and ensure the general welfare of the Bangsamoro people and other inhabitants in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

As of 2021, three of the seven priority codes were already enacted. In 2020, out of seven priority codes only the Bangsamoro Administrative Code was signed into law by the Parliament on October 28, 2020. In 2021, two additional codes were signed into law, namely, the Bangsamoro Civil Service Code, which was approved by the Parliament on February 24, 2021, and the Bangsamoro Education Code which was enacted on May 18, 2021. To date, the Members of the Parliament are working on the four remaining priority codes.

A total of 260 out of 748 resolutions or 34.75 percent were approved from 2019 to 2022. A total of 31 out of 184 or 16.84 percent of bills filed were approved by the Parliament from 2019 to 2022.

---

## Fiscal Management

The grant of fiscal autonomy as provided in Section 1, Article XII of RA 11054 paved for an exercise of self-governance not only in policy-setting but also in resource mobilization and expenditure management. Through fiscal autonomy, the Bangsamoro government is given the power to create sources of revenues besides the annual block grant provided by the national government, as well as exercise budget autonomy to ensure that these resources are spent in programmatic, transparent, performance-based, and phased manner.

The annual block grant is consistently the largest source of revenues from 2020 to 2022, accounting almost 90 percent of the total resources. This was followed by the Special Development Fund (SDF) which accounts for about seven percent of total revenues. Local collections registered the lowest contribution, accounting for less than one percent of total revenues.

Among the main causes that explain the erratic movement in the revenue collections of BARMM is the absence of enabling legislation, i.e., the Revenue Code. Its establishment will have a high impact on those agencies with collecting authority by further improving the management and mechanisms of imposition of the required tax, fees, and charges within the power conferred by the BOL. Thus, its effect is direct to local revenue collections which will improve tax revenues (i.e., regional wealth tax, contractors' tax, travel tax), regional fees and charges, and other revenues.

Furthermore, external factors also affect the increase/decrease of the revenue sources of BARMM as these are already provided in RA 11054.

First, the amount of the block grant shall be equivalent to five percent of the net national internal revenue tax collection of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and the net collection of the Bureau of Customs (BOC) from the third fiscal year immediately preceding the current fiscal year. Necessarily, the amount of annual block grants is directly dependent on the collections made by the national government. For instance, as an effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, which resulted in the dramatic decrease of the Philippine economy, hints at a lower revenue collection by the national government.

Second, the national government shall provide SDF to the Bangsamoro government for the rebuilding, rehabilitation, and development of its conflict-affected communities. The amount equivalent to Fifty Billion pesos (Php50,000,000,000.00), at five billion pesos (Php5,000,000,000.00) per year, for a period of 10 years from the ratification of the BOL, shall be allocated for this purpose.

Lastly, the share of the Bangsamoro government in the taxes collected by the national government is 75 percent inclusive of the shares of the constituent LGUs.

### Actual Expenditures

As a new government conferred with fiscal autonomy, the Bangsamoro government is placed in a strategic position which enables it to manage expenditures based on development interventions that truly responds to the peculiar needs of the region. What comes with this opportunity is the immense responsibility of the regional government to ensure that the spending of resources is not only aligned with the development direction of the region but also the management of expenditure is compliant with the generally accepted principles in budgeting as set by the national government.

For the past three fiscal years, the total revenue is utilized for the following: a) Regular Funds—funds appropriated for the regular operations of the ministries and offices; b) Special Development Funds—funds appropriated for special development projects based on the provision of the BOL; and c) Special Purpose Funds—funds which are appropriated for special programs or expenditures which may be performed or implemented by a ministry or office but are not lodged in their regular funds.

Of the total annual budget, the regular fund allocation can be seen to be on an increasing trend based on the 2020 data. This increase can be attributed to the improvement in the identification of regular functions of the implementing institutions due to the enactment of the BAA 13. On the other hand, the decrease in the Special Purpose Fund (SPF) is due to the minimal expenditures not considered to be part of the regular funds of the ministries and offices; this includes the Miscellaneous Personnel Benefit Fund (MPBF), the contingent fund, and the shares of the LGUs in the taxes, fees, and other charges collected by the national government within BARMM.

The appropriation based on the block grant and other sources commenced in year 2020 as the BTA Parliament enacted its first BAA 03 amounting to sixty-five billion nine hundred sixteen million four hundred sixty-seven thousand, six hundred eighty-six pesos and forty-six centavos (Php65,916,467,686.46) of which there is a 75 percent fund support rate as evidenced by allotment releases to the different ministries and offices.

Moreover, the second General Appropriations Act of the Bangsamoro (GAAB) enacted in 2021 appropriated an amount of seventy-five billion six hundred twenty-eight million six hundred eighty-one thousand seven hundred forty-eight pesos and twenty-six centavos (Php75,628,681,748.26), 84 percent of which were released to ministries and offices for their development interventions. Meanwhile, 52.57 percent or forty-two billion one hundred twenty-nine million two hundred forty-seven thousand three hundred thirty-six pesos and thirty-three centavos (Php42,129,247,336.33) of the appropriated funds were already released to the different ministries and offices as of October 31, 2022.

### Fund Utilization

For FY 2020, the Bangsamoro government incurred a 79.23 percent utilization rate for its BARMM MOA Regular Fund amounting to Php34,212,492,621.85 (Table 5.1). Out of this fund, 67.40 percent or Php13,567,088,578.93 was utilized for Personnel Services (PS), 95.62 percent or Php12,448,656,243.90 for Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE), and 81.69 percent or Php8,196,747,799.02 for the Capital Outlay (CO).

While the region is in its early inception, it is the priority of the Bangsamoro government to track its accomplishments and monitor its spending to ensure that the government interventions are provided in an effective, efficient, and responsive manner. Hence, the BARMM, through the joint effort of the OCM, MFBM, and the BPDA conducted a periodic assessment of the physical and financial performance of the BARMM MOAs.

### Revenue Collection

In 2019, the policy direction which the MFBM-BTO worked on was consistent with the moral governance program of the Chief Minister Ahod B. Ebrahim. Several trainings were conducted or participated by the employees of the MFBM-BTO on matters relating to treasury mechanisms, good practices, and application of moral governance to treasury practices for the purpose of increasing accountability on safe-keeping of BARMM funds. For the last quarter of FY 2019, operations have been stable and local funding requirements of BTA, and BARMM MOAs by virtue of the FY 2019 regional appropriations has been fully served.

The regional collections for FY 2019 amounted to Php394,709,755.62. The target for the period was Php248,615,000.00. Actual regional collection surpassed the target by Php146,094,755.62 or over 59 percent. Moreover, collection increased by 62.05 percent compared to the FY 2018 collection of Php243,568,364.68.

It was crucial for the MFBM-BTO to be prepared to receive the annual block grant starting CY 2020. The office ensured that the Authorized Depository Bank of the Bangsamoro has been opened in early January. The ARMM employees who were extended served as the accountable officers so there have been continuous treasury operations. The MFBM-BTO maintained a single account for all the funds received including local revenue collections. The MFBM-BTO was able to manage and safeguard revenues from the annual block grant, share from the national taxes, regional taxes, fees and charges, special development fund, and other subsidies from national government.

### Local Revenue Collection Performance

In 2019, local revenue collection surpassed the target by 59 percent. This collection is the highest collection reached by the Bangsamoro government. In 2020, even during the pandemic, the local revenue collection surpassed the target by 34 percent. Although the collection was greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the implementation of infrastructure projects and continuing increase in the collection of fees and charges particularly from the Bangsamoro regulatory offices have ensured the achievement of the target. Moreover, the remittance of the proceeds from the PAGIBIG financing of the housing project also contributed to the collection performance.

## Multi-stakeholder Engagement

Pursuant to Section 5 of BAA 06, the Council shall include all provincial governors of Tawi-Tawi, Basilan, Sulu, Maguindanao, and Lanao del Sur and all city mayors of Cotabato, Marawi, and Lamitan of the BARMM.

The participation of LGUs will ensure that the approved development plans of the provinces, cities, municipalities, and barangays are incorporated into the BDP. It also ensures its effectiveness and responsiveness to the needs of the Bangsamoro.

The Bangsamoro Parliament enacted BAA 06, establishing the BEDC, in accordance with the provisions of RA 11054. The act calls for the BEDC to include five Private Sector Representatives (PSRs) as regular members.

Section 5 of the BAA 06 states that the BEDC will select the five PSRs based on the drafted guidelines and qualification criteria developed by the BPDA and approved by the Council to ensure objectivity, integrity, and transparency. It also contains the accreditation and selection procedures, criteria, and the required qualifications of the nominating private sector organizations (PSOs) and PSR nominees. The purpose of the accreditation is to provide eligibility for the PSOs to nominate one of its members as a PSR member of the Council.

Concerning the socioeconomic development of BARMM, the BEDC has accredited CSOs working in BARMM in pursuit of public interests. In 2020, there have been 15 CSOs accredited by the Council, another 13 in 2021, and four in 2022. The first set of PSRs was nominated and accredited on December 29, 2020.

## Bangsamoro Justice System

The BARMM has its own regional judicial system that applies Shari'ah to its constituents. The BOL contains a provision to create a Shari'ah High Court. This Court will consist of five justices including a presiding justice and task to oversee the appellate courts, district courts, and circuit courts.

Aside from the Shari'ah High Court, the Shari'ah Public Assistance Office, and Bangsamoro Integrated Bar shall also be established.

To date, the Shari'ah High Court, Shari'ah Public Assistance Office, and Bangsamoro Integrated Bar are not yet established due to inadequate infrastructure facilities and the need to meet the required competencies and qualifications of Shari'ah Judges and personnel. The requirement for the office structure and personnel component of the Shari'ah High Court is crucial for the establishment of the BJS. The office structure and staffing will be patterned from the Court of Appeals (CA) justices.

In support to this, the Parliament proposed a resolution requesting the Supreme Court of the Philippines to facilitate the immediate organization of the Shari'ah High Court in the BARMM to uphold the spirit of the Shari'ah Justice System in the region.

As of 2019, the Judicial and Bar Council (JBC) has created 48 Shari'ah Circuit Courts (SCC) under the jurisdiction of the Shari'ah District Courts (SDC) in the BARMM. While only 33 of the SCC are organized and 15 are not yet organized located in Tawi-Tawi and Basilan.

It is stated in RA 11054 under section 17 that, "the Parliament shall enact laws to promote and support the traditional or tribal justice systems that are appropriate for the indigenous peoples. The traditional justice systems are the mechanisms to determine, settle, and decide controversies and enforce decisions involving disputes between members of the indigenous peoples concerned in accordance with the customary laws of these communities."

While, Section 20 under the same law provides that the Bangsamoro government shall adopt the principles of conciliation and mediation in settling disputes, with the Parliament enacting the necessary legislation to institute the mechanism for alternative dispute resolution. The Shari'ah courts and traditional or tribal adjudicatory tribunals may utilize this mode of settlement and resolution of cases.

## Development Opportunities

The following are the opportunities significant to the development administration:

**Innovation and technology as tools to facilitate good governance.** The COVID-19 pandemic has made it more difficult for people to physically gather, move around, and go about their everyday lives. Work from home, social distancing policies, and even partial or total lockdowns have been established by numerous governmental and commercial organizations or corporations.

In the area of information and communication technology, rapid advancements are already being made, and they are now widely employed to improve ease and effectiveness in many facets of daily life, including the government. Through innovation and technology, the government was able to sustain its operations by redefining its strategies and making them more creative by conducting meetings and transactions online.

This only proves that the role of technology in governance and the delivery of public services is becoming more crucial. Innovation makes progress inevitable, and technology acts as the driving force behind a government that is capable of operating on a global scale.

Hence, it is worth investing for the Bangsamoro government to take advantage of technological innovations as this help raise performance and productivity. More importantly, it makes a significant contribution to increasing accountability, transparency, information, public participation, and support for best governance practices.

On digital transparency of governance processes and bureaucracy, the launch of digital governance system strengthened through establishment of physical ICT infrastructure and systems will allow for direct and real time e-governance access of LGUs through programs such as DevLIVE+ and Localizing e-Governance for Accelerated Provision of Services (LEAPS) program. Piloted in the areas of Butig and Piagapo in Lanao del Sur with technical support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Bangsamoro team benchmarked the Access to Information (A2i) program of the Government of Bangladesh. The e-governance platform program is aimed at integrating government systems into digital service providers maximizing strong partnership with development partners and institutions.

The LEAPS project will help overcome the dependencies on archaic, paper-based, and manual processes within and among the BARMM LGUs. This project will also maximize the use of MILG's limited manpower and resources to deliver and monitor frontline services effectively and efficiently.

The DevLIVE+ generates socio-demographic profiles, not only at the municipal or barangay level but up to the household level. It also provides disaggregated data by sex, age, work, educational attainment, or spatial location through charts, lists, or even map locations that would facilitate analysis in crafting the local land use and development plans. Considering that significant socioeconomic indicators can be captured related to access to basic services among others, local decision-makers have found the tool essential in resource allocation, prioritization of barangays and delivery of services, or justify their programs, projects, and activities using the DevLIVE+ to improve the conditions of communities who are either most vulnerable, left behind, or lacking in access to government services.

To date, three Digital Service Design Lab (DSDL) workshops have already been conducted; 24 e-Services are simplified for digitalization; 24 Technical Assessment has been conducted for digital center and interactive call center; eight LGUs are already on-board for the DevLIVE+ implementation; two connectivities have already been installed; and one GPS/ICT Equipment have already been procured.

**Strong support and linkages with development partners, national agencies, and other stakeholders.** The Bangsamoro government is already receiving extensive help from development partners, national agencies, and other stakeholders. This support goes beyond local economic growth and development. They also help to address problems and difficulties the administration is facing as BARMM embarks through the extended transition.

An intensified partnership with donors and partners helps the Bangsamoro government achieve its development goal effectively and efficiently.

**3-year extension of the transition.** The BTA will continue to act as the interim administration for the BARMM under the terms of RA 11593, which also extends the transition period from May 2023 to May 2025.

This is an opportunity to review, evaluate, and update the BARMM government's current commitments as reflected in the administration's 12-point priority agenda and the region's 1st BDP in order to make sure that the strategic directions remain pertinent and responsive to the region's long-standing and new development challenges.

**Implementation of Mandanas-Garcia Ruling.** The Mandanas-Garcia Ruling ultimately broadened the national government revenue based on the computation of the annual intergovernmental fiscal transfers of LGUs; before it was estimated only on BIR collections but now it also includes the BOC collections.

## Priority Challenges to be Addressed within 2023-2028

### Bureaucracy

The following are the key challenges of bureaucracy to be addressed in 2023-2028:

**Overlapping and unclear functions in the delivery of services between and among different levels of the government.** Bangsamoro government in its transitional period faces different challenges in addressing the needs of its constituents. The ambiguous delineation of functions among national, regional, and local governments has been realized as one of the root causes of this problem. There are other ministries and offices that have the same beneficiaries for a certain program which resulted in duplication of deliverables due to the unclear distinction of their mandates. There is also an absence of a devolution policy from the national government to BARMM and BARMM to LGUs, and a slow phasing of IGRB concerns due to the multiplicity of priorities of the regional government that affect the full functionalities of other offices both in regional and local level.

**Weak inter-BARMM MOAs/LGUs coordination and linkages.** Lack of policies to enforce a strong link between BARMM MOAs and LGUs to strengthen collaboration in identifying problems and challenges on the ground and harmonizing programs to address the gaps.

Poor coordination among offices leads to poor appreciation of convergence and cooperation among offices' programs, projects, and activities that results in duplicity and unbalanced distribution of focus and prioritization.

**Mechanisms for administration and supervision of local governments not fully streamlined at the local level.** Inadequacy of regional policies in the implementation of transparency and accountability agenda and lack of awareness on existing national government policies are hindering factors to fully localized the programs.

**Intergovernmental relations mechanisms not fully established.** With the passage and ratification of the BOL and the establishment of the BARMM, the national and Bangsamoro governments realized the urgency to create an avenue that will further strengthen the relationship between both governments. Hence, On October 14, 2019, then President Rodrigo Roa Duterte approved the recommendation of the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process (OPAPP) to establish the IGRB through a memorandum issued by the Office of the Executive Secretary.

The IGRB is mandated to coordinate and resolve issues on IGR through regular consultation and continuing negotiations in a non-adversarial manner. It shall exhaust all means to resolve issues brought before it. Unresolved issues shall be elevated to the president, through the Chief Minister of the Bangsamoro government.

As of 2022, only five out of seven IGR mechanisms in the BOL have been operationalized including the Council of Leaders which began convening since January 18, 2021. The PCBPF is yet to be constituted on the side of the Philippine Congress and is to be operationalized while the bill creating the BSDB is pending in the Bangsamoro Parliament.

The national government remains steadfast in its commitment to support the BTA in fulfilling its mandate and functions within the extended transition period to 2025. The testament to this is the various intergovernmental relations bodies, most of which have already been organized. To this end, the creation of the remaining IGR mechanisms needs to be fast-tracked in order to institutionalize all avenues for greater intergovernmental cooperation.

**Nepotism and lack of political will.** One of the contributing factors of poor performance among officials and employees is the practice of nepotism or lack of political will. Those who have strong connections with the influenced individuals are accommodated to the positions regardless of their educational backgrounds, expertise, and experiences. Lack of commitment in the performance of one's duty greatly affects the service delivery to the public. Political dynamics in the process of recruitment is a hindrance in the provision of quality services.

### Development Planning

The following are the key challenges of development planning to be addressed in 2023-2028:

**Weak operationalization of planning and budgeting policies.** The absence of a harmonized regional plan and budget resulted in poor implementation of the PPAs. This poor harmonization can be attributed to limited technical know-how and expertise on planning and budgeting.

**Weak data and communications management.** The manual process and unsystematized data collection and management affects the formulation of development plan. The underlying factors aggravating the weak data and communication management include inadequate regional statistical system, insufficient evidence-based data, absence of development communication plan among BARMM MOAs, weak process of data reconciliation between the national, regional, and local levels, and absence of standardized IEC materials.

Outdated records management systems, inconvenient documents repository otherwise known as records center and regional library are also a challenge given that managing official records is a crucial part in the office operations that involves administrative, financial, and legal. Official public documents such as temporary and permanent in nature are necessary to be properly protected and preserved, as documentary evidence in any official transaction. Record is also a contributory factor to help settle the dispute and a basis of decision-making.

**Poor or non-implementation of some priority PPAs in the development plans.** Political interference and non-provision of standardized transition and strategic plan when leadership change hinders the implementation of the existing development plan to support the continuity of the identified program for implementation.

**Non-institutionalization of Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system.** The unavailability of standardized M&E system in the region prevents the generation of credible information through data collection by actual field monitoring. It is noteworthy that the monitoring activity can check the overall status and condition of the PPAs based on investment program while evaluation determines and measures the progress of its implementation and analyzes the effectivity and efficiency of the program. On the other hand, M&E also help find the emerging gaps and issues that impede its implementation.

It has been observed that slow development of the centralized database management system is driven by delayed provision of policy guidelines on the BARMM standardized M&E system. To expedite the process, while the BARMM M&E system is in the development phase, the adoption of the existing National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Regional Project Monitoring and Evaluation System (RPMES) is recommended to serve as guiding tool in the operationalization of the M&E in the BARMM.

In the development of guidelines on BARMM M&E system's operations manual, a strong support by the BEDC to its adoption and approval is imperative for the full-blown operation of the latter. Dedication and collaborative efforts of the BARMM MOAs and the capacity building that includes orientation, trainings, and benchmarking activities are essential as main catalysts that will greatly contribute to the creation of a functional technical working group in the desk and actual M&E activity.

Nonetheless, there is a need to invite M&E experts, specialists, or consultants from the national government to help develop the human resource capacity of both administrative and technical concerns of the M&E system, given the increasing and multiple development projects being implemented in the BARMM.

### Legislation

The following are the key challenges in terms of legislation to be addressed in 2023-2028:

**Slow enactment of some priority codes and other legislative measures.** The BARMM is currently adopting a parliamentary form of government which necessitates setting up a new bureaucracy under a parliamentary structure. The establishment of a strong organizational structure and necessary systems and processes will ensure the delivery of responsive, effective, and efficient services.

The COVID-19 pandemic has hampered the operations of the Bangsamoro Parliament. At the height of the pandemic, the Bangsamoro Parliament passed a resolution to ensure continuity in the conduct of plenary sessions, consultations, and meetings via teleconferencing. However, activities related to the enactment of priority codes and other legislative measures were still affected.

**Inadequate BTA human and physical resources.** Human and physical resources are vital in the success of one's organization as it serve as the driving factor in fulfilling its mandates. However, the Bangsamoro Parliament has inadequate human and physical resources due to weak implementation of hiring plan and merit-based selection process, political interventions, self-interest of political leaders, and inadequate infrastructure and technological support.

**Inadequate research and development in policy-making.** In policy-making, research and development (R&D) must always be considered due to its significance. The timely enactment of laws and policies is hampered by less prioritization on the importance of R&D and limited staff with competent legislative research skills.

**Inadequate exercise of oversight function.** The role of the oversight function is crucial to good governance and needs to be strengthened through appropriate parliamentary systems and procedures. With this, the Bangsamoro Parliament can ensure a balance of power and assert its role as the defender of people's interests. The Members of the Parliament (MPs) hold annual technical budget hearings in every ministry to ensure financial accountability. After the ministries' budget has been passed, the Bangsamoro Parliament has an important role to play in monitoring how the budget funds are spent. However, the Bangsamoro Parliament has an inadequate exercise of its oversight function because there is a lack of monitoring mechanism as to how the budget is being utilized.

**Slow Committee process.** Committees are the principal forum for the discussion and deliberation of policies and conduct of oversight activities. Having a strong committee system is an important determinant of the effectiveness of a Bangsamoro Parliament in implementing its powers. In order for the MPs to effectively perform their duties, the Bangsamoro Parliament must be able to provide them with support and information they need. However, slow committee processes occur due to weak implementation of committee system, limited technical expertise, competing schedules for the conduct of committee activities and public consultations on policy, and absence of internal rules and regulations for some committees.

### Fiscal Management

The following are the key challenges of fiscal management to be addressed in 2023-2028:

As it envisions a strong foundation of inclusive, transparent, accountable, and efficient governance founded on the idealism of moral governance, the BARMM takes on the responsibility to promote honest, efficient, and responsible fiscal management and fund utilization. While in a transition period, the government herald towards strengthening the foundations of sound fiscal policies, responsive budget process, and accountable safekeeping of Bangsamoro resources.

For its first three years of operations, the Bangsamoro government, through its interim ministries committed to fortify the standards and policies which are carefully and judiciously crafted in the context of Bangsamoro experience. The extension of the transition period is seen to be an opportunity for the BARMM to set a clear path and steer the government towards recovery and sustainability for the years to come.

Amidst these initiatives, the government still acknowledges its rudimentary experience in public financial management. For the past two fiscal years, the executive part of the government has experienced the challenge of achieving and maintaining satisfactory budget utilization rates. This may be primarily attributed to the continuing study to improve the efficient strategies in expenditure management. This core problem is brought about by some essential factors such as planning, implementation mechanisms, and procedures involved in fiscal management.

**Limited technical know-how in program budgeting.** One of the seen challenges in the implementation and fund utilization for the first three years of BARMM operation is the limited technical know-how in program budgeting. The BARMM adopts the national policy of cash-based budgeting, limiting the coverage of obligation to one fiscal year only, which enjoins government institutions to be more proactive in their expenditures through optimized planning and ensuring of implementation readiness of programs and projects. Understandably, the BARMM MOAs are only starting to build the foundation of its respective organization. Nevertheless, impactful results and service delivery may only be achieved through improvement in the efficiency in program budgeting.

**Manual budget processing.** Due to the advancement of technology, manual budget processing has been a problem in different organizations nowadays. Limited IT infrastructure, no new government accounting system (e-NGAs), budget and treasury management system (BTMS), unified reporting system (URS), and lack of IT experts on automated budget processing are some of its roots.

There is yet an established system for government accounting or cash management which may have some effect in the delayed implementation of programs and projects. This problem, however, is multi-faceted as it can be attributed to the lack of an efficient IT infrastructure, low connectivity, and expertise in terms of system development. Most notably, the lack of catch-up plan and insufficient capacity of program implementers in the face of natural and man-made calamities contribute greatly to the low absorptive capacity and flexibility of the implementing BARMM MOAs.

**Lack of fiscal and monetary policy.** Policies are relevant to organizations as it guides its operation. However, lack of fiscal and monetary policy has been a problem in the region as up until now there is no revenue and investment code, this might be due to lack of expert adept at BARMM context, lack of prioritization, and lack of an appropriate mechanism that would enable LGUs to generate locally sourced revenue.

Lack of expertise and awareness of Islamic finance is also a factor that can be attributed to the lack of intervention to promote financial literacy (on financial and monetary policies), poor information dissemination on financial literacy and inclusion, and less local public investment.

**Fluctuating rates in local revenue generation.** Although the collections for regional fees and charges have continuously increased in 2021, the collection in regional wealth tax and contractors has decreased, thus making the collection performance short by five percent. The restrictions from the COVID-19 pandemic affected the procurement of infrastructure projects, thus, what was disbursed during the year was mainly from the mobilization fees and some contracts have not been awarded. Thus, the collection of contractors' taxes was not maximized. The collection of regional wealth tax on the other hand is dependent on the production of mines. This type of collection is not stable due to the varying amount of mining production.

**Weak planning, programming, and budgeting linkages.** There is seemingly fragmented planning, programming, and budgeting linkages. This is manifested through the lack of mechanisms like a joint committee or body composed of the planning and financial offices, absence of long-term strategic plans, and limited convergence interventions. This is further weakened by the fast turnover of employees and slow hiring process. Another is the limited technical budgeting capacity due to changes in financial practitioners.

**Delayed implementation of PPAs.** There are several factors that hinder the timely implementation of PPAs which include unpreparedness for internal and external adversities due to lack of catch-up plan, overlapping of implementation schedule of several PPAs, limited technical capacity on program implementation, inadequate staffing and weak structure, and slow hiring process.

Improving the cash management is another concern caused by lack of an automatic reversion system (treasury). The MDS used by the national government in disbursement of funds is a good government practice that is yet to be exercised in the BARMM. Moreover, exploratory talks have been kickstarted with the government servicing bank which is aimed at improving the cash management of the region.

Lastly, the delayed submission of reportorial documents also contributes to the disparity in actual expenditure and monitoring records. The regional government is expected to consolidate reportorial requirements to streamline financial data needed for the presentation of a credible financial position.

### Multi-stakeholder Engagement

The following are the key challenges of multi-stakeholder engagement to be addressed in 2023-2028:

**Differences in approaches and strategies in governance of the political leaders.** There have been these differences in approaches and strategies in governance of leaders because of their differences in political creed and affiliation.

**Poor inclusivity and access to information.** It is being observed that the whole-of-society approach is not adopted due to lack of policy on Rules of Engagement and non-recognition of the expertise of non-state actors. There is also limited public access to information on government processes due to poor implementation of freedom of information (FOI).

### Bangsamoro Justice System

Strengthening the multi-justice system in the BARMM is crucial to ensure inclusive coverage among the diverse communities in the region. The BARMM is composed of a culturally diverse population which requires the Bangsamoro government to implement an inclusive justice system.

Under RA 11054, "The Parliament shall adopt measures to ensure mutual respect and protection of the distinct beliefs, customs, and traditions of the Bangsamoro people and the other inhabitants in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region." The BOL guarantees the protection of the rights of the people in the region.

The following are the key challenges of the BJS to be addressed in 2023-2028:

**BJS not fully implemented in the BARMM.** As provided in Article X of the BOL, the BJS shall be administered in accordance with the unique cultural and historical heritage of the Bangsamoro and shall be in consonance with the Constitution, Shari'ah, traditional or tribal laws, and other relevant laws. The Bangsamoro government is yet to establish and operationalize the BJS structure in the region.

**Lack of Shari'ah judges and personnel for Shari'ah courts.** In 2019, the JBC has created 48 SCC under the jurisdiction of the SDC in the BARMM. While only 33 of the SCC are organized, and 15 are not yet organized which are situated in Tawi-Tawi and Basilan provinces. There is a necessity of establishing additional Shari'ah courts within and outside the region. During the BJS subsector consultation, it was mentioned that the reason why the Supreme Court did not establish additional Shari'ah courts is because of the lesser statistics of cases recorded. Another factor contributing to the lack of Shari'ah judges and personnel for Shari'ah Courts is the inorganization of the Integrated Shari'ah Bar of the Philippines.

**Less prioritization on Shari'ah capacity development.** There is less priority on capacity development on Shari'ah resulting to lesser number of capacitated Shari'ah practitioners. Also, the lack of training hampered the gradual appointment of qualified Shari'ah judges.

Presently, the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF) is the only recognized institution by the Supreme Court of the Philippines to facilitate training on Shari'ah subjects which is included in the requirements for taking the Special Shari'ah Bar Examination. However, the NCMF training is very limited in the number of slots for their accommodation. Meanwhile, being a college graduate with a bachelor's degree in Shari'ah is not sufficient for taking the special bar examination as they also need to undergo training from the NCMF to secure a certificate from the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court through the Office of the Bar Confidant conducts the Special Shari'ah Bar Examination only once every two years upon the request of the Secretary/ Chief Executive Officer of the NCMF.

As a result, there is inadequate pool of highly specialized and qualified Shari'ah practitioners in the BARMM to fill in the vacant plantilla positions in the Shari'ah courts.

**Slow implementation of BOL provision on BJS.** Reiterated in Title V, Section 12B of the BAA 13, Shari'ah Public Assistance Office will be headed by a director assisted by two counselors who are members of the Philippine Shari'ah Bar and they shall be assisted by an immediate staff. The director and two Shari'ah counselors shall be appointed by the Chief Minister. The Shari'ah Public Assistance Office is mandated to provide free legal assistance to poor or indigent party litigants.

Currently, the Shari'ah Public Assistance Office has not been fully established and operationalized. No resolutions to facilitate the immediate organization of the office that would primarily provide free legal assistance to indigent party litigants; prepare and file petitions, complaints, and/or responsive pleadings, and represent indigent defendants in ordinary civil actions, special civil actions, special proceedings and in any stage criminal proceedings before the Shari'ah Courts.

The same applied to the Office for Traditional Justice System. As per Section 27, D of the BAA 13, the Office for Traditional Justice system will be the primary responsible for overseeing the study, preservation, and development of traditional or tribal justice systems within the BARMM and it shall be attached to the OCM. Up to this date, these offices have not yet been brought before the Bangsamoro Parliament.

Full implementation of these laws will significantly increase access to the justice system and swift resolution of disputes, especially among the poor and marginalized groups. In return, it will increase the trust and confidence of the public. Greater access to justice comes with immense benefits for societies, including improving social cohesion and people's well-being.

**Absence of BTA Legislation on the implementation of the Bangsamoro Justice System.** The absence of policy issuance or support for the complementation of the multi-judicial system of the Bangsamoro may cause confusion to the people in determining the applicable laws to their concerns, given the multi-racial occurrence in the BARMM.

The multi-judicial system in the Bangsamoro is composed of the Shari'ah, Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), Customary Laws, Tribal, and Regular Courts. The inadequacy in the awareness of this multi-judicial system leads to a very low public trust in the justice system that may cause community disorder and conflicts. Poor people tend to put the law into their own hands and refuse to elevate the case to the proper court.

In the case of ADR, there are no funds allocated for the Council of Elders to motivate them in resolving disputes. As a result, they are not interested in the arising altercations in their surroundings which lead to serious conflicts. Moreover, the Council of Elders is not properly identified to preserve their status in their community.

**Weak coordination among the five pillars of the justice system: Law enforcement, prosecution, courts, correction, community.** The BARMM needs a strengthened five pillars of the Criminal Justice System (CJS) for a just, inclusive, and accessible Philippine judicial system. The Criminal Justice System (CJS) shall consist of a series of actions, tasks, or activities that will constitute the formal response to perceived law-and-order issues: crime prevention and reduction; the arrest and prosecution of suspects; and the hearing of criminal cases by the courts.

According to the assessment of PDP 2023-2028, despite the positive developments, there are still lacking in the policy reforms and key legislations. The CJS in the Philippines is composed of five pillars - law enforcement, prosecution, the courts, correction, and the community. It was found out in the PDP that the fragmentation of the CJS remains a challenge; backlogs in resolving cases, delays caused by inefficient practices, and aging persist; limited resources weaken the justice sector; and low public confidence in the justice system undermines the rule of law. Also, there is a possibility of undue administration of justice such as the absence of preliminary investigation, untimely or no delivery of subpoena, no arraignment, and other due processes.

These problems mainly affect the implementation of programs and strengthening coordination. In the BARMM, the surging number of crimes keep on flashing on the news, but the authorities would only say that the proper investigation will be done. What the people want to see is minimal crime incidence. The prompt action of the authorities in the repression of criminals must be strengthened. The coordination among pillars of the justice system shall be strengthened to oversee the implementation of strict monitoring of the progress of the cases and imposing penalties on erring lawyers.

The court pillar plays a major role in the resolution of cases. They shall carefully evaluate the information and pieces of evidence before pursuing a hearing and rendering a final judgment. In this pillar, the number of cases also affects the functions of the judges such as the speedy trial. This requires sufficient facilities and an increased number of judges to facilitate the adjudication of cases. Furthermore, the court shall strengthen its coordination among other pillars for the proper administration of justice.

The necessity of strengthening the administration of justice to prevent injustices in the future is also crucial. There are cases that reached the Supreme Court petitioning for the grave abuse of discretion of the judges. Hence, a policy strengthening the coordination and monitoring mechanism for the administration of justice is indispensable.

The first to uphold the law is the law enforcement pillar. It represents public authority and is in charge of preserving public safety and order. This pillar must remain strong in order for the populace to be responsive and involved in achieving due process. The BARMM is responsible for closely monitoring law enforcement activities and enforcing sanctions for improper use of force.

There is a real pushback in the correction pillar. The rampant crimes in the BARMM could be an implication of the failure of reformation and rehabilitation of the offenders. The Bangsamoro government shall provide support to the programs and projects for reformation and rehabilitation in preventing recidivism cases. Additionally, those found guilty of ta'azir charges, which are minor infractions punishable by Shari'ah courts, must be imprisoned in separate institutions while serving their terms in order to avoid further influence from those with major offenses and to ensure their prompt reformation.

The LGUs as part of the community pillar plays a major role in the development of the justice system in the Bangsamoro. The MILG-BARMM as its counterpart is mandated to promote peace and order, ensure public safety, and further strengthen local government capability aimed toward the effective delivery of basic services to the citizenry. Through LGUs, the Bangsamoro government can contribute to easy access of the poor or vulnerable groups to justice.

Also, poor litigants' access to available legal services may be hampered by a lack of awareness on their part. The costs incurred during hearings and other legal proceedings are another common factor that contributes to injustices.

Furthermore, there should be a mechanism for inter-agency dialogue and coordinated implementation of reforms in the justice system.

## Priority Policy and Legislative Agenda

**Bangsamoro Revenue Code.** This shall cover taxing powers of the Bangsamoro Government, in accordance with the Constitution and the BOL.

**Bangsamoro Investment Code.** This shall cover the matters relating to investments and incentives regulations that will be applied in the Bangsamoro Region.

**Bangsamoro Budget System Act.** This shall provide for the creation of the Bangsamoro Budget Office (BBO) under the control and supervision of the MFBM, and is primarily mandated to promote the sound, efficient, and effective management, and utilization of all resources of the Bangsamoro Government.

**Bangsamoro Islamic Banking and Finance.** This covers matters pertaining to legal and regulatory framework for Islamic Banking and Finance in Bangsamoro, recognizes the vital role of Islamic banking and finance in creating opportunities for greater financial inclusion, and discusses this system of finance based on Islamic law.

**Bangsamoro Local Governance Code.** This shall provide for a more responsive and accountable local government structure instituted through a system of decentralization whereby constituent local government units shall be given more powers, authority, responsibilities, and resources in a gradual and systematic approach.

This policy agenda intends to support sub-sector objectives on strengthening the delivery of public service; and strengthening and enhancing local government administration and supervision; as well as in achieving the ideal functionality and performance of LGUs.

**Bangsamoro Electoral Code.** This code is proposed to be promulgated to prescribe the structural, functional, and procedural principles in the elections of officers within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, and secure honest, credible, just, and free elections thereby allowing democratic political participation and reflecting the genuine will of the electorate.

**Enactment of Bangsamoro Code of Muslim Personal Laws.** This priority legislative agenda tends to enforce and harmonize the application of laws in all Shari'ah Courts in the Philippines. This will pave way in establishing and operationalizing the structures of BJS in the BARMM and will set in motion an institutionalized coordination mechanism between the Supreme Court of the Philippines and the Bangsamoro government.

Presidential Decree 1083 provides for the general enactment on Administration of Muslim Personal Laws. The Code of Muslim Personal Laws (CMPL) refers to the law that governs the family and personal relations of the Muslim Filipinos. This decree recognizes the legal system of Muslims in the Philippines as part of the law of the land, codifies Muslim personal laws, and provides for the administration and enforcement of the Code through the establishment of Shari'ah courts.

**Codification of ADR mechanisms in resolving tribal disputes.** The Codification of the ADR will pave way to the use of the alternative dispute system as well as the establishment or appointment of focal office to implement the ADR. ADR has emerged as the key to decongesting court dockets. It's a process or procedure used to resolve a dispute or controversy, other than by adjudication of a presiding judge of a court or an officer of a government agency in which a neutral third party participates to assist in the resolution of issues. There are three types of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms: conciliation, mediation, and arbitration incorporating provisions that will strengthen the partnership among BARMM MOAs and other non-state actors.

**An enabling law for open governance.** Inspired by the Open Government Partnership initiative, the concept of Bangsamoro open governance is committed to the principles of inclusive participation, promoting transparency, fighting corruption, empowering the Bangsamoro people and leveraging on technology to strengthen local moral governance. The values of transparency and open government is crucial to make government information more accessible and available through the use of technology to ensure accountability.

This policy agenda intends to support the sub-sector objective of strengthening transparency and accountability mechanisms for a more inclusive and open participation in governmental processes.

Fiscal openness will provide the platform to inform the Bangsamoro people and local and international partners on regional and local governance, maximize engagement and establish citizen feedback mechanisms to help fight corruption.

**Strengthen the standardization of monitoring and evaluation mechanism of the Bangsamoro Government and Local Development Council of BARMM LGUs.** The standardized M&E mechanism shall provide a scheme for the Bangsamoro government and Local Development Council in monitoring and evaluation of development programs or projects in the BARMM.

**Bangsamoro Government Communications Policy.** This encompasses the central objectives and principles for the Bangsamoro government's communication with its constituents, civil society organizations, academe, businesses, and other stakeholders. The principles of the policy will serve as the basis for all the BARMM MOAs on how communication will operate within government departments and across the regional government, mainland, and island provinces.

This policy agenda intends to support the sub-sectoral objective of strengthening data and communications management. Moreover, it shall serve as a framework in the development of communication plans and strategies for the government.

**Creation of Bangsamoro Human Settlements Adjudication Commission.** The Commission shall assume and continue to perform the adjudication functions of the former HLURB-ARMM, now Ministry of Human Settlements and Development (MHSD) - BARMM, and shall be attached to the Ministry for policy, planning and program coordination only. In the performance of its functions, the Commission shall be guided by the Constitutional provision that affords all persons the right to a speedy disposition of their cases before all judicial, quasi-judicial or administrative bodies. Toward this end, the independence of the adjudication process and the speedy resolution of disputes involving housing and real estate development and transactions, land use, and HOAs within BARMM jurisdiction shall be ensured, and all parties to these controversies shall be accorded equal access to legal processes.
