# Chapter 4: Bangsamoro Development Framework 2023-2028

This chapter consists of three sections. The first section presents the Bangsamoro Development Framework, covering the full hierarchy of results and the corresponding strategies. The second section covers the macroeconomic targets, justifications, and key assumptions. The third section discusses how the 2nd BDP satisfies a crucial planning standard - vertical and horizontal alignment.

## Bangsamoro Development Framework 2023-2028

### Vision

Consistent with the national direction, the Plan's sectoral framework is based on the national framework, but with a focus on regional strategies. It also emphasizes the regional vision: "A Bangsamoro that is united, enlightened, self-governing, peaceful, just, morally upright, and progressive."

The Bangsamoro government also envisions a territory devoid of all types of conflict - one that is permanently peaceful and where residents enjoy a sense of security and comfort as well as just, morally upright, and forward-thinking leadership.

Aside from the fact that a vision is typically long-term in character, key elements such as peace, unity, and justice continue to be relevant as a desired state by the end of 2028.

### Mission

In support to the realization of the vision, the Bangsamoro government is determined to accomplish this mission:

"Guided by moral governance and in pursuit of genuine and meaningful autonomy, the Bangsamoro government ensures the necessary conditions for enduring peace and sustained socioeconomic development suitable to the systems of life, needs, and aspirations of its people by providing services to communities, ensuring multi-stakeholder participation, and facilitating appropriate partnership."

Principles of moral governance and genuine and meaningful autonomy remain central for the Bangsamoro government in achieving the twin goals of lasting peace and sustainable socioeconomic development in the region. Further, the value of inclusion through multi-stakeholder participation and effective governance through services to communities remain to be salient features of the Bangsamoro leadership.

### Overall Goal

The framework of this plan is intended to help the Bangsamoro government in taking a systematic approach to help identify, quantify, and justify the strategies that will help attain the objectives of the region.

The overall goal is to have an empowered, cohesive, and progressive Bangsamoro. "Empowered" refers to the improved capacity of the communities as a byproduct of improved access to quality basic social services and widening of economic opportunities, which are caused by a remarkable growth in institution building and service delivery. "Cohesive" aims to have improved relationships between and among the stakeholders in the Bangsamoro as evidenced in reduced incidence of violent conflict and forged partnerships in governance or in broader development work, while "Progressive" aims to attain a sustained ability of the Bangsamoro region to optimize existing and potential resources in addressing the development needs of the communities and in realizing the economic and the human potential of the region.

### Development Goals

The 2nd BDP consists of six (6) development goals, as follows:

**Goal 1: Stable, just, and accountable government**

Development administration assumes a level of stability in the face of external and internal shocks, ensuring continuity of service delivery. It reflects the ability of ministries, government offices, and authorities to carry out their duties effectively and efficiently, even during emergencies and political events such as elections or any changes in power.

A just government means that the government is the primary agent of economic and social justice. It also means that the government will exercise all powers prudently to advance the public interest and the leaders use their powers to ensure inclusive and pervasive growth.

On the other hand, accountable government means that institutions, leaders, and staff are held accountable for the use of government resources and powers. It also means having accountability frameworks, mechanisms, systems, and processes in place to recognize and reward good performance, learn lessons, and avoid or stop bad practices.

**Goal 2: Equitable, competitive, and robust economy**

An equitable economy implies that economic gains are benefitted by all with special consideration for the poor and marginalized. It also implies that remarkable improvements in key inequality indicators such as Gini coefficient, poverty gap, and poverty severity have been observed.

Competitive economy implies that the BARMM economy enjoys comparative and competitive advantage in selected commodities, and these advantages have been optimized through improved local and international market linkages. It also implies the use of technology by key players in the development and promotion of local products. At the macroeconomic level, this implies a sustained double-digit growth in GDP, and that industry and services sectors account a significant share in the overall economy.

Robust economy implies that the Bangsamoro economy exemplifies a sustained growth over the next six years. It also means that the Bangsamoro government's goal and supporting policies strive to diversify and stabilize the economy to increase the number of quality job opportunities and improve access to goods and services.

**Goal 3: Peaceful, safe, and resilient Bangsamoro communities**

The Bangsamoro aims to achieve lasting peace through ensuring security and intensifying peace-building efforts. It also aims to have a safe community for the Bangsamoro by protecting the Bangsamoro people as well as creating communities that able to withstand natural calamities and human-induced disasters.

**Goal 4: Inclusive, responsive, and quality social services**

The Bangsamoro government aims to have quality social services that are inclusive of all sectors regardless of colors, tribes, and political affiliations to ensure that it will leave no one behind. The Bangsamoro government also ensures that services respond to the needs of the people of all kinds and the Bangsamoro as a whole.

**Goal 5: Rich and diverse Bangsamoro culture and identity preserved and recognized**

The Bangsamoro should exercise its powers and authority to maintain and promote its rich, diverse culture and identity. Its recognition and promotion are mandated under the Sec. 24, Art. IX of the BOL as it is the primary cause of the Bangsamoro struggle.

**Goal 6: Strategic, adequate, and climate-resilient infrastructure**

Strategic refers to the type of infrastructure that has broad-based and inclusive effects to the industries and communities. Adequate refers on the ability to meet infrastructure demands of the industries and communities, and climate-resilient refers to the type of infrastructure that can withstand calamities induced by climate change.

### Development Strategies

Development strategies are identified to ensure that development initiatives in the BARMM are geared towards the attainment of the higher-level development goals, thereby contributing to the national priorities.

1. Improve and strengthen governance mechanisms for a stable, just, and accountable Bangsamoro government;
2. Create an enabling environment towards an equitable, competitive, and robust economy;
3. Harness technology and innovations to increase socioeconomic opportunities and improve government services;
4. Improve ecological integrity, resilience of communities, and ensure a healthy and clean environment;
5. Enhance and strengthen the peace, public order, safety, and security and uphold human rights for inclusive, peaceful, progressive, and sustainable development;
6. Ensure inclusive and equitable access to quality services for social justice and human capital development;
7. Mainstream Bangsamoro cultural diversity, beliefs, heritage, and identity; and
8. Scale-up functional, strategic, climate-resilient, and quality infrastructure to support sustainable socioeconomic development in the Bangsamoro.

## Pillars of Moral Governance

Moral Governance is at the centerpiece of BARMM's leadership and governance for 2023-2028. This core value is exemplified in the principles of the following:

1. **Integrity.** In order to avoid being influenced in the execution of their official duties, those in positions of public trust should not bind themselves in any manner, whether financially or otherwise.

2. **Accountability.** Public office holders should be as open and transparent about all decisions and actions they take. They should document their decisions and limit information only when the larger public interest clearly requires it. Public servants must answer to the people and the authority.

3. **Transparency and honesty.** Holders of public offices must declare any private interests related to their public duties and take steps to resolve any conflicts that arise in a way that protects the public interest. All public transactions should be made public.

4. **Sense of patriotism.** Government officials should invest heavily in their way of life, achievements, rich history, and love for country. Also, the reputation and integrity of the place must be maintained and protected.

5. **Striving for excellence.** To achieve excellence, we must uphold the legitimacy of all our actions. The community will benefit whether public servants consider the credibility and transparency of their work. They should strive to deliver the highest quality in everything they do, prioritizing process over results for the good of all.

6. **Cultural understanding and tolerance.** Public officials should gain a better understanding and awareness on the socioeconomics and differences between societies. They should invest heavily in how they are important for these specific provincial elements, adding variety to the entire Bangsamoro.

7. **Unwavering loyalty to God.** Unwavering devotion to God is one characteristic of an effective public servant. As a result, public officials designated as leaders are required to strictly follow the rules and regulations set by authorities.

8. **Justice.** A public servant should serve the public without prejudice. Equity should triumph without regard for oneself, family and members, companions, or social and political alliances.

9. **Inclusivity.** A good public servant fosters an inclusive environment that makes communities more welcoming and freer from discrimination based on religion, ethnicity, or culture. They appreciate the region's identity-building and cultural characteristics.

10. **Objectivity.** Holders of public office should make only merit-based decisions when conducting public business, such as making public appointments, awarding contracts, or recommending individuals for rewards and benefits. Public officials should decide solely in the public interest. They should do nothing to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their families, and others.

11. **Dialogue and meaningful engagement.** Public servants should ask the opinion of the community by making dialogue with them to specify what needs to be addressed and to get meaningful engagement and positive change to benefit both parties.

12. **Balance between practical life and the moral side.** In carrying out government duties, public servants must balance the practical and the moral or ethical values. They must not deviate from the moral aspect of carrying out their duties and responsibilities, especially in the public's interest.

## Macroeconomic Targets

Based on the assessment of the macroeconomic performance of the BARMM in 2020-2022, the following are the macroeconomic targets for 2023-2028:

### Table 4.1 BARMM Macroeconomic Targets, 2023-2028

| MACROECONOMIC INDICES | BASELINE | END-OF-PLAN TARGET | SOURCE |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| GRDP Annual Average Growth Rate | 7.5 percent (2020-2021) | 8 percent-9 percent for six years | PSA Report |
| GRDP Per Capita - Annual Average Growth Rate | 6.4 percent (2020-2021) | 6 percent-9 percent | PSA Report |
| Annual double-digit real growth of Industry and Services Sectors | Industry - 7.9 percent, Services - 6.6 percent (2020-2021) | 10 percent-12 percent | PSA Report |
| Gross Capital Formation (GCF) as Percentage of GRDE/GRDP | 16.91 percent (2021) | Upward trend - 18 percent-20 percent share of GCF to GRDE/GRDP | PSA Report |
| Inflation Rate | 2.40 percent (2021) | 2 percent - 4 percent | PSA Report |
| Unemployment Rate | 3.80 percent (2021) | 3 percent - 5 percent | PSA Report |
| Underemployment Rate | 9.0 percent (2020) | 4 percent - 7 percent | PSA Report |
| Poverty Incidence | 29.80 percent (2021) | 20 percent - 25 percent | PSA Report |

### Target 1: Sustain an annual average growth rate of 8.0 percent to 9.0 percent for six years

The primary target is to have a sustained growth rather than one-time growth and using an annual average growth rate allows an economy to recover from an internal or external shock. As the region with the lowest economic performance at 1.4 percent share of overall economic growth, it cannot achieve the same level of growth as the national average. The growth rate must be higher to be able to catch up with other regions.

One of the assumptions is that there will be no sustained large-scale war in the next six years. Significant headways in the peace process and a sharp decline in incidents of violent conflict will bolster investor confidence, leading to fresh investments in the BARMM. The region will recover from the ill-effects of the pandemic and there will be no large-scale external shock that will require long term lockdowns and economic restrictions. With most sectors and industries still in their infancy, government expenditure is expected to "pump-prime" the economy. In addition, there are no large-scale internal and external shocks that could potentially wipe out initial economic gains with the scale of a pandemic.

### Target 2: GRDP per capita will have an annual average growth rate of 6 percent to 9 percent within six-years

The economic growth rate will largely outpace the population growth rate. GRDP per capita is a good complement to GRDP as it reflects distribution.

There will be a sustained economic growth rate within the range of 8.0 percent to 9.0 percent and annual population growth will be between 2.0 percent to 4.0 percent for the next six years.

### Target 3: Services and industry sectors to register a sustained double-digit real growth, ranging from 10 percent to 12 percent

Growth in the services and industry sectors is instrumental to inclusive and broad-based growth, as these are the sectors that generate jobs, create wealth, and have greater resiliency at the time of natural calamities such as unfavorable weather conditions. AFF remains BARMM's strongest economic sector, but it needs to be complemented with growth in industry and services to create a more balanced, resilient, and equitable economy. A large portion of the new investments coming into the region as BARMM opens its economy will be in the industry and services sectors. Construction, mining and quarrying, wholesale and retail trade, real estate and ownership of dwellings, accommodation, and food service activities are among the sub-sectors that are expected to be bullish that will generate more jobs.

### Target 4: An upward trend in capital formation in the next six years is anticipated as BARMM registers greater stability and predictability in terms of investment climate. By the end of 2028, Gross Capital Formation should account for 18 percent to 20 percent of GRDE or GRDP.

It is capital formation that will cause long-term and sustainable growth in the region. However, it is highly sensitive to the political and social realities in the region. The passage of priority codes, particularly the Investment Code, will put in place a set of rules and procedures - creating a healthy, stable, and predictable investment climate.

Assumptions include priority codes and other important bills that will be enacted during the extension period; and political events (or changes in power) will not cause or lead to overall regional instability.

### Target 5: Inflation rate maintained at 2.0 percent to 4.0 percent

An inflation rate beyond 4.0 percent will already have repercussions on food items and basic necessities. This target can be achieved by improved competition in markets, a reliable supply chain, and improved connectivity between and across markets as a result of large-scale investments in infrastructure.

Among the assumptions are the national government's investments in large-scale public infrastructure in the region, such as airports, ports, national roads, bridges, and telecommunications that will facilitate trade, improve competition, and reduce operational costs; and BARMM and the LGUs will complement this by investing in local roads, public terminals, and other public infrastructures.

### Target 6: Unemployment rate at 3.0 percent to 5.0 percent; and underemployment rate at 4.0 percent to 7.0 percent

An increasing number of investments and the assistance of the development partners in the region that contributes to the economic performance and development will result to a lower unemployment rate.

Underemployment is a more critical feature in BARMM as a large portion of the population depends on AFF for food and income. With services and industry registering significant shares to overall economic performance, underemployment is likely to be reduced and maintained within 4.0 percent to 7.0 percent since underemployment is more of a rural phenomenon.

Services and industry sectors will have a steady growth in the next 3-6 years, reducing the vulnerability of a significant percentage of the labor force to underemployment issues.

### Target 7: Poverty incidence at 20 percent to 25 percent; poverty gap at downward trend, and poverty severity at downward trend

Given the significant reduction in poverty incidence in 2021, the Bangsamoro government can sustain a double-digit drop in poverty incidence of the region. The target is to reduce poverty incidence to a range of 20 percent to 25 percent with poverty gap and poverty severity on a downward trend.

The poverty gap and poverty severity are critical indicators for BARMM as these reflect distribution issues. The poverty gap is critical because it reflects the depth of poverty, while the poverty severity is equally critical because it reflects inequality between and among the poor. Conflict in BARMM is an injustice issue, and inequality between and among the poor is a strong manifestation of economic injustice.

Social protection programs will continue and will be further strengthened through better systems at the regional and local levels. These programs are vital and, in fact, serve as lifelines during emergencies.

## Ensuring Horizontal Alignment

When it comes to horizontal alignment, the Bangsamoro government also ensures that the 2nd BDP is aligned with the Enhanced 12-Point Priority Agenda of the BARMM.

The BDIP translates the 2nd BDP's development thrusts and priorities into concrete programs and projects. The AIP shall be prepared to serve as basis in the preparation of the budget proposals of BARMM MOAs for possible funding through the GAAB.

---

## Ensuring Vertical Alignment

The Bangsamoro government ensures that the strategies were vertically linked to the Mindanao development plans, the 8-Point Socioeconomic Agenda of the Marcos Administration, PDP 2023-2028, Ambisyon Natin 2040, and SDGs.

### Alignment to the Mindanao Development Agenda

The Bangsamoro government ensures that its development strategies were in line with the development agenda of Mindanao in order to create economic opportunities, integration, and growth throughout the entire Mindanao. Through this strategy, the BARMM will be part of future development initiatives in Mindanao as well as in the BIMP-EAGA.

### Alignment to the 8-Point Socioeconomic Agenda of the Marcos Administration

The 2nd BDP is bolstered, outlining its strategies to contribute to the Marcos administration's 8-point socioeconomic strategy to intensify efforts to mitigate the effects of inflation through its overarching objective of reviving job growth and reducing poverty by guiding the economy back to its high-growth course and, more significantly, via economic reform for a wealthy, inclusive, and resilient society.

The 8-Point Socioeconomic Agenda is strategically focused on several economic issues, including minimizing socioeconomic scarring, reducing transportation and logistics costs, enhancing social protections, ensuring sound macroeconomic fundamentals by improving bureaucratic efficiency, increasing employability to create more jobs, improving infrastructure, achieving energy security, and encouraging research, development, and innovation.

In a similar vein, the 2nd BDP's overarching goal is to create an empowered, cohesive, and progressive Bangsamoro. The plan has identified development strategies that will ensure that activities in the BARMM are directed toward achieving higher-level development goals and also supporting national priorities.

### Alignment to the PDP 2023-2028

In achieving the nation's development agenda, the Bangsamoro government collaborates with the national government. The 2nd BDP is a six-year plan that follows the national planning period.

The Bangsamoro government guaranteed that the 2nd BDP is in conformity with the PDP 2023-2028, which is focused on achieving economic transformation for prosperity, inclusivity, and resilience. It is also aligned and supporting the realization of the Ambisyon Natin 2040.

### Alignment to the SDGs

The SDGs provide a practical framework for pinpointing the region's potential contributions and developing a focused action plan for development strategy.

Linking regional development initiatives with the SDGs would significantly contribute in building a better world while addressing the development risks and concerns in the region. The Bangsamoro government could then direct its programs and projects on the pertinent problems, transforming challenges brought on by resource scarcity, population growth, poverty, and environmental issues into real opportunities.

### Table 4.2 Alignment of the 2nd BDP 2023-2028 to the Mindanao Development Agenda, 8-Point Socioeconomic Agenda of the Marcos Administration, PDP 2023-2028, and SDG
