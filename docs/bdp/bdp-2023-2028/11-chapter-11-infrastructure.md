# Chapter 11: Scaling up strategic, adequate, and climate-resilient infrastructure to support sustainable socioeconomic development in the Bangsamoro

Articles XII and XIII of the BOL provide and delineate the authority and duties between the national government and the Bangsamoro government concerning public works, utilities, and infrastructure in the BARMM.

This chapter covers five sub-sectors of the infrastructure development sector, namely: transport, water resources, energy, ICT, and socioeconomic infrastructure. The transport sub-sector covers roads and bridges, airports, and seaports. Water resources cover potable and safe drinking water facilities, irrigation systems, flood control, and drainage facilities. Energy covers the power industry, oil, and gas. ICT infrastructure covers data center, fiber optic, and common towers. Socioeconomic infrastructure covers government facilities, education, health, social welfare, housing, and solid waste and septage infrastructure.

## Sectoral Assessment

The Bangsamoro government has intensified its efforts to ensure that the region's infrastructure development projects are inclusive, innovative, people-centered, resilient, and sustainable.

Despite the development efforts of the BARMM, there are still challenges that need to be addressed in the infrastructure sector, such as improving transportation connectivity; maintaining the quality of water-related infrastructure and full utilization of water sources; enhancing the energy utilization and strengthening the support in the development of possible sources of renewable energy; establishing strategic ICT infrastructures and systems; and supporting the socioeconomic related infrastructures for the upliftment of the lives of the Bangsamoro. The Bangsamoro government hopes to achieve sustainable and climate-resilient infrastructures with the extensive support and cooperation of the development stakeholders in the region.

## Sectoral Trends

### Land Transport

#### BARMM accounts only 3.0 percent of the national roads of the country

Despite its large land area, BARMM only has 1,038.35 kilometers of national roads. This represents only 3.0 percent of the total length of national roads in the country. About 24 percent of the region's national roads are in bad to poor condition. BARMM remains to have the lowest national road density compared to other regions. It has not reached Mindanao's average road density of 0.25 and is still very low compared to the national average of 0.10.

#### Lanao del Sur has the largest local road length

The total road length of Lanao del Sur province accounts for 24.71 percent of the region's local road length, which sums to 2,840.78 kilometers. Maguindanao del Norte now comes second with 2,034.00 kilometers of local roads or 17.69 percent of the total road network, and Maguindanao del Sur is in third place with 1,851.61 kilometers of road length or 16.10 percent of the total road network. Out of the six provinces, Tawi-Tawi has the shortest local road length at 899.94 kilometers. With the addition of SGA and Cotabato City in BARMM, about 982.75 kilometers length of roads have been added to BARMM's local roads.

#### Basilan registers the highest pavement ratio

Among the six BARMM provinces, Basilan registered the highest proportion of paved local roads to the province's total local roads at 61.52 percent. This is followed by Lanao del Sur at 40.45 percent and Sulu and Maguindanao del Norte at 39.93 percent and 39.86 percent, respectively. The SGA has the lowest pavement ratio at 29.02 percent, while Cotabato City recorded a pavement ratio at 59.33 percent.

### Water Transport

One of the common means of transportation in the BARMM is water transport, considering its geographical location. The mainland and island provinces are surrounded by big bodies of water such as the Moro Gulf, Celebes Sea, and Sulu Sea.

There are 17 major ports in the BARMM. The Polloc Port is administered by the BEZA. The other 12 major ports are under the BPMA, while the other minor ports in the region are administered by LGUs and some are privately owned.

**Table 11.1 Ports, by Location, Management, and Capacity**

| No. | Name of Port | Location (Province) | Management (Private or Government) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Polloc Port (administered by BEZA) | Maguindanao | Government |

### Air Transport

The most convenient mode of transportation to the region's neighboring islands is air travel. However, there are no direct flights between the island and the mainland provinces of the region other than Cotabato City-Tawi-Tawi route. The region's insufficient domestic airport facilities are a key barrier to boosting regional investment and growth. The Civil Aeronautics Board of the Bangsamoro (CABB) observes that as the inbound and outbound air passenger increases, airport operations that facilitate both passenger and cargo flow will need to be modernized and simplified to streamline and automate procedures including check-in, security, customs, boarding, disembarking, and luggage delivery. With this, a variety of technologies have been implemented in some airports in the region. Though the elimination of defects and congestion will result in additional costs for airlines and passengers, these changes will increase air traffic flow, boost connectivity, and lower operational costs.

The airports' ability to operate at night safely and efficiently is limited by factors such as the absence of available flights; absence of aeronautical ground lighting system; damaged runway surfaces; inadequate transport infrastructure, and poor quality transport services and security; structures that are dangerously close to runways; encroachment by squatter settlements; movement of animals; unauthorized people in primary operation areas; and a lack of approach and airstrip lights. Additionally, it hinders the airports from hosting additional regular domestic flights.

With this, the Bangsamoro government shall establish international civil aviation safety standards, balance network growth, enable more affordable domestic freight and passenger transportation, and maximize airline fleet utilization by using bigger aircraft, night landing facilities, and other measures like all-weather infrastructure.

Out of 25 airports in Mindanao, there are six airports in the BARMM, three are operational, while the other three are non-operational but classified as community airports. There is no international airport in the region. The Awang Airport also known as Cotabato Airport located in Datu Odin Sinsuat, Maguindanao del Norte is classified as Principal Class I. The two other airports classified as Principal Class II airports are in Sanga-Sanga, Tawi-Tawi and Jolo, Sulu. The other three airports classified as community airports are in Malabang, Lanao del Sur, Cagayan de Sulu in Mapun, Tawi-Tawi, and Wao, Lanao del Sur.

These airports are jointly administered by the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP), a body responsible for the operation of all airports in the country, and the Bangsamoro Airport Authority (BAA), a counterpart agency of CAAP-National, under the umbrella of MOTC-BARMM, responsible for the landside management of all airports within BARMM. Sibutu airstrip, however, is still not recognized by CAAP National and still to be developed for future use to accommodate small aircrafts.

**Table 11.2 BARMM Airports, Location, Classification, and Status**

| No. | Name of Airport | Location | Classification | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Awang Airport | Awang DOS, Maguindanao | Principal Class I | Operational |
| 2 | Sanga-Sanga Airport | Bongao, Tawi-Tawi | Principal Class II | Operational |
| 3 | Jolo Airport | Jolo, Sulu | Principal Class II | Operational |
| 4 | Malabang Airport | Malabang, Lanao del Sur | Community | Non-Operational |
| 5 | Wao | Wao, Lanao del Sur | Community | Non-Operational |
| 6 | Mapun | Mapun, Tawi-Tawi | Community | Non-Operational |

#### Awang Airport

Cotabato Airport is the most accessible airport for inbound and outbound passengers and cargo serving Cotabato City, Maguindanao, and Lanao del Sur in BARMM and provinces of Sultan Kudarat and Cotabato in Region XII. CAAP has classified Cotabato Airport as Principal Class I in the major domestic airport. It is a principal commercial gateway that can accommodate narrow-bodied jets such as the Airbus 320. The Cotabato Airport is in DOS, Maguindanao is operational for more than five decades. Being an old airport, its facilities are dilapidated and deteriorating. The rehabilitation of the arrival and pre-departure building of the Cotabato airport is now ongoing with an allocation of Php41,427,313.88 funded by CAAP-National.

Cotabato Airport has a total land area of 91.81 hectares and its elevation is 58 meters above sea level and with latitudes of 7.1652417 N and 124.2096194 E. The runway is concrete with a total asphalt overlay and has a total width of 45 meters and a total length of 2,000 meters. The apron area is 110 meters x 256 meters. With the given apron area, Cotabato Airport can accommodate 3-4 flights of domestic aircraft at the same time. Currently, there are four regular flights daily from Manila-Cotabato-Manila, one regular flight from Cotabato - Tawi-Tawi — Cotabato every Monday and Thursday, and one regular flight from Cotabato-Zamboanga-Cotabato every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

Based on JICA study, Cotabato Airport should be relocated to other area because of its unpleasant topographic conditions. It is surrounded by high grounds, the Mt. Cabalalaan as the highest point and the Linangan Mountains being the most pronounced. The range of the 650-meter-high Mt. Cabalalaan is situated three to four kilometers southwest of the airport and within the inner horizontal and conical surface, and is expected to cause visual limitations for circling operations of the aircrafts. The same is true with Linangan Mountain with a maximum elevation of 360 meters with five kilometers in the southeast of the airport and south of the eastern approach zone. Another reason for its relocation is due to the condition of the runway, which is uneconomical to expand. It has a total length of about 2,000 meters, but its effective length between its threshold markings is only about 1,975.5 meters.

#### Sanga-Sanga Airport

It covers the broad area of Bongao, the provincial capital of Tawi-Tawi. The CAAP has designated it as a Principal Class II domestic airport. This serves as the main commercial entry point for aircraft with narrow bodies like the Airbus 319 and 320. The airport is in Barangay Sanga-Sanga, Bongao, Tawi-Tawi.

Among the issues and concerns of the airport are inadequate essential infrastructure airport facilities, security equipment and machinery, reliable internet connection, and lack of skilled manpower. Also, the airport has limited Ramp/Apron, an extremely constrained area that can only accommodate one medium aircraft at a time. Currently, there are two regular flights from Zamboanga to Tawi-Tawi and one regular flight from Cotabato to Tawi-Tawi. The airport has no backup generator that could be used in the event of a power outage to keep operations running smoothly.

In 2005, the runway was extended to 1,860 meters through a partnership between the DOTC (now renamed as DOTr) and extended again to 2,160 linear meters in the earlier part of 2021. In addition, the runway has been widened to 45 meters, which is one of the minimum requirements of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

#### Jolo Airport

It is located in Jolo, Sulu serving the populace of the province. It is classified as Principal Class II in the minor domestic airport. It also serves as a gateway to military aircraft and other small aircraft such as platinum skies. Among the issues confronting the airport are: limited space for development and expansion; inadequate airport facilities for airside and landside operation; lack of skilled manpower; and absence of commercial space and storage facilities for the concessionaires, stakeholders, and other business sectors.

Sky Pasada is the only air carrier operating in the airport, which runs every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and with frequent military flights. It has a concrete runway with a total length of 1,840 meters long with good condition and is oriented at 9-27 east-west direction.

#### Community Airports in BARMM

**Malabang Airport.** It is classified as a community airport or a minor community airport located in the coastal town of Malabang, Lanao del Sur. The airport facilities such as the terminal building and a ramp or taxiway are dilapidated and are no longer operational. It has a concrete runway with a total length of 1,360 meters long in good condition and oriented at 6-24 direction.

**Wao Airport.** It serves the general area of Wao and nearby municipalities located in the province of Lanao del Sur. It is classified as a community airport and used by a few privately-operated aircraft. There is no facility erected on the site other than the macadam-type airstrip with a total length of one kilometer oriented at 18-36 direction.

**Cagayan de Sulu Airport (Mapun).** It is a small community airport sometimes called Mapun Airport situated in Mapun, Tawi-Tawi, used mainly by military aircrafts and designated as a local airport by the CAAP. Recently, Mapun Airstrip is operating chartered and military flights that can accommodate six passengers, light to medium ability aircraft, such as the Hercules (C-130) and Cessna 172. One to two chartered flights each day from Palawan and Zamboanga are operated by the Philippines Adventist Medical Aviation Services (PAMAS). The runway is a flattened area of natural land that is about 1,300 meters long and 30 to 40 meters wide, and it is encircled by dense vegetation. On both traffic circuits, there are also mountainous regions and high terrains, however, the heights and distances are not known. The outdated airport terminal building is the only available facility in the airport.

**Sibutu Airstrip.** It is located in the province of Tawi-Tawi. The current state of the airstrip is uneven and not suitable for accommodating airplanes. The airstrip is parallel to a municipal road that is against ICAO and Standard and Recommended Practices (SARP) guidelines and located near a tactical operations group station. The airstrip is 852 meters long and has a width of 18 to 25 meters.

As shown in Figure 11.9, the Bangsamoro government proposes for an additional air routes to improve connectivity of the region with the neighboring regions and BIMP-EAGA and boost economic development in the region.

**Figure 11.10 Number of Passengers at Awang, Sanga-Sanga, and Jolo Airport**

| Year | Airport | In-coming Passengers | Out-going Passengers | Total No. of Passengers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2019 | Awang | 146,446 | 146,348 | 292,794 |
| 2019 | Sanga-Sanga | 65,396 | 69,485 | 134,881 |
| 2019 | Jolo | 9,824 | 10,137 | 19,961 |
| 2020 | Awang | 52,466 | 44,362 | 96,828 |
| 2020 | Sanga-Sanga | 65,396 | 69,485 | 134,881 |
| 2020 | Jolo | 3,620 | 3,704 | 7,324 |
| 2021 | Awang | 75,558 | 88,199 | 163,757 |
| 2021 | Sanga-Sanga | 8,994 | 9,382 | 18,376 |

The pandemic has generally slowed down the number of flights resulting to sharp decline in aviation revenue. Based on the passenger traffic data from 2003 to 2019, an abrupt increase in Passenger Traffic is observed from 5.0 percent to 56 percent. Since 2020, passenger and flight volumes has decreased up to 67 percent.

The increased and decreased movements of annual passenger air traffic, annual flight traffic, and annual cargo traffic which are shown in the table above are based on the needs or demands of the air transport industry. Jolo Airport canceled its operation in 2019 due to the lower demand for air travels. Only a charter flight or Sky Pasada is operating at Jolo Airport. Also, the COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected the economic activity not only in the BARMM but the entire country as well. This is due to the several protocols and safety measures imposed by the national government, particularly on health documents, travel restriction policies, and others.

### Water Resources

#### 25.4 percent of households in BARMM have limited access to potable water

There are still families with limited access to potable water. About 74.6 percent of families in BARMM have access to potable water. This is lower than the national average of 92.9 percent, despite having vast water resources. This indicates that 25.4 percent of the households have inadequate access to potable water supply.

Most of the communities are vulnerable to water-borne diseases with many poor families relying on unprotected and contaminated water resources. This suggests an urgent need to focus on the provision of water system or the promotion of household water treatment options in BARMM.

#### Flood Control

The mainland BARMM, particularly cities, and municipalities downstream of Mindanao River Basin (MRB), has an inherent constraint in pursuing effective flood control programs because the upper catchment areas of the Rio Grande and its tributaries are outside the territory of the BARMM. In the upper catchment areas (outside BARMM), the degradation of forest resources has been continuing. In addressing the frequent flooding in the low-lying areas in Maguindanao, the approach must encompass the entire MRB covering Regions X, XII, and BARMM. This is a massive undertaking that necessitates the leadership of the national government, particularly the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and to be supported by various entities in Mindanao including the BARMM.

There was an effort to holistically address the flooding through the Mindanao River Basin Integrated Management and Development Masterplan (MRBIMDMP) completed in 2014. However, a significant number of flood control projects recommended by the plan have not been realized including the Ambal-Simuay River Flood Control Project, and the Mindanao River (Rio Grande) Flood Control Project, among others. It has been eight years since the completion of the MRBIMDMP, hence, updating the plan to reflect the changes in the MRB and ascertaining the status and practicability of the identified projects is necessary.

The Bangsamoro government does not only want to address the recurrent floods that destroyed the livelihood of Bangsamoro and put their lives at risk. But it shall also pursue a proactive stance to accelerate socioeconomic development in the municipalities within the flood-prone areas which are mostly located in the periphery of Ligawasan Marsh. For that reason, the updated MRBIMDMP may have the following components presented in the table below.

**Table 11.3 Mindanao River Basin Integrated Management and Development Masterplan Components**

| Item | Details | Programme |
|---|---|---|
| a. Flood control infrastructure | Study of the MRB to come up with effective flood control management/measures. The study shall cover the entire MRB including the upper most stream of the rivers (origin) and downstream most of the rivers (discharge or mouth in Cotabato City and surrounding areas). Aside from river bank protection, recommendations of the study may include construction of water impounding system at the upper streams of the rivers to control their flow to Ligawasan Marsh which causes immediate flooding as well as dredging of affected sections of the rivers by sedimentation. Review of flood control projects proposed by different agencies shall be included in the study. Some non-infrastructure measures like enacting laws and regulations to protect watersheds, early warning systems, etc. | Flood Control Infrastructure Programme - the programme may compose of (i) water impounding system at the upper stream of the rivers, (ii) flood control system including improving river channels, water diversion/channel cutting, and riverbank improvement, (iii) sediment and siltation control system, (iv) flood forecasting and warning system, among others. |
| b. Road network around the marsh (both trunk road and farm to market road) | Study of the current condition of the existing roads around the Ligawasan Marsh. Proposed future road network of the Ligawasan Marsh that include both trunk road (national, provincial, municipal road) and farm-to-market road. | Ligawasan Marsh Road Network Development Programme - the programme may consist of (i) road rehabilitation project, (ii) missing link road development project, (iii) construction of new road project. In all the projects, farm-to-market roads shall always be part of the project to extend the project's influence to the most vulnerable members of the communities. |
| c. Water transport system including boat landings in the strategic locations around the marsh and along the Pulangi river | Identify the river transport routes within Ligawasan Marsh and prepare and execute necessary improvement plans. Boat landing shall be constructed along the identified river transport routes. All boat landings shall be connected to the trunk road to realize smooth flow of people and goods (intermodal transport) from origin (community) to final destination (e.g., market at the municipality). | Ligawasan Marsh Water Transport System Development Programme - the programme may consist of (i) water transport route improvement project, (ii) boat landing construction project, (iii) water transport safety improvement project. |
| d. Support facilities for farmers, fishermen and other communities of the marsh | Study of the main source of livelihood of each community around the marsh and provide necessary facilities depending on their needs. For example, a dryer and warehouse for farming communities and cold chain facilities for fishing communities. | Ligawasan Marsh Community Support Development Programme - the programme may include: (i) installation of community facilities such as schools, health centers, barangay halls, dryer, warehouse, public plazas with sports facilities, etc., (iii) formulation of livelihood support programme including supply of farm/fishing equipment. The practice of labor-based construction methods shall be practiced to support the communities in increasing their income. |

Despite the Bangsamoro government's inherent constraints in addressing holistically the issue of flooding particularly those within the MRB, the MPW is steadfast in the implementation of flood control projects in close coordination with various entities. From 2019-2022, MPW has implemented a total of 159 flood control projects including drainage systems in the eight districts of BARMM including SGA and Cotabato City. Although these projects have somehow helped alleviate the flooding problem in the targeted low-lying areas of the region, there are still flood-prone zones specifically in the provinces of Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur that are vulnerable to perennial flooding. Aside from the effects of climate change and urbanization, among the causes for this high vulnerability are unregulated occupation along flood-prone areas, insufficient drainage systems, and poor management of major river basins. Deforestation in the upper stream areas worsens the situation since there is not enough land cover/vegetation for water to infiltrate into the soil, thus increasing surface runoff and in effect exacerbating flooding occurrences downstream and causes soil erosion.

Hence, there is a need to approach these problems in a holistic manner to secure long-term solutions. Coordination among concerned ministries, offices, and stakeholders must be strengthened and the involvement of the national government being the main body in the implementation of infrastructure projects for BARMM's major river basins must be ensured. A masterplan for river basin management which consists of programs for the implementation of structural and non-structural measures to address the flooding problems must be formulated.

Similarly, flooding occurrences in the coastal areas of the mainland provinces must be dealt with in a holistic method as well. A masterplan for coastal protection against storm surges, tsunamis and other coastal disasters has to be in place in order to provide a long-term solution to coastal flooding.

In the first semester of 2022, a total of 99,250 families were affected by flooding. In addition, 3,115.8 hectares of agricultural land were recorded to be damaged by the rampaging waters. The Bangsamoro government is never remiss in its obligation in extending support to flood victims.

### Energy

#### Lowest electrification rate in the country

Based on the latest data from the Department of Energy (DOE), more than half of the households in the region is not energized, accounting only 48 percent of the total number of households electrified. In line with the operating electric service providers, Tawi-Tawi is the least electrified province under Tawi-Tawi Electric Cooperative (TAWELCO), while Cotabato City including some parts of Datu Odin Sinsuat and Sultan Kudarat, Maguindanao under Cotabato Light and Power Corporation has the highest electrification rate in the region. Table 11.14 shows the status of electrification per distribution utility in BARMM.

### ICT Infrastructure

#### Lagging in digital infrastructure

Based on the 2019 National ICT Household Survey in the Philippines, BARMM was left behind in terms of digital communication. Results of the survey indicates that BARMM has:

- The highest percentage of households without internet access at 95.5 percent and with the highest number of individuals who are not using the internet at 86.6 percent;
- The highest percentage of households without a computer at 91.5 percent and has the least number of individuals using a computer at 9.1 percent;
- The highest percentage of households without a fixed telephone line posted at 98.2 percent;
- The least percentage of households with radio at 20.3 percent;
- The least percentage of households with television at 47.5 percent;
- The least number of individuals accessing government websites at 7.8 percent;

## Opportunities

**Utilization of natural resources.** BARMM is one of the richest regions in Mindanao when it comes to energy resources. It is well endowed with indigenous energy resources such as oil, natural gas, coal, solar, hydropower, geothermal, wind, and other renewable energy resources. Right investments in harnessing and developing these energy resources may aid and spur economic development in the region. These energy resources can be an avenue to solve the perennial problem of BARMM in power generation and distribution.

**Rich oil and gas reserves in the region.** Looking at the oil and gas potential of the entire Mindanao, BARMM has two of the largest oil and gas basins in the country, namely: the Sulu Sea Basin and Cotabato Basin. Cotabato Basin, which is adjacent to and partly overlaps to Ligawasan Marsh that stretches through Maguindanao, North Cotabato, and Sultan Kudarat provinces, is rich in oil and natural gas reserves, as well as extensive fisheries and aquatic resources. The marsh has been designated as a bird sanctuary and game reserve. Cotabato Basin has an area of 14,000 square kilometers and is estimated to have a total resource potential of 158 million barrels of oil equivalent. Oil potential has been estimated at 83 million barrels (MMB), while its gas potential stands at 415 billion cubic feet (BCF).

Another huge source of oil and gas in the BARMM is the Sulu Sea Basin which is in Western Mindanao and has an area of 115,000 kilometers and is estimated to have an oil potential of 130 MMB and a gas potential of 409 BCF.

Under the new Philippine Conventional Energy Contracting Program (PCECP), the DOE held a series of roadshows around the Philippines in 2018 to encourage oil and gas development. Some of these Predetermined Areas (PDA) of the DOE are strategically located in BARMM that are potential for petroleum exploration and development activities. The PDAs include one in Cotabato and three in Sulu. In addition to these, the PCECP now allows prospective investors to suggest places outside of the recognized PDAs, including one in Sulu.

On downstream oil industry, most of the drivers of economic development rely on the utilization of petroleum products such as diesel, petroleum, kerosene, LPG, petrochemicals, lubricants, and other petroleum-related products. This area is currently regulated by the DOE and MENRE in the territorial jurisdiction of BARMM.

**One of the biggest potential coal reserves in the country.** Coal is likely to remain a major fuel for power generation in the future despite its negative effect on the environment. The Philippine government is continuously promoting the exploration and development of indigenous coal resources in the country. BARMM has one of the biggest potential coal reserves in the country located in the province of Maguindanao. Maguindanao has been proven to have a significant amount of coal estimated at 108 million metric tons (MMMT). Despite the opportunities in coal, the Bangsamoro government has not utilized its full potential due to a lack of policies and guidelines, particularly on the responsible offices that shall govern the development of the coal reserves in the region.

**High hydropower potential of the region.** According to the Mindanao Energy Plan (MEP) 2014-2030, it is estimated that the hydropower potential in the country is equivalent to 1,379.32 MW with 238 potential sites identified in Mindanao. Of the total potential resources, DOE identified 17 potential sites inside the BARMM territory which could provide a total aggregate capacity of 27.15 MW.

**Untapped potential of solar energy.** Solar energy is one of the most promising renewable energy resources in Mindanao. Studies conducted by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) indicated that Mindanao Island has high potential power generating capacity with an average amount of 5-5.5 KW/m²/day. BARMM currently has two solar power generation facilities located in Sitangkai and Sibutu in the province of Tawi-Tawi which are funded by European Union - Access to Sustainable Energy Programme in partnership with the national government agencies, academes, P/MLGUs, MENRE, MAFAR, and private stakeholders.

**High potential sources for geothermal power.** The geothermal power potential resources estimated as of December 2013 are 290 MW in Mindanao. Table 11.13 shows the geothermal power potential resources in the BARMM. To date, no additional geothermal power plants are planned to be developed in the BARMM.

**Table 11.13 Number of Geothermal Sites and Potential Capacities in BARMM**

| Province | No. of Sites | Potential Capacity (MW) | Pre-Development Investment Requirement (PHP 10⁶) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Maguindanao | 8 | 5.23 | 562.23 |
| Lanao Del Sur | 7 | 11.29 | 1,213.68 |
| Sulu | 2 | 10.63 | 1,142.73 |
| **Total** | **17** | **27.15** | **2,918.64** |

**Rich biomass resources.** Mindanao is endowed with rich biomass resources due to its inherent high land productivity. According to the biomass potential map issued by the DOE, rice bagasse potential resources are estimated to be at 4.47 MW and coconuts at 84.87 MW. In 2015, two projects in biomass power plants in Maguindanao underwent commissioning and the output of each power plant is 1.6 MW and 10 MW, respectively.

Currently, there are two existing biomass facilities in BARMM. These are the 15-MW Biomass Power Plant Project awarded to Lamsan Power Corporation in Sultan Kudarat, and 5MW Biomass Power Plant operated by Green Earth Enersource Corporation (GEEC) at Buluan, Maguindanao del Sur.

**High potential for ocean energy sources.** BARMM is also rich in ocean energy due to its archipelagic nature. There are five identified tidal and ocean energy potential sites in the region. Two of these are in Sulu and three are in Tawi-Tawi. The said projects are estimated to have a total potential capacity of 8 MW.

**Table 11.4 Ocean Energy Potential Sources in BARMM**

| Location | Plant | Estimated Capacity (MW) |
|---|---|---|
| Sulu | Baculus-Bulaan Island | 1.00 |
| Sulu | Lugus-Tapul Island | 2.50 |
| Tawi-Tawi | Northern Sibutu | 2.50 |
| Tawi-Tawi | Sibutu Island | 1.00 |
| Tawi-Tawi | Simunul | 1.00 |
| **Total** | | **8.00** |

**Availability and access to digital platforms.** ICT is a term that is used to describe the use of computers, mobile phones, and other devices for storing, retrieving, and exchanging information. Digital transformation has been made possible with the availability of ICT. Digital transformation can be defined as an evolution in the way organizations conduct their business operations. This evolution is driven by ICTs that are used to create new business models, processes, and services. Being reliant on private service providers will not address immediately the access to ICT challenges. Hence, it is an opportunity for the Bangsamoro government to build its ICT infrastructure such as common towers, data centers, and fiber backbone through PPP.

**Presence of the IGRB.** The IGRB is a special body of the Bangsamoro government and the national government that provides an institutional mechanism for sustained cooperation and coordination between the BARMM and the national government. It also serves as a platform for discussion and dispute resolution for intergovernmental issues. The IGRB is most beneficial to the operation of the concerned BARMM MOAs, having an operative mechanism to elevate issues concerning the jurisdiction of BARMM government agencies' powers and functions to the national government level that can effectively address matters of immediate concern.

**Adoption of appropriate existing national guidelines and policies.** ICT is a rapidly evolving and growing field. In the past, ICT has been considered as a separate field from other disciplines such as education, health, finance, agriculture, etc. However, in recent years ICT has become an integral part of these fields.

To address the rapid growth of ICTs in different disciplines and sectors of society, it is important to develop policies that are appropriate in the BARMM. National guidelines and policies provide a guide on how to implement or use technologies in specific contexts and sectors of society. The DICT launched the National Cybersecurity Plan which is timely for BARMM to adapt. This policy will guard the region against cyber threats.

**Support from the national government and other foreign agencies.** To ensure funding for the implementation of priority infrastructure projects in the region, the Bangsamoro government shall strengthen its coordination and collaboration with the national government to operationalize the provision of Section 23, Article XII of the BOL which states that "Immediately after the ratification of this Organic Law, and for another five years thereafter, the National government shall provide for additional funds that will subsidize expenditures for development projects and infrastructure in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, including provincial and municipal roads in accordance with the development plan formulated by the Bangsamoro government. The national government and the Bangsamoro government, through the IGRB shall agree on the amount and manner of the release of said amount to the Bangsamoro government". In addition, the Bangsamoro government shall pursue the possibility of financial assistance from partnered foreign agencies, which shall complement the initiatives of the Bangsamoro government in the development of the region.

**Public-Private Partnership (PPP).** PPP can be broadly defined as a contractual agreement between the government and private firms targeted toward financing, designing, implementing, and operating infrastructure facilities and services that were traditionally provided by the public sector. Exploring the implementation of projects through PPP will not just address the limited funding resources for local infrastructure or development projects of the public sector, but it will also allow the allocation of public funds for other priorities.

## Priority Challenges to be Addressed in 2023-2028

One of the key challenges to be addressed in 2023-2028 under the transport sub-sector is the **inadequate transport infrastructure and poor-quality transport services**. This is associated with:

**Inadequate and poor quality of existing road network.** The BARMM must push for the completion and expansion of national roads for the interconnectivity of BARMM provinces and cities with the other growth centers. These include road sections connecting Lanao del Sur - Lanao del Norte - Bukidnon - Zamboanga - Maguindanao - Sultan Kudarat - Cotabato province - Davao City. There are also new roads proposed as national road by various studies (e.g., West Diversion Road by the JICA's Greater Cotabato Urban Infrastructure Study) that have to be pursued to further reduce the road density gap between BARMM and other regions in Mindanao.

The BARMM shall continuously pursue the concreting of all the provincial roads and shall develop roads leading to potential eco-tourism and farm-to-market road areas in the provinces and cities of the region. In the medium and long-term, there is a need to formulate a road network masterplan showing the current network and the ultimate target network formation in the future. Part of this masterplan is the demarcation of roads to be administered by the DPWH, MPW, and LGUs.

**Insufficient inter-island transportation system.** The most convenient mode of transportation to the region's neighboring islands is by sea and air travel. There are no direct flights between the island's provinces including far-flung/remote islands and the mainland provinces of the region except in Tawi-Tawi. The region's insufficient domestic airport and seaport facilities and available air and sea routes are key barriers to boosting regional investment and economic growth.

Formulation of a Transportation Master Plan must be pursued to provide a more substantive study that will define the needs of the transportation industry and in coming up with a quality inter-island transportation system.

**Growing capacity constraint on domestic transport gateways.** Nowadays, the land, air, and sea transport traffic increase at a higher rate than the capacity of the facility. Population grows yearly so as the travelers. As the demand continues to grow in the future, so the problem of capacity shortage is anticipated. Hence, resulting to congestion and delays if the facility cannot match this demand.

**Deteriorating and dilapidated seaport and airport facilities.** In public transport, deteriorating and dilapidated land, seaport, and airport facilities are factors of congestion phenomena, which can trigger disastrous gear when general forms of congestion combine and reinforce each other. Thus, the Bangsamoro government must provide additional safety and quality transport facilities based on the needs of the region.

Another challenge is the inadequate seaport and airport facilities that downscale their capacity to encourage and manage more domestic and international passenger and cargo traffic. During the assessment of the assets turned over to the MOTC, it was observed that some of these existing assets and equipment of the recognized airports and seaports in BARMM are deteriorating and dilapidated which causes poor-quality transport services.

**Non-functional governing boards.** Upon the devolution of powers and functions of the national offices to BARMM, the MOTC attached agencies consisting of BLTFRB, BLTO, BMARINA, BPMA, BTC, BAA, and CABB must establish their governing boards to assist in the formulation of policies and guidelines that will instigate positive and sustainable change in the said attached agencies.

A key challenge to be addressed under the water resources sub-sector is the **Limited access to potable water and irrigation system, and the high vulnerability risk to disaster**. This is associated with a limited number of households and commercial businesses with access to potable water; high vulnerability and exposure to flooding and coastal disaster; limited rice fields and other high-value crop production areas with access to an irrigation system; and absence of sewerage system, treatment, and disposal facilities.

A core problem that needs to be addressed is **inadequate access to energy resources, facilities, and services**. This is associated with:

**Insufficient and unreliable electric power industry.** The status of the Electric Power Industry in the region is alarming. The electric service providers are crucial in the economic activities of various enterprises and households. To provide effective, efficient, and reliable services, the Bangsamoro government needs to step up its programs, projects, and activities that will help these service providers to give better services to their member-consumers.

**Low level of household electrification.** A total of 2,444 out of 2,450 target barangays in BARMM are energized as of December 2021. However, in terms of electricity connection, only 251,003 households or 42 percent of the 602,942 household has potential service connections based on the 2015 CPH.

BARMM energization coverage in sitios has the lowest development rate among the six regions in Mindanao. This represents 795 sitios yet to be energized out of the 2,361 coverage sitios. BARMM is beset with constant power interruptions, especially in far-flung sitios and barangays. This has been a major bottleneck for economic development in the region.

**Untapped potential renewable and non-renewable energy sources.** BARMM only recently acquired the power and authority to supervise and regulate the energy sector in the region through exclusive and co-managed powers as stated in RA 11054 or the BOL.

During the transition period, the national government and the Bangsamoro government created a platform to help BARMM in capacitating and exercising its powers and functions in the energy sector through the Intergovernmental Energy Board (IEB). The DOE acknowledged that the energy sector institutions of BARMM still need to be developed and are currently undermanned. In response to this, the IEB created seven TWGs to discuss and solve issues related to the energy sector and gradually capacitate and transfer powers and functions of DOE to BARMM that are explicitly stated under RA 11054.

**Insufficient enabling policies.** Currently, the only institution serving the energy sector of the region is the Energy Management and Development Services under the MENRE. Compared with the national government institutions that are currently governing and regulating the energy sector of the country, the Bangsamoro government needs to update and upgrade its institutions to properly manage, supervise, and regulate the complex energy sector which is vital to the sustainable socioeconomic development of the region.

There is a vast difference in the institutional capacity of the national and Bangsamoro government in managing the energy sector. The national government has at least six institutions including GOCCs that govern the energy sector namely: the DOE, NEA, NPC, Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM Corp.), Philippine National Oil Corporation (PNOC), and Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC).

The national government has institutions with numerous numbers of bureaus, divisions, sections, and units that are tasked with the energy security of the country while the Bangsamoro government has only one bureau with two divisions that are handling all matters about the energy sector in the region.

This challenge should be studied and prioritized by the Bangsamoro Parliament to fully utilize the acquired powers and functions of the Bangsamoro government in the energy sector and become one of the main drivers of sustainable socioeconomic development in the region.

Another key challenge that needs to be addressed is **inadequate ICT infrastructure**. The issue of poor internet connection of the different line agencies and other establishments in BARMM hampered economic and government agencies' transactions that utilize communication through the network internet access.

Another key challenge that needs to be addressed is **inadequate access to socioeconomic infrastructure**. This is associated with:

**Inadequate access to affordable and decent housing.** Based on 2020 PSA data, the BARMM has 38.88 percent housing backlogs which is equivalent to 281,686 households with no access to affordable and decent housing.

**Inadequate access to health facilities.** One of the challenges in BARMM is the inadequate access to health facilities in far-flung areas and the poor condition of some health facilities. Some health stations are dilapidated and without basic equipment. (refer to Table 9.7 of Chapter 9)

**Inadequate access to education facilities.** The major underlying reason for poor access of the people to education is the inadequacy of school facilities and learning resources (refer to 9.3 in Chapter 9). In far-flung areas, limited school facilities resulted in the absenteeism of both teachers and students.

**Insufficient Agri-fishery facilities.** Despite the potential of aquaculture and commercial fisheries (refer to Table 7.6 of chapter 7), insufficient agri-fishery facilities are one of the hindrances to developing the agri-fishery industry in the BARMM. Insufficient facilities affect the operation of the agri-fisheries industries and decelerate the realization of innovations in technology.

**Inadequate infrastructures to support improvements required in ecozone and freeport standards.** BARMM is confronted with lack of modernized equipment for freeport and ecozone operations, unfunded wharf extensions, inadequate capital investment in infrastructures, freeports, and ecozone development, and lack of a Relocation Action Plan for informal settlers.

**Poor solid waste management.** Most of the LGUs in BARMM have no appropriate sanitary landfill and material recovery facilities.

### Priority Programs

#### Integrated Transportation Infrastructure and Modernization Program

This program is geared towards providing better and more reliable transportation systems and services to BARMM constituents. Under this program, the following are the five identified projects: a) Integrated Transportation Master Plan Project; b) Airport Development and Maintenance Project, c) Seaport Development and Maintenance Project; d) Maritime Development and Maintenance Project; and e) Digitization Project.

#### Regional Road Network Development and Management Program

This program aims for the establishment of BARMM regional road network through conversion of targeted provincial roads, municipal roads, and barangays roads into regional roads for development and management by BARMM region. Construction of new roads to complete the formation of the regional road network might necessary as well. The proposed regional road network will provide a seamless inter-connectivity among adjacent BARMM provinces as well as neighboring regions. It will also serve as an alternate route to existing national roads in the region. The immediate targets for road conversion are the major road sections that did not qualify for conversion to national roads. There were 51 road sections across the five provinces of BARMM that were proposed to DPWH Central Office for conversion to national roads in 2021. Some of the proposed roads did not meet the criteria set by the national government for conversion. These road sections shall be part of the proposed BARMM Regional Road Network.

#### Road and Bridge Development Program

Efficient land transportation plays an essential part in the socioeconomic development of any region. The Bangsamoro government recognizes the need for a strategic road and bridge network that will ensure safe, convenient, environment-friendly, and reliable public land transportation for the benefit of the public and safeguard the movement of goods and services. BARMM was a conflict-affected area for so long that most of the municipalities' infrastructure was devastated and torn. As a result, people from far-flung communities could not access basic services and other assistance from the government. Therefore, the Bangsamoro government's priority includes infrastructure development in the region not only to boost economic development activities but also to ensure the connectivity and safety of its people for better development opportunities.

This program aims to develop and deliver an adequate, efficient, safe, and sustainable road and bridge network in the region local and national connectivity. It will also provide enhancement of transportation capacity and efficiency in GIDAs in BARMM, through the construction and improvement of access roads to arterial road which improves accessibilities and linkages to BARMM cities, road safety management, and improve traffic flows and safety for all road users. Under this program, the projects are the following: a) Road Construction, Pavement, and Upgrading projects; b) Road Rehabilitation Projects; c) Road Widening Projects; d) Bridge Construction Projects; and e) Bridge Rehabilitation Projects.

#### Port Development Program

This program aims to contribute to the socioeconomic development of the region. A sufficient mooring location that is accessible and safe allows easy transportation of fishermen's goods. This program consists of two projects such as port construction and rehabilitation and port expansion.

#### Water System Development Program

This program aims to address the shortage of potable water supply from the existing water supply system built in the community. Because of the increasing population, the capacity of existing water systems in the community is not able to meet the growing demand. Hence, there is a need to expand the existing water supply system to increase its capacity and accommodate the demands of the growing population. This program has three projects as follows: a) Construction of Level I, II, and III Water System; b) Rehabilitation of Water System; and 3) Expansion of Water System.

#### Natural Disaster Management Program

This program aims to promote safety against natural disasters. Urban and economic stability will also contribute to region's safety and security. This program has two projects namely: a) Construction and Rehabilitation of Flood Control Projects (River Protection, Coastal Protection, Drainage) and b) Construction/Rehabilitation of Slope Protection Project.

#### Agriculture and Fishery Machinery, Equipment, and Infrastructure Program

#### Bangsamoro Broadband Program (BBP)

Aligned with the National Broadband Plan (NBP), the BBP provides the blueprint for broadband infrastructure in the BARMM. It aims to lay the backbone of connectivity networks across the region through the deployment of fiber optic cables and wireless technologies, thereby, improving internet speed and affordability. The BBP aims to ensure that all Filipinos have access to broadband capability through investment in broadband infrastructure, policy reforms, and stimulation of market demand. The projects under this program are the following:

- Laying of regional fiber backbone connected to the existing fiber backbone of the Philippines.
- Construction of a system of cable landing stations. This serves as the BBP's gateway to international connectivity and may also be used to land more capacity into the network. The existing cable landing station is in the Luzon Bypass Infrastructure, but it would be better if a similar project will be constructed in Tawi-Tawi which is deemed closest to Malaysia to easily connect the region internationally.
- Tower buildup to cater to the country's geographically isolated sites and identified missionary areas. This will cover the middle mile and last mile segments of the network.
- Expansion of fiber optic to interconnect government agencies to provide fast, secure, and efficient fiber connectivity and improve the provision of public services to people.
- Deployment of satellite overlay that will enable immediate broadband service to an isolated location.

#### Digital Transformation Program
