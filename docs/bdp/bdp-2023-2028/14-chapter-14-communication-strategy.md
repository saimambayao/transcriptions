This chapter consists of five parts. Section 1 provides the introduction. Section 2 identifies the target audiences and section 3 outlines the communication objectives. Section 4 delves on the key messages and section 5 discusses the different channels or platforms of communication.

## Introduction

The 2nd BDP 2023-2028 is a medium-term plan of the Bangsamoro government for the next six years to sustain the gains and pursue the development thrust, direction, priorities, and strategies outlined in the 1st BDP 2020-2022. This plan further ensures that horizontal and vertical alignment and integration of plans and priorities will also address the pressing issues at the local levels. Hence, a well-defined communication strategy is crafted for effective information dissemination across the region that will inform local officials and other stakeholders regarding the development plan for the Bangsamoro.

This chapter serves as a roadmap for communicating data, information, and knowledge through various strategies that identify key audiences, objectives, key messages, channels/platforms, expected results/outcomes, and frequency/timeframe of the planned activities for the 2nd BDP.

Further, this communication strategy is designed to establish appropriate and specific media/platforms and tools for effective channeling of information enclosed in the 2nd BDP to its key audiences, specifically the BARMM key officials both in executive and legislative bodies, regional and provincial development councils and committees, business and/or private sectors, academe, civil society organizations, development partners, and other stakeholders.

To effectively manage information dissemination, various methods, and platforms of channeling information for specific audiences were identified in this communication strategy.

Below are the main communication channels used by the Bangsamoro government to efficiently disseminate the information content of the 2nd BDP to its key audiences:

### Executive Committee/Development Council/Sectoral, Special and Sub-Committee Meetings

### BTA Parliament Sessions and Other Legislative Meetings

Gaining strong legislative support from the BTA Parliament and other legislative bodies at the local level is a big advantage in promoting the 2nd BDP. The Parliament can pass legislations that are necessary for smooth and continuous implementation of the plan. Thereby, guiding the Bangsamoro government through legislative measures.

### Press Releases and Press Conferences

Weekly press conferences and regular press releases to the press/media provide an opportunity to bring a more detailed overview of progress in implementing the plan.
