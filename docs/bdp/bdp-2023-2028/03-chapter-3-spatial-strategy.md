# Chapter 3: Bangsamoro Spatial Strategy

The Bangsamoro Spatial Strategy (BSS) sets the long-term direction for the development in the BARMM. This chapter introduces the BARMM's vast comparative advantages and potentials that determine the functional roles of its provinces, capital city, and special geographic area that will support and sustain economic development in the region. These functional roles shall support the expansion and emergence of new economies that will sustain economic growth and development across the region.

## Introduction

RA 11054 establishes the BARMM which is composed of the provinces of Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi; and the cities of Marawi, Lamitan, and Cotabato. In addition, 63 barangays from the province of North Cotabato, which is referred to as the Special Geographic Area (SGA), are also included in its territory.

With the ratification of RA 11550 through a plebiscite held on September 17, 2022, the province of Maguindanao is now divided into two: Maguindanao del Norte and Maguindanao del Sur.

## Regional Spatial Strategy

Agglomeration, Connectivity, and Vulnerability Reduction are the three key spatial strategy principles that are vital in the identification of the overall spatial strategy of the BARMM and basis for the assessment of the region's growth centers and functional roles.

### Agglomeration

Agglomeration in BARMM is mainly demonstrated by the hierarchy of settlements which reflects the pattern or structure of settlements laid down in the region. The spatial arrangement and distribution of existing settlement strata or services was based primarily on population size, function, degree of urbanization, and presence of economic and social services. In essence, the larger the population of a settlement, the larger the scale of activities, therefore, the greater opportunities for division of labor and specialization.

### Table 3.4 Hierarchy of Networks of Settlements

| Level | Role | Indicator Functions | Population |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Regional Growth Center | Major center that provides services to national and international companies. | Presence of international port, airport, commerce | 1,200,000 and above |
| Sub-regional Growth Center | Provide support services that serve beyond local boundaries | Presence of national airport, level 3 hospital, commerce, and national developers | 120,000 - 1,200,000 |
| Provincial center | Provincial services and administration | Presence of tertiary level education, level 2 hospital, commercial banks, commerce residential subdivision, auto repair shop, service forwarders, cable | 50,000 - 120,000 |
| Local center | Rural and agricultural services | Presence of food retail, secondary school, primary health care, bus terminal, lodging inn | 50,000 and below |

The urban centers in the BARMM have been classified as regional centers, sub-regional centers, provincial centers, and local centers.

### Table 3.5 BARMM Existing Network of Settlements

| Hierarchy | City and Municipality |
| :--- | :--- |
| Regional Center | Cotabato City* |
| Sub-regional Center | Marawi City, Lamitan*, Jolo*, Datu Odin Sinsuat*, Bongao*, Buluan* |
| Provincial Center | Parang, Upi, Wao, Malabang, Sultan Kudarat, Indanan, Maimbung, Parang, Siasi, Talipao. |
| Local Center | **Basilan:** Lantawan, Maluso, Sumisip, Tipo-Tipo, Tuburan, Akbar, Al-Barka, Hadji Mohammad Ajul, Ungkaya Pukan, Hadji Muhtamad, Tabuan-Lasa, **Maguindanao:** Ampatuan, Buldon, Datu Paglas, Datu Piang, Shariff Aguak, Matanog, Pagalungan, Kabuntalan, Talayan, South Upi, Barira, General Salipada K. Pendatun, Mamasapano, Pagagawan, Sultan Mastura, Datu Saudi Ampatuan, Datu Abdullah Sangki, Rajah Buayan, Datu Blah T. Sinsuat, Datu Anggal Midtimbang, Mangudadatu, Pandag, Northern Kabuntalan, Datu Hoffer Ampatuan, Shariff Saydona Mustapha. **Sulu:** Kalingalan Caluang, Luuk, Hadji Panglima Tahil, Old Panamao, Pangutaran, Tongkil, Panglima Estino, Lugus, Pandami, Omar. **Tawi-Tawi:** Panglima Sugala, Mapun, Simunul, Sitangkai, South Ubian, Tandubas, Languyan, Sapa-Sapa, Sibutu. **Lanao del Sur:** Balabagan, Balindong, Bayang, Binidayan, Bubong, Ganassi, Lumba-Bayabao, Madalum, Malabang, Marantao, Masiu, Piagapo, Poona Bayabao, Saguiaran, Tamparan, Taraka, Marogong, Maguing |

*Note: Did not meet the population criteria but considered regional and sub-regional centers because of the presence of services, and income class.*

In the existing hierarchy of settlements, Cotabato City serves as BARMM's Regional Center based on presence of services, and income class. Being one of the functional urban centers with high access to basic facilities and services, Cotabato City shall serve as the financial and commercial hub. It connects to and serves as service center for provincial and local centers on major services such as financial, commercial, education, and health services as the current seat of the Bangsamoro government. Hence, it plays a critical role in linking strategic areas and business centers that are critical to trade and investments.

In 2050, there are 25 municipalities that will be elevated to sub-regional centers and 73 municipalities for provincial centers in terms of projected population as reflected in Table 3.6. All other municipalities in the region will play their role as local centers of their respective provinces.

Meanwhile, the proposed sub-regional centers will provide the services for its nearby provincial centers towards the realization of its functional roles as provided in Table 3.6.

### Table 3.6 BARMM Hierarchy of Settlements Based on Population Projection, 2050

| Province | Sub-Regional Center | Provincial Center | Local Center |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Maguindanao del Norte** | Datu Odin Sinsuat, Parang, Sultan Kudarat, Upi | Buldon, Matanog, Kabuntalan, Barira, Sultan Mastura, Datu Blah T. Sinsuat, Northern Kabuntalan | All other areas |

| **Tawi-Tawi** | Bongao, Sitangkai, Languyan, Mapun, Sapa-Sapa, Sibutu, Simunul | Panglima Sugala, South Ubian, Tandubas | All other areas |

Moreover, Cotabato City will remain as the regional growth center of the region in 2050 with a projected population of 802,958 and being the primary commercial, financial, and industrial center of the region. It shall likewise continue its role in providing basic services, particularly to the incoming and outgoing visitors and investors in the region.

Further, it is also visualized that in 2050, Cotabato City will stimulate the growth of the region, thus developing into Metro Kutawato consisting the municipalities of Parang, Datu Odin Sinsuat, Sultan Kudarat, Sultan Mastura, and Upi. The creation of Metro Kutawato aims to improve the competitiveness of the region's mainland provinces taking into account the key contributions of other nearby municipalities in intensifying the economic development of the region.

As a metropolitan area, it shall be the center of development where government services, trade, finance, logistics, and social services are enhanced and harnessed to its full potential and paved the way for a more competitive region that is connected to other metropolitan cities in Mindanao.

## Overall BARMM Spatial Strategy, Functional Roles, and Growth Centers

The BARMM shall adopt a multi-nodal overall spatial strategy that consists of primary growth centers and secondary growth centers across the region. The six provinces, Cotabato City, and the SGA shall be the development nodes, and the growth centers are the areas from where the development emanates and radiates all over the region.

While there is an equitable support for the development of these areas in the multi-nodal approach, the level of development may vary among the different nodes. The eventual result in the long-term physical development of the eight nodes shall be the Corridor of New Economies (CONE) that is anchored on the functional roles.

Functional roles were determined by assessing the comparative advantages and potentials of the provinces. These functional roles, once developed, shall stimulate the growth the new economies and thereby help boost the region's economy.

### Cotabato City as the regional financial and commercial hub

Cotabato City is the Central Business District (CBD) of BARMM. It serves as commercial, industrial, financial, educational, and the current regional seat of the Bangsamoro government because of its strategic location in Central Mindanao that links to the cities of Davao, Cagayan de Oro, Zamboanga, and General Santos. It is also the strategic area for assemblies, conventions, meetings, and other events. One of the tourist destinations in Cotabato City is the Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mosque, known as the "Grand Mosque", the second largest mosque in the Philippines with an estimated capacity of 15,000 people. The Cotabato Regional and Medical Center (CRMC) in Cotabato City serves as center for health and wellness. The presence of banks, business establishments such as restaurants, gasoline stations, pawnshops, lending institutions and other financial and commercial centers sets Cotabato City as the region's financial and commercial hub.

### Maguindanao del Norte as transshipment point, economic zone and eco-tourism loop

Maguindanao del Norte is composed of 12 municipalities under one legislative district. Its capital municipality is Datu Odin Sinsuat which is home to famous attractions such as Mount Minandar, Blue Lagoon, and Kusiong beaches. The Hashim Salamat Highway connecting the Barira-Butig road once completed will trigger the development of the area, and the promotion of its cultural heritage and preservation and conservation of its ecological integrity. The Polloc Freeport and Ecozone situated in Parang, Maguindanao is one of its twin primary growth centers. Sea transport connectivity will be revitalized through the Cotabato City to Bongo Island ferry route and the Polloc to Basilan roro route.

Aside from the beaches and tourism spots, the province has the potential in international market as one of the suppliers of agricultural products like banana produced in the municipality of Matanog.

With their proximity to Cotabato City, the municipalities of Datu Odin Sinsuat and Sultan Kudarat also serve as residential and settlements sites.

The municipality of Upi is the major producer of corn crops in the province. It celebrates Meguyaya Festival, an annual celebration of the Teduray's merrymaking and thanksgiving for bountiful harvest every December.

### Maguindanao del Sur as agri-business ventures and conservation area

Maguindanao del Sur is comprised of 24 municipalities under one legislative district. By virtue of RA 11550, also known as the "Charter of the Provinces of the Maguindanao del Sur and Maguindanao del Norte" dated May 27, 2021, Buluan is identified as the capital and seat of government of the province. The municipalities of Buluan and Shariff Aguak are the twin primary growth centers, while General Salipada K. Pendatun serves as the secondary growth center in the province.

The Lake Buluan and Ligawasan Marsh are among the protected areas in the province. Lake Buluan was proclaimed as Natural Area on December 1, 1926 through Presidential Proclamation No. 59. Under Fisheries Administrative Order (FAO) No. 19 issued on January 1941, approximately 44,000 hectares of Ligawasan Marsh were declared as Game Refuge and Birds Sanctuary. Many waterbird species including herons, egret, rails, shorebirds, and ducks are found in areas of the marsh. Also, it has large reserves of oil and natural gas that are potential for investments.

Abundant production of agricultural crops like palay, corn, banana, and palm oil contribute to the robust agri-business activities such as palm oil processing, chicken dressing plant, fresh water dried fish (pangus), among others.

### SGA as center for living tradition

The SGA comprises the 63 barangays from the province of North Cotabato, pursuant to RA 11054. Under EO No.1 series of 2020 issued by the Office of the Chief Minister "Establishing the Development Coordinating Office", the SGA is composed of eight clusters namely: Carmen, Kabacan, Midsayap I, Midsayap II, Pigcawayan, Pikit I, Pikit II, and Pikit III.

SGA is known for its Moro traditional products and local delicacies. It is envisioned as the supplier of BARMM Pasalubong Centers. Midsayap showcases their gifts and handicrafts industry from decorative crafts to woven traditional textiles such as inaul, tubao, and malong. Furnitures, ceramic, nipa, and likos-making are also remarkable in most areas of SGA as one of their economic potentials.

Aside from their local products and delicacies, the existence of traditional and cultural music also gives significance in enriching Moro culture. The famous music of Kulintang, a gong-chime instrument played by a pair of wooden sticks, is widely used for celebratory occasions such as festivals, weddings, as well as musical competition. Other instruments include dabakan, babandil, gandingan, and agong. Certain musical families in the province specialize in these skills and pass down these traditions and practices from generation to generation.

Pikit, the special secondary growth center, is famous for their Maguindanaon delicacies including tinagtag, panyalam, kumukunsi, and dudol.

SGA also has its own potentials for agro-fishery industry. Kabacan, Pikit, Carmen, and Pigcawayan are the major producers of rice, corn, coconut, palm oil, cassava, sugarcane, banana, coffee, carp, and mudfish. Goat raising and fish processing are also significant in boosting their economy.

## Vulnerability Reduction

Vulnerability reduction is a principle of spatial strategy that includes the security and protection of agglomerated and connected infrastructure against threats from man-made and natural disasters. It considers the climate change projections and threats of hydrometeorological and geologic hazard, and other events including public health emergencies with increasing initiatives on disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation.

### Hydrometeorological Hazards

The BARMM has become more susceptible to climate change and disasters. This is reflected in their high exposure and vulnerability to floods and droughts. Natural disasters have become more frequent and damaging. Therefore, typhoons and droughts caused displacement, loss of livelihood, disruption of agricultural activities, and food insecurity.

Frequent flooding in low-lying areas, especially in Cotabato City, Maguindanao, and Lanao del Sur, is caused by persistent rainfall in the BARMM and Northern Mindanao that affects large numbers of communities in the region. In addition, BARMM is affected by storm surges particularly in Maguindanao, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi.

Recently, the diminishing area of forest cover, rain-induced landslides, and soil erosions are experienced in the provinces of Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Basilan, and Sulu.

### Geological Hazards

There are two trenches that engulf the region causing the occurrence of earthquakes and tsunamis. Epicenters are located around faults and trenches. Sulu Trench is on the west side of the island provinces of the region and the Cotabato Trench is located in the southwestern coast of the mainland area of the region.

### Volcanic Hazards

The region has two dormant stratovolcanoes, namely, Mt. Ragang and Mt. Makaturing. Both are located in the province of Lanao del Sur. The Mt. Ragang is the 7th highest volcano in the country and recorded its last eruption in 1916 while Mt. Makaturing erupted in 1882.
