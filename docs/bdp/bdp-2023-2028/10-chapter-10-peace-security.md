# Chapter 10: Enhancing and strengthening the peace, public order, safety, and security, and upholding human rights for peaceful, safe, and resilient Bangsamoro communities

The BOL stipulates provisions about transitional justice, Indigenous People's rights, and human rights; roles of the different law enforcement and security agencies; the importance of DRR-CCA; the role of the national government and Bangsamoro government in the normalization process; among others.

This chapter covers four sub-sectors, namely, peace and security, public order and safety, peacebuilding, and human rights.

This chapter supports both SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals and SDG 16 — Peace, justice, and strong institutions. Support for the eighth point of President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.'s Eight Point Socioeconomic Agenda, "Uphold Public Order and Safety, Peace and Security," is likewise supported by this.

Further, this chapter supports the enhanced 12-Point Priority Agenda of the BARMM particularly Agenda 8 which aims to build the resilience of Bangsamoro communities from human-induced and natural disasters including emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, and adaptive capacities to climate change by pursuing a holistic approach to disaster prevention and mitigation, preparedness, response, recovery, and rehabilitation; Agenda 10 which aims to provide meaningful and IDP-centered support to the ongoing rehabilitation, reconstruction, and recovery of Marawi City; and Agenda 11 that aims to sustain and improve peace, justice, and security across the BARMM through strong coordination and proactive collaboration with law enforcement agencies, development partners, and other relevant agencies and stakeholders.

Overall, this chapter discusses the BARMM's continual challenges to peace and order, security and threats, public safety, and human rights violations, as well as the specific interventions of the Bangsamoro government to address these interminable issues.

## Sectoral Assessment

The Bangsamoro government has been working on sustaining the gains of the peace process and improving the security of the Bangsamoro. It continues to increase and develop the resiliency of its constituents against natural calamities, human-induced disasters, and pandemics. Further, it ensures the protection and promotion of human rights and continues conflict-sensitive and peace-promoting initiatives for progressive and sustainable development in Bangsamoro.

In achieving lasting peace, the Bangsamoro government has accomplished a lot of things in the past three years. Several programs, projects, activities, and policies were implemented in ensuring peace and security in the region, it has also intensified peacebuilding efforts work. However, there is a lot of work that needs to be done for the Bangsamoro government to maintain public order and safety, and respect for human rights.

### Sectoral Trends

#### Peace and Security

**Sustaining the gains of the peace process.** After the ratification of RA 11054, also known as the BOL in 2019, there was a significant decline in the frequency and intensity of violence in the region. The three-year transition, 2020 to 2022, has been extended by RA 11593, giving the BTA the extension by resetting the BTA election in 2025. It provides enough time for the existing BTA to accomplish the critical plans that were laid down for Bangsamoro in sustaining the gains from the peace agreement over the last years.

**73 cleared barangays in Local Terrorist Group (LTG) Areas.** Even with the extension of BTA, the threat brought by extremist groups continues in some areas of BARMM. Also, some local insurgents still threaten the stability of the peace and order in the provinces of Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Basilan, and Sulu.

The challenges posed by the lingering idea of terrorism and violent extremism remain among the major concerns for peace and order, and security in the region. Skirmishes between security forces and LTGs, though in a continuing decline since 2018, have been recorded for the past five years. Violent extremists operating in the region still can terrorize the public through bombing and extortion.

Despite the threats from the LTGs, the security sector has been working on addressing this concern. As of May 2021, there are 73 cleared barangays in LTG Areas as recommended by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).

**Table 10.1 Number of Cleared Barangays in Local Terrorist Group Areas, 2021**

| Province | Number of Barangay |
|----------|-------------------|
| Lanao del Sur | 11 |
| Maguindanao | 16 |
| Sulu | 4 |
| Basilan | 42 |
| **Total** | **73** |

**Manageable peace and order situation.** The threat brought by extremist groups affects the tranquility and economic stability of the region. The PRO-BAR uses a four-level threat advisory system that assesses the possibility of terror attacks from threat groups. As of October 2021, there are 22 municipalities under high threat terrorism levels while 12 municipalities are under moderate threat levels of terrorism. Despite this, the peace and order situation in the region is manageable through the efforts of the security sector and law enforcement agencies proactive measures.

**Table 10.2 Level of Terrorism Threat, by Province, 2021**

| Province | High | Moderate |
|----------|------|----------|
| Lanao del Sur | 5 | 2 |
| Maguindanao | 13 | 6 |
| Sulu | 3 | 1 |
| Basilan | 1 | 3 |
| Tawi-Tawi | 0 | 0 |
| **Total** | **22** | **12** |

**Presence of AFP, MILF camps, and the presence of Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) stations in strategic areas of BARMM.** BARMM was also strengthened by the activation of the Joint Peace and Security Team (JPST)- tri-forces composed of elements of AFP, Philippine National Police (PNP), and MILF- Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces (MILF-BIAF) which helped in the maintenance of peace, public order, and stability of mutually agreed areas in BARMM and other conflict-affected areas in Mindanao.

**Active private armed groups (PAGs) reduced.** The PRO-BAR recorded a total of 18 PAGs operating in the Bangsamoro region. As of 2021, PAGs are reduced to one through delisting due to inactivity, delisting through voluntary surrender, and delisting through law enforcement operations.

**No crew abductions within Bangsamoro waters.** The PCG reported zero maritime abductions in 2021, compared to five (Indonesian) in 2020 and 22 (Filipinos, Vietnamese, and Indonesians) abductions from 2016 to 2017, showing a gradual decrease in numbers. These maritime incidents pertain to crew abductions from ships for ransom that have been prevalent along the waters of Sulu - Celebes Seas, which also falls under the BARMM. The PCG, in line with its mandate in cooperation and collaboration with its partner agencies, AFP and PNP, and the support of the local government of Sibutu, Tawi-Tawi has contributed to the said decrease.

Furthermore, the PCG established a radar station at Sibutu, Tawi-Tawi that safely monitors 19,563 vessels going North and South in 2021 and 6,694 vessels from January to May 2022 alone. It also implemented the Department of Transportation (DOTr) MC 2017-001 Safety, Security, and Environmental Numbering System for all Philippine vessels with the support of the LGUs of the BARMM.

**29 lupon members and barangay officials awarded with LTIA.** The Bangsamoro government recognizes local officials who have exerted exemplary efforts in governance and leadership, contributing to the promotion of moral governance and peace sustainability. In 2020, there were 29 lupon members and barangay officials awarded with LTIA.

#### Public Order and Safety

**A breakthrough in rido settlement but family feud remains implacable during the BARMM transition period.** In 2021, the Ministry of Public Order and Safety (MPOS) made a breakthrough by successfully resolving a three-decade long rido or family feud between two prominent families in the province of Lanao del Sur. In the record of MPOS, the highest number of rido cases is recorded in Lanao del Sur with a total of 332 cases. The BARMM has profiled a total of 552 cases, with 272 settled between 2019 to 2021.

**Table 10.3 Profiled Rido Cases in BARMM, by Province/City, 2022**

| Province | Number of Cases |
|----------|-----------------|
| Lanao del Sur | 332 |
| Maguindanao | 95 |

**The Regional Crime Index of BARMM reduced by more than 42 percent in 2021 compared to 2017.** The PNP reported in 2017 a total of 1,676 index crimes in the BARMM covering the five provinces and Cotabato City. Data shows that there was a significant and consistent decrease in crime index in each succeeding annual period. By the end of 2021, a total of 710 crime indexes were reported which was 42 percent less than 2017.

**High crime solution efficiency rate despite the high demand for additional police forces.** The increased number of deployed police forces in the BARMM was considered one of the huge contributory factors towards the said achievement. In 2017, there was 6,703 total police personnel deployed in different areas of Bangsamoro. However, when compared to the national standard ratio, the Bangsamoro region's demand for additional police forces remains high.

**Table 10.5 Police Force, National vs. BARMM, 2017-2022**

| | Standard Ratio | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |
|---|----------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| National Police Office | 1:500 | 1:489 | 1:505 | 1:572 | 1:506 | 1:572 | 1:489 |
| BARMM | 1:500 | 1:532 | 1:516 | 1:507 | 1:553 | 1:566 | 1:574 |

Nonetheless, the increasing efficiency rate of 51.74 percent in 2017 to 69.50 percent in 2019 shows the effectiveness of PRO-BAR in solving criminalities in the Bangsamoro region. This is a result of the incessant and strong collaboration of law enforcers and the Bangsamoro government together with its constituent Bangsamoro communities. The augmentation provided by the current government of the day strengthened the operational capacity of the LEAs which made them operationally more visible and responsive. Moreover, the whole-of-nation approach adopted by the AFP and the various LEAs in fighting criminalities was also instrumental in the achievement of this goal.

**Table 10.6 Crime Volume, Crime Rate, and Crime Solution Efficiency, by Provinces, 2017-2020**

| Indicator | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |

**Increase in drug-cleared barangays in the region.** The Barangay Drug Clearing Program (BDCP) seeks to lessen the number of barangays that are adversely affected by drugs in the nation by removing drugs from users, removing the allure of illegal drugs, and reducing the effects of the drug problem in the community by enlisting the assistance of all relevant parties and duty bearers.

The BDCP implementation involves the harmonized efforts of the national and local government units in Bangsamoro, as well as of LEAs mandated to implement the anti-drug law in coordination with the Anti-Drug Abuse Council (ADAC) in their respective areas of responsibility. The series of processes involved in the implementation of the program such as the reformation of drug personalities identified by the joint efforts of every Barangay Anti-Drug Abuse Council (BADAC), PNP, AFP, and other law enforcement units, provide considerable contributions to the success of the program. Regardless, other internal hindering factors in the implementation of the program such as the involvement of high-value drug personalities (validation, verification, and adjudication is a very time-consuming process), and the emergence of newly identified drug offenders and surrenderers resulted in the reversion of the status of declared drug-cleared/drug-free barangays to drug-affected barangays during the period covered. This prevents the sustainability of the program in some barangays, thus reducing their efficiency in complying with the requirements of the BDCP.

As of May 2022, out of the 2,590 total barangays in BARMM (with the inclusion of the 63 barangays of the SGA) 1,955 barangays were identified as drug-affected barangays upon the implementation of the BDCP in CY 2017. The Regional Oversight Committee also declared 867 drug-affected barangays as drug-cleared barangays as of May 2022. A total of 1,088 barangays remains under the category of drug-affected barangay. Further, 174 unaffected barangays were certified as drug-free or unaffected barangay by the Regional Oversight Committee and 461 barangays are still to be certified as drug-free or unaffected barangays.

The significant increase in the number of drug-cleared barangays during the period covered can be attributed to the willingness of the LGUs in Bangsamoro region to implement the program. However, due to some other factors such as geographical location, environmental accessibility to deliver the program, and other sociological considerations in the island provinces, the implementation of the BDCP in BaSulTa is considerably behind as compared to the current status of the provinces of Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur.

**Table 10.7 Drug-Cleared/Free Barangay, by Province/City, as of May 2022**

| City/Province | Number of Barangays | Drug Affected Barangays | Drug Cleared Barangay | Remaining Drug Affected Barangays | Certified Unaffected Barangay | Remaining Unaffected Brgy. to be Certified |

**Enhancement of fire safety enforcement of the establishments in BARMM.** From 2017 to 2020, there was an increase in the number of fire-related incidents. Despite this, BFP-BARMM has inspected 63,263 establishments since 2017. There was an increase in the number of establishments adhering to fire safety requirements. This can be seen in the number of inspected establishments in the Bangsamoro which has notably escalated from 9,777 in 2017 to 16,874 in 2021 or a rate of 172.6 percent in four-year time, particularly higher in Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur.

**Figure 10.1 Number of Fire-Related Incidents, by Province, 2017-2021**

*[Bar Chart showing fire-related incidents by province (Basilan, Cotabato, Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi) from 2017-2021]*

*Source: BFP-BARMM*

For fire-related incidents related to human costs, Sulu recorded the highest number of killed and injured in 2021, which is 52 and 58, respectively. These can be attributed to the incident in 2021 Philippine Air Force C-130 crash in Patikul, Sulu.

The national standard requires that there should be at least one fire station in every municipality or city with adequate personnel, complete firefighting facilities, and equipment. As of 2021, there are 56 cities and municipalities with fire stations and 42 with fire trucks in the BARMM. Maguindanao has 20 fire stations and 19 fire trucks; Lanao del Sur has 19 fire stations and nine fire trucks, Sulu has seven fire stations and seven fire trucks; Basilan with five fire stations and four fire trucks, and Tawi-Tawi has the lowest number of fire stations and fire truck, with four and two, respectively.

**Decrease in the jail population.** The intensified program of Duterte's Administration against illegal drugs compels concerned LEAs to conduct 24/7 operations against violators. Hence, numerous commitment orders were issued by the competent courts directing jail stations in Maguindanao and Cotabato City Jail to accommodate arrested violators.

Further, in August 2019 there was a significant increase in the jail population. This was due to the addition of Cotabato City Jail as a result of the ARMM to BARMM transition. In 2020, there was a steady increase in the jail population, this was due to the movement and commitment restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Due to this, numerous members of BJMP-BARMM personnel were assigned to Maguindanao province and Cotabato City. These jail personnel were performing custodial, escorting, security, and paralegal duties at all jail stations of the mentioned province and city.

**Table 10.9 Custodial Service Efficiency of BJMP-BARMM, 3rd Quarter 2022**

| Facility | Jail Population | Congestion Rate (Percent) |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Cotabato CJ | 237 | 565 |

With the easing of the pandemic restrictions in 2021 and the transfer of persons deprived of liberty (PDL) from PNP detention, there was a significant increase in the jail population. From January to September 2022, intensified paralegal services on releases resulted in a decrease in the jail population. The third quarter data on congestion rate shows a decrease to 193 percent from 261 percent.

#### Peacebuilding

The gains of the peace process obtained from the peace agreement must be sustained, thus the promotion of peacebuilding initiatives is one of the priorities of the peace, public order, safety, and security sector.

**Significant accomplishments on peacebuilding towards normalization.** Supplemental to the interventions of the normalization process, peacebuilding programs cater to the former combatants, their families, and communities, as well as those who are not covered by the normalization programs.

The BARMM recorded in 2021 a remarkable accomplishment versus its target peacebuilding programs to vulnerable combatants with 180 against 50, vulnerable widows of martyrs with 47 against 30, and local insurgents with 74 against 30. Interventions comprised of organizing and capacitating former combatants who did not qualify in the decommissioning program of the national government, including the widows and orphans of martyrs left in the margins; and attracting local insurgents to return to the folds of the law and transform them into valuable resources of the Bangsamoro.

The BARMM profiled 33 MILF camps that are subscribed to the MILF Central Committee. These camps are beneficiaries, especially the members of the BIAF who are not part of the decommissioning program of the national government. Combatants who are residing in the camps, who have no sufficient means to support their families and combatants who are vulnerable or prone to be recruited by violent extremists or other lawless elements are prioritized to benefit in the peacebuilding initiatives.

**Table 10.10 Number of Base Camps, BARMM, 2022**

| Province/City | No. of Base Camp | Name of Base Camp |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Regional | 1 | 128th Base Camp |
| Maguindanao | 6 | 105th Base Camp, 106th Base Camp, 109th Base Camp, 118th Base Camp, General Headquarters, Head Quarters |
| Lanao del Sur | 12 | 101st Base Camp, 102nd Base Camp, 103rd Base Camp, 116th Base Camp, 119th Base Camp, 120th Base Camp, 121st Base Camp, 122nd Base Camp, 123rd Base Camp, 124th Base Camp, 127th Base Camp, Nat'l Guard Base Command |

**Camp Transformation Plan (CTP) 2020-2026.** One part of the normalization process is transforming the conflict-affected areas into communities that would help the residents achieve their desired quality of life, which includes the pursuit of sustainable livelihoods and political participation. The CTP 2020-2026 is formulated to implement the projects and programs that will transform the camps into productive communities. The target beneficiaries of the CTP 2020-2026 are centered on the six acknowledged MILF Camps, namely: Camp Abu Bakar, Camp Bushra, Camp Omar, Camp Rajah Muda, Camp Badr, and Camp Bilal.

**Commemoration of Bangsamoro History Month.** The promotion of peacebuilding includes the recognition of the historical events commemorated by the Bangsamoro government. The issuance of Proclamation No. 0001 of the OCM, declaring the Bangsamoro History Month every month of March, recognizes the many significant events in the history of the Bangsamoro in pursuit of peace and the right to self-determination. Among these significant events are Jabidah Massacre, Bud Dajo Massacre, Dansalan Declaration, All-Out War against MILF, Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro, and Inauguration of the BARMM and Inaugural Session of the BTA. These events warrant proper recognition, commemoration, or celebration as part of the peacebuilding effort of the Bangsamoro government.

#### Human Rights

**Decline in human rights violations.** In terms of the horizontal conflicts, land disputes and clan or family feud continue to be the major causes of grave human rights violations, including internal displacement. However, with some notable exceptions, the State, either has failed to investigate the pattern and gravity of these violations or its efforts in this regard have been insufficient. As a result, the State is remiss in its obligation to elicit the facts behind allegations of abuse, to ensure the accountability of perpetrators, and to provide reparation for the victim and survivors.

A significant decrease in human rights violations was recorded in the BARMM from 90 cases in 2019 to 38 cases in 2021. Among the BARMM provinces, Maguindanao registered the highest number of cases with 13, whereas Tawi-Tawi has 10, Lanao del Sur has six, and Basilan has four. While no case was recorded for Sulu.

**Figure 10.4 Number of Human Rights Cases Investigated, by Province, 2017-2021**

**Building blocks for transitional justice and reconciliation (TJR).** The Bangsamoro government, through the BHRC, has included in its strategic priorities efforts to better understand and articulate the role that transitional justice processes can play. The TJR process is pivotal in sustaining peace, attainment of sustainable development goals, prevention of human rights abuses or violations, and the implications of this on how such processes are conceptualized, designed, and implemented.

**Risk of gender-based violence (GBV) remains high.** A rapid assessment of GBV and child protection concerns was taken on in October 2017 by the GBV Working Group. It has been revealed that children and young women encountered an increased risk of GBV, including sexual abuse, exploitation, and Child Early and Forced Marriage (CEFM). In the GBV report, 45 percent of the conflict-affected areas reviewed have reported that girls were the most affected by sexual violence. The complex interplay of religious, cultural, political, and economic factors extends the culture of silence around the issue of GBV. Meanwhile, the fear of rejection from society deterred the survivors from telling their stories. Marrying off the victim to the perpetrator is the usual form of amicable settlement purportedly to avoid family feuds.

As documented by the BWC, there were 16 cases of VAWC reported in 2019, 18 cases in 2020, and 28 cases in 2021, with 23 involving ages 10 to 40 women and children.

The GAD-GBV remains one of the most prevalent and persistent issues facing women and girls in BARMM. Conflict and other humanitarian emergencies place women and girls at increased risk of many forms of GBV. It includes acts that inflict physical, sexual, or mental harm or suffering, which elevates to becoming a pressing public health issue. Anent to this, it also includes threats of such acts, coercion, and other deprivations of liberty, which too, can greatly affect all cultural identities and socioeconomic classes in the region.

Increasing issues on GBV continue to be a rising problem in BARMM. Most of the recorded cases across the region are denied legal assistance due to excessive poverty and geographic placement, even noting their lack of information about their rights. Most cases result in an amicable settlement because of fear, especially as a precaution against clan feuds, and the like.

As documented by the Commission, there were 16 cases of VAWC reported in 2019, 18 cases in 2020, 28 cases in 2021, and 11 cases from the first quarter of 2022. Women and children between the ages of 10 to 40 years old have reported a total of 23 cases. The reported perpetrators were either their husbands, fathers, aunts, or male neighbors. The abuses include sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, psychological violence, financial abuse, and domestic violence.

There is a steady increase in the number of reported cases which may be due to two reasons. One is that these women or young girls are now knowledgeable of the BWC's mandate and underlying services. The other reason for this includes the perpetrator's reduced fear of being penalized because said heinous acts can be settled by their community leaders with very minimal consequence which is alarming.

**Figure 10.5 Number of Reported GBV Cases, BARMM, 2019-2022**

The presented figure above only reflects GBV cases reported to the BWC and does not represent the overall reported cases in BARMM.

## Opportunities

**Strengthened linkages and partnerships with the UN, international non-government organizations (INGOs), CSOs, and grassroots groups.** The good relationship between the development partners and the Bangsamoro government is an opportunity to extend the coverage of the development in the region. The complementation of the peace and development programs widened the scope of the beneficiaries, thus, bridging the gaps between the intervention and the communities most affected by the conflicts. The available national and international capacity-building and development opportunities give advantage to BARMM. National and international organizations have been supporting the Bangsamoro region in its transition period and this support has been translated into a plethora of national and international capacity-building and development opportunities. Moreover, the support from national and international bodies strengthened the technical, administrative and management, and operational capacity of the BARMM MOAs, LEAs, and Security Sector.

**Convergence with other ministries and development partners.** The collaboration of ministries and development partners in working for different peace and development programs ensures a variety of peacebuilding efforts. This has resulted in different TWGs, committees, and partnerships working with different development partners.

**Supportive LGUs.** The LGUs have a key role in connecting different stakeholders and communities. The success of the activities of the different peace and development programs and projects would not be possible without the active participation of the LGUs. The LGUs implement different programs and projects in support of the attainment of national and regional goals toward peace and development.

**Established a network of peacebuilders and peacebuilding programs in Bangsamoro.** Government agencies, different development organizations, and CSOs have been at the forefront of the peacebuilding effort in the region. Through the years, these organizations have established a network of peacebuilders working for peace and development.

**National government programs on awards and incentives.** One of the strategies for the efficient and effective implementation of programs on peace and development is providing awards and incentives. In the region, LGUs undergo different evaluations and assessments of their programs on anti-illegal drugs and strengthening peace and order councils. National awards are given to the LGUs who performed satisfactorily.

**Strengthened GAD Focal Point Systems (GFPS) of BARMM MOAs.** GFPS is a mechanism established to ensure, advocate, guide, coordinate, and monitor the development, implementation, review, and updating of their GAD plans and GAD-related PPAs of BARMM MOAs. Gender violence in the region is still prevalent. However, with the GFPS, there is a dedicated team that ensures gender violence will be addressed.

**Active participation of Community Women, Youth, and IPs Organizations across BARMM.** Women, youth, and IPs play an important part in the peacebuilding process in their communities. These community-based organizations are instrumental in the implementation of different peace and development programs and projects for the rightful beneficiaries.

**Strengthened adaptability and broad areas of specialization of assets.** The LEAs have diverse specialized manpower, these agencies can provide all the necessary personnel in every situation and emergency. They can provide medical, structural, and even military support. Members of these agencies are composed of engineers, medical personnel, criminologist, and other professionals that are can be tapped in times of disaster, emergencies, or other needs.

**Available medium for multimedia mileage.** Peace and development in the region have been the subject discussed in the different multimedia platforms. Multimedia is used not only for the promotion of peace and development, but it is also used to communicate and reflect different updates on the topic. One example of how multimedia is used can be seen in the following Facebook live shows such as MPOS Hour, Bangsamoro Youth Hours, and Babae, Usap Tayo.

**Available program on cultural revitalization in settling disputes.** Alternative dispute resolution is one of the methods to settle or addresses disputes in the region. This system relies heavily on cultural and societal traditions, and beliefs. Several programs on cultural revitalization have helped in sustaining the system of ADR.

**Existence of the Memorandum of Agreement between LEAs and the security sector.** Different Memorandum of Agreement has been entered between the BARMM MOAs and LEAs and security sector. These agreements have helped in further strengthening the different programs and projects for peace and development in BARMM.

**Established special development fund (SDF) for the recovery and rehabilitation of the conflict-affected areas in the region, as mandated by the BOL.** Section 2, Article XIV of RA 11054 or the BOL states that the national government shall provide SDF to the Bangsamoro government for the rebuilding, rehabilitation, and development of its conflict-affected communities. The implementation of programs and projects funded under the SDF provides opportunities for the Bangsamoro government to fast-track the recovery and rehabilitation of the areas and communities affected by conflict.

## Priority Challenges to be Addressed in 2023-2028

### Peace and Security

One of the key challenges to be addressed in 2023 to 2028 under peace and security is the **presence of peace and other security threat groups (local threat groups, terrorist groups, and violent extremist groups).** This is caused by:

**Continue penetration of the recruitment force of violent extremist groups.** The problem regarding the penetration of the recruitment force of violent extremism groups persisted because of a lack of coordination by the AFP, LEAs, and LGUs in the implementation of the whole-of-nation approach to preventing and countering violent extremism. This was aggravated by insufficient personnel and equipment which resulted in insufficient monitoring, surveillance, and mobilization forces that could be used to track the recruitment hub and involve personalities involved in violent extremism and terrorism.

Another factor that contributes to the existence of violent extremism is less proper guidance of family members to their children or minors coupled with the use of social media by extremists to spread their misleading ideology that led the youth to be involved in violent extremism activities. Lack of education, income, and financial support for legal proceedings, weak law enforcement, and unfavorable sentence or judgment coupled with fear of persecution, preference of some members of the community to satisfy their needs, and grudges.

The problem was further aggravated by a weak recruitment policy and rampant nepotism which resulted in the hiring of incompetent personnel who are tasked to handle P/CVE. Unfunded and inefficient community awareness campaigns in P/CVE and lack of access to basic services contributed to continuing penetration of the recruitment force of violent extremist groups.

**Presence of Private Armed Groups (PAGs) and Lawless Armed Groups (LAGs).** The prevalence of PAGs and LAGs organized in the region pose terror to the communities of the BARMM. These groups are utilized for purposes of committing acts of violence and/or sowing fear and intimidation or any violations of the law for the advancement and protection of vested economic and/or political interests. Some of the prominent political personalities and families maintain PAGs as protector against their rivals. The LAGs conduct criminal acts that escalate across the region creating alarm and hampering economic activities in some areas in the BARMM.

**Porous borders.** The Sulu Archipelago measures approximately 6,100 kilometers from east to west, making it a formidable task for any single country to undertake extensive maritime enforcement. Hence, Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) brings Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines together to jointly patrol the Sulu-Celebes Sea. The weak implementation of plans and programs addressing border control in the Sulu-Celebes Sea has been the hotbed for crime, piracy, and terrorism, otherwise known as the Tri-Border Area fringed by Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Islamist terrorists have exploited the porous borders to supplement conflict zones in Southeast Asia with foreign fighters.

The weak implementation of plans and programs addressing border control in the Sulu-Celebes Sea has been the hotbed for crime, piracy, and terrorism, otherwise known as the Tri-Border Area fringed by Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Islamist terrorists have exploited the porous borders to supplement conflict zones in Southeast Asia with foreign fighters. This problem was further aggravated by less prioritization of budget, inadequate numbers of personnel and equipment, and weak implementation of border control by LEAs and AFP.

**Low appreciation of constituents for government efforts.** The slow and inadequate delivery of basic services especially in GIDAs caused by an inadequate number of personnel, equipment, and facilities coupled with untimely to un-responded societal concerns has resulted in a low appreciation of constituents to the government's efforts in P/CVE.

### Public Order and Safety

A core problem that needs to be addressed in 2023 to 2028 under public order and safety is the **Prevalence of public order and safety concerns.** This is mainly caused by:

**Persistence of rido or family feuds.** As of 2022, Lanao del Sur recorded the highest rido cases of 332 out of the 552 total rido cases in the BARMM. The existence of rido is also brought by the recurrence of the previously settled feuds. Some causes of rido or family feuds are land disputes, election-related violence, rivalry for titles, misplaced maratabat or pride, major or minor crimes committed, and other civil disputes.

**Increasing crime rates, due to the proliferation of loose firearms (LFAs), cybercrime, and other illegal activities.** In 2014, Filipinos owned an estimated 3.9 million firearms and 2.1 million or half of these are illegal. In contrast, the PNP and AFP owned less than a million guns. State forces are outgunned. Shooting incidents in BARMM stood out as a common report transmitted to the Critical Events Monitoring System (CEMS) as it tallied 424 cases for 2020 or one case a day.

**Proliferation of illegal drugs.** The presence of PAGs and other LAGs being capitalized and used by some politicians and drug lords to perpetuate their political interests and greed for money, contributed to the increasing crime rates in Bangsamoro region. This situation is aggravated when drug lords become narco-politicians. The low conviction rate and the justice system in the region particularly on drug cases could be attributed to the proliferation of illegal drugs. The illegal drug involvement of narco-politicians, and gambling (both legal and illegal) potentially prevailed in the region although it cannot be identified as a major challenge.

**High fatality rates, injuries, and severe damage to properties.** Fatality rates, injuries, and the amount of property damages are increasing at an alarming rate amidst intensified prevention and mitigation programs and activities. These are brought by the inadequate awareness of the members of the community regarding public safety, and others just do not follow safety measures at all. Furthermore, the congestion of people and households in urban areas and the adverse effect of climate change also contribute to these incidents.

Violence and crime continue to be leading causes of protracted, recurring, and massive forced displacement in the region. About 17,663 families or 88,315 individuals were displaced in 2017 from Marawi, the rest of Lanao del Sur, and other places in the region due to armed conflicts, crime, and violence, and have not been able to return to their places of origin. Of the seven reported cases of forced displacement in BARMM for the month of August 2022, six are human-induced: clan/family feuds, an armed confrontation, and a drug raid. Only one was due to a natural disaster.

### Peacebuilding

A core problem that needs to be addressed under this sub-sector within 2023 to 2028 is the **Volatile peace conditions in the region.** This is associated with the following:

**Unsatisfactory implementation of peace agreements particularly on the normalization track.** One of the important aspects of the peace process is the Normalization track that includes the decommissioning of MILF combatants. Undeniably, the said combatants have played vital roles in the quest of the Bangsamoro people for the right to self-determination which resulted in the establishment of the BARMM. Unfortunately, the decommissioning process has been mired by several challenges, including the ambiguity of the source of the decommissioning package and the slow pace of the process itself, among others. So far, only the cash component amounting to One Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php100,000.00) has been received by those who have already been decommissioned. Many of those combatants have yet to be decommissioned. Moreover, not all MILF combatants are included in the list of those to be decommissioned. Meaning, even assuming that the decommissioning process is completed, there will be numerous combatants who would not be decommissioned. Further, there is rampant misinformation on the decommissioning process and perceived little impact of the implementation of programs in their respective communities.

These problems pose a serious threat not only to the success of the peace process but also to the safety and security of the people of the region. There are several reports to the effect that some disgruntled combatants have already joined, or are in the process of joining, violent extremist groups such as Maute-ISIS and BIFF. On the other hand, some combatants expressed their desire to stay in camps or the forests either due to their exclusion from the normalization or due to their dissatisfaction with how the peace process itself is working.

In this respect, it is worthy to emphasize that the Bangsamoro people have been undergoing protracted peace processes from the MNLF to the MILF - from 1975 to the present to be exact, or for almost 50 years. Although a lot of positive gains have been so far achieved, there are perceived lapses in the process of implementation. For this reason, it is not unlikely that some peace spoilers or dissatisfied individuals or groups might exploit the negative consequences of the delay and unsatisfactory implementation of the peace agreements to advance their personal, ideological, or political agenda. Hence, meaningful programs for former combatants, including peacebuilding training and capacity development, should be among the priorities of the Bangsamoro government.

**Neglect of marginalized and vulnerable sectors and institutions.** There are several groups, institutions, and individuals calling for programs or interventions for marginalized and vulnerable sectors as an effective means of P/CVE. However, the terms 'marginalized' and 'vulnerable' seem to have become overused to refer to almost all sectors, such as women, youth, elderly, poor, widows, and disabled, among others. Consequently, the factual marginalized and vulnerable sectors, such as widows and orphans of rebels or violent extremists, among others, have been overlooked in P/CVE interventions. It must be emphasized in this respect that several orphans of violent extremists have also become members of violent extremist groups as in the case of the "Ajang-ajang" in Sulu who are children of slain Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) members.

On the other hand, it has been claimed that some Madrasahs or Islamic schools were made breeding or recruitment grounds by violent extremist groups. This allegation has created reactions from the Muslim communities. Whether this claim is true or not, there is a need to address the gap concerning these institutions, such as the inadequacy of support, if any, coming from the government. To give an example, there are Asatidz or religious teachers who are teaching in Madrasahs every Saturday and Sunday but receive only a meager amount of money (Php500.00 to Php3,000.00 a month) even though most of them have graduated from Islamic schools locally or abroad.

Another is the case of active Madrasahs with dilapidated buildings and no basic facilities and equipment such as tables, chairs, and black/white boards. Cases like these are very common in remote areas and if you compare these Madrasahs to typical schools, you will easily recognize the discrepancy in the support they are receiving from the government. For instance, there are several vacant school buildings in different areas of the region. There are also places where a school building is used as Madrasah on Fridays and Saturdays. In terms of marginalization and vulnerability to violent extremism, therefore, these sectors and institutions could be at the top of the list due to their neglected conditions.

**Inadequacy and poor implementation of programs for returning local insurgents or violent extremists and their dependents.** For several decades, the Bangsamoro homeland has been devastated by terrorism or violent extremism. For instance, the island provinces of Basilan and Sulu had experienced their darkest moments in the past during the reign of terror of the ASG.

News of kidnappings and beheadings were usually dominating local and international print and broadcast media and other communication channels. Also, some Philippine Presidents attempted to eradicate the group but failed tremendously. Former President Joseph Estrada even uttered publicly that "pupulbusin ko kayo (I will destroy you, referring to ASG)". Unfortunately, he was ousted from his post without any significant success against the ASG.

In the case of Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur, the BIFF, Maute-ISIS, and other extremist groups continue to be a big threat to the safety and security of those areas. One example is the 2017 Marawi Siege that displaced about three hundred thousand and claimed the lives of more than one thousand individuals, among other damages. Fortunately, it has been observed that the number of surrendering ASG, BIFF, Maute-ISIS, and other violent extremists continue to increase in recent years. This influx of rebel returnees could be due to several reasons, one of which is the government's promise for livelihood, financial, and other assistance for those who will choose to return to the folds of the law. After all, studies suggest that most of those joining extremist and other lawless groups are motivated by monetary considerations.

However, several former local insurgents expressed their disappointment with how the programs for them are being implemented. For instance, they are claiming that what was promised to them, such as housing, livelihood, and other assistance has not been received by them until now leaving them still poor, marginalized, and neglected. Worse, they could not easily reintegrate into mainstream society and resume a peaceful life due to the stigma of being a former member of violent extremist groups.

For this reason, several reports suggesting that some of them returned to being members of such groups. It is for this reason that peacebuilding interventions to sustain the influx of surrendering violent extremists and provide sustainable programs for them and their dependents become imperative if only to establish an enduring peace in the region.

**Inadequacy of peacebuilding interventions to address factors contributing to volatile peace and security in BARMM.** The peace and security condition of BARMM, although improving in recent years as a result mainly of the peace process, has remained unstable and unpredictable. Several factors are contributing to this condition such as the perceived culture of violence, religious intolerance, tribalism, maratabat, and other negative practices or culture.

On the other hand, the absence of positive peace in most areas of the region aggravates the situation. For instance, disrespect for human dignity and values; lack of equal access to resources, services, and opportunities for government positions; extreme poverty; and poor governance, among others, are prevalent in the different areas of the region. These problems continue to hamper any effort for lasting peace and development in the region, thus, must be addressed accordingly.

**Continued displacement of Most Affected Area (MAA) residents of Marawi City.** The MRP is yet to be completed. Many of the MAA residents have not been able to return to their area due to different factors such as lack of housing and rehabilitation in Marawi City. The IDPs of the Marawi siege have been uprooted from their home since 2017, the longest IDPs being displaced.

### Human Rights

The core problem under this sub-sector is the **rampant human rights violation.** This problem is caused by:

**Low knowledge, skills, and attitude on human rights among primary duty bearers.** Central to the idea of human rights is establishing and sustaining the relationship between the rights-holder and the duty-bearer. The duty-bearers have the obligation and responsibility to protect, promote, and fulfill human rights. However, their capacity to uphold human rights is hindered due to a lack of human rights knowledge, skills, attitude, and awareness.

The lack of awareness among corrections officers in some jail detention facilities in BARMM, for instance, denies the PDLs of their rights such as proper nutrition and a healthy lifestyle, in addition to being held in overcrowded cells. According to BJMP-BARMM, these difficulties are mainly because of the lack of financial resources to implement and comply with human rights enshrined in local and international laws and standards.

**Limited access to the justice system.** Another challenge is limited access to the justice system. At the outset, while peacekeeping institutions and human rights agencies are present, this limited access to the justice system is due largely to the existence of the culture of silence at the community level. Despite the prevalence of human rights issues, people do not report them to the institutions and/or agencies concerned, making it difficult for human rights institutions such as the BHRC to address them. According to the results of an IDP Forum, displaced individuals whose human rights have been transgressed may be aware of justice mechanisms but are unsure of the extent of support to the reported cases.

Perhaps this limited access to the justice system is also due to the people's preconceived notion of the selective justice system in the country. Many people, especially the Bangsamoro people, are under the impression that justice is only for the rich. However, what they fail to see is that there is already a Bangsamoro government that takes care of them. There are already ministries, offices, and agencies that render services that they can avail of in times of need. The BHRC, for instance, has a program on financial and legal assistance to the victims of human rights violations and abuses, as well as their families which the people can avail of. Nevertheless, there are still so many communities within BARMM that are suffering from poverty. Hence, the Bangsamoro government still has a lot of work to do to address this concern.

**Insufficient awareness of human rights.** One of the challenges and reasons why human rights cases remain an issue in our communities is because there is a lack of sufficient human rights awareness on the part of the people at large. While ignorance may be bliss, it is not the case concerning human rights. The more there is a lack of awareness, the more the tendency for human rights violations to exist. On the positive note, to develop a human right conscious Bangsamoro society, where people are more aware of their rights, can mitigate cases of human rights abuses and violations, and those who are likely to violate these inherent rights would be more prudent and inclined not to do so since people are already empowered.

Moreover, if there is sufficient awareness of human rights, more resources will be supported to implement human rights advocacies, programs, projects, and activities. The lack of access to basic education, poverty, weak access to social services especially in far-flung areas, and many others, will be addressed.

Also, the lack of human rights desks at the barangay level contributes largely to this challenge. If human rights desks are placed within the reach of the people in their respective communities, the reporting of human rights cases and/or issues will be easily facilitated and provided with solutions. Consequently, it would then be easier for human rights institutions to penetrate these communities and conduct advocacies, programs, projects, and activities intended to make people aware of their basic rights.

The weak access to social services, especially in GIDA, deprived the constituents of sufficient awareness of human rights due to excessive poverty and geographic placement, even noting their lack of information about their rights.

The Bangsamoro region is experiencing an increasing number of situations where women's rights are being violated due to a lack of gender perspective in justice, security, and peace. Violence against women, human trafficking, and rape, among others, are some of the occurrences monitored by the BWC and BHRC, two agencies that are champions of upholding their rights and eliminating all forms of violation and discrimination. Furthermore, other apparent cases recorded, such as GBV and child early and forced marriages, are due to poverty.

The insufficient participation of women in armed conflict security, peace, and development process is among the contributory factors to the insufficient awareness of human rights in terms of inclusion of women, youth, and children concerned with security, peace, and development.

**Coordination with Law Enforcement Agency in the Region (CLEAR).** The program will facilitate in enforcing support to the LEAs to improve security measures through the provision of logistic support such as communication support, checkpoints operation equipment, and other COVID-19 pandemic-related assistance. Regular coordinative meetings will be employed also to facilitate a unified reporting system on peace, and public order issues in the region.

This program is composed of four subprograms which are the Coordination Mechanisms with Law Enforcement Agencies, Bangsamoro Public Order and Safety Conference, Assistance to Law Enforcement Agencies, and Training for Law Enforcement Agencies.

**Bangsamoro Community Policing.** This program will intensify relationship between and among the Bangsamoro Government, LEAs, LGUs, and other stakeholders in implementing laws, policies, and programs on public order and safety operations through synergy of efforts and plans in ensuring public order and safety in the Bangsamoro. The projects under this program are Strengthening Local Peace and Order Council (LPOC), Proficiency and Skills Enhancement for Barangay Tanods, People's Law Enforcement Board, and Capability Enhancement for Law Enforcement Agencies.

**Alternative Dispute Resolution Program.** This program seeks to address rido being one of the main impediments to achieving sustainable peace and advancement of the region. It aims to enable a mechanism and stakeholders like local mediators and concerned agencies to effectively implement their rido settlement efforts, conduct research and studies on improving rido settlement in the region, engage in the reduction or settlement of existing rido, and implement programs for the rehabilitation of rido-stricken communities.

Under this program are five sub-programs, namely: Rido Knowledge Management; Interventions for Local Mediators; Rido Settlement; Kambalingan: A rehabilitation Program for Rido-affected Communities; and Support to Institutionalization of Alternative Dispute Resolution in BARMM.

**SAFE BARMM Program.** This program seeks to gather information affecting public order and safety in the region through data gathering and consultations with partner CSOs. This also aims to establish an Early Warning and Early Response (EWER) mechanism to address public order and safety issues in the region. Further, it also aims to provide updated and reliable data and information on public order and safety to proper authorities to help them in planning and formulating effective responses.

The projects under this program are Community-Driven Safety and Security; Mashuawara Kalilintad Project; and Conflict Data Management System.

**Intensification of Law Enforcement Operation.** This program intends to operationalize the strategy to intensify advocacy campaigns against criminalities (i.e., index and non-index crime, cybercrimes, and other illegal activities), and illegal drugs. This includes activities such as Strategic Conduct of Checkpoints, Information Drive and Caravan on Loose Firearms, and Search Warrant Implementation.

**Development Support for Law Enforcement Agencies.** This program will operationalize the provision of support to enhance the capability of LEAs operating in BARMM through formulating effective mechanisms, building strong partnership, and provision of support facilities.

#### Peacebuilding

**Peacebuilding Initiatives Program.** The Peace Building Initiatives program will ensure to foster the different peace initiatives of the ministry in the region that includes sustaining the journey to peace, support to normalization, and different religious dialogue that will help assist the former combatants, widows of violent extremists, and martyrs and other local insurgents. Further, dialogue between and amongst different religious groups will foster support the gains of peace. Furthermore, through its Bangsamoro Peace Institute, it will help train and produce peace champions in the region.

The projects within this program are Peace Building Toward Normalization; Sustaining Journey to Peace; Community Peacebuilding and Development Program; Social Transformation Program; Bahay Kapayapaan Program: Assistance to the Displaced in Rido Affected Communities; Balik-Barangay Program; and Community Peacebuilding Advocacy Program.

**Popularization of Bangsamoro Historical Events (PBHE) Program.** This program banks on the idea that TJR is an integral part of post-conflict peacebuilding. The need to revisit the history of the Bangsamoro struggle through learning sessions and study tours, conversations with the victims of massacres, and conduct of commemorative activities, will greatly contribute to finding lasting peace in the Bangsamoro, especially in avoiding the recurrence of similar injustices.

Under this program are the projects namely observance of Bangsamoro History Month; Commemoration of other Historical Events; Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Promotion; and Compendium of Bangsamoro Historical Events.

**Sustaining Journey to Peace.** The objectives of this program are manifold. One, it is intended to augment the normalization efforts of the national government and the Bangsamoro government. Second, it seeks to sustain the gains of the peace process through the conduct of peacebuilding activities that would effectively hamper the efforts of violent extremists toward radicalizing the young people by exploiting the unpredictable socio-economic, political, and peace and order conditions in the region. Third, the program also aims to foster unity, understanding, and peaceful co-existence of all the peoples of the region as prerequisites for a progressive and peaceful Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

**Women Peace and Security (WPS).** This program intends to operationalize the strategies such as intensifying meaningful participation of former combatants, the vulnerable, and the marginalized sector to promote a peaceful society through dialogues and community engagement.

Under this program is the sub-program entitled Women Empowerment for Community Resilience (WECoRe) which involves the Strengthening Women Awareness Project; and the project entitled Integration of Gender in Women, Peace, and Security projects.

**Bangsamoro Youth Peace and Security Program.** The Bangsamoro Action Plan on Youth Peace and Security (BAP-YPS) has the goal of "Empowered Bangsamoro youth towards holistic and sustainable peace and development anchored in Moral Governance." The action points and the implementation of its specific targets shall serve as the building blocks of the BAP-YPS, ultimately aiming to achieve this goal. It highlights the participation of youth in peace processes, policy development, governance, capacity development, and mainstreaming of GAD. Interventions on community resilience, socioeconomic, and strategic programs shall be implemented through the lens of the culture of peace of empowered youth and religious youth leaders of the Bangsamoro.
