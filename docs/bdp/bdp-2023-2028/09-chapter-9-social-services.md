# Chapter 9: Ensuring inclusive and equitable access to quality services for social justice and human capital development

Section 19, Article XII of RA 11054 provides, among others, that the Parliament shall assign the highest budgetary priority to education, health, and social services as may be provided in its appropriation law.

This chapter covers the social development sector that includes the subsectors of education, health, nutrition and sanitation, and social welfare, giving emphasis of the agenda numbers 7 and 9 of the Enhanced 12-Point Priority Agenda of the BARMM.

This chapter aims to contribute to Agenda No. 2 of the 8-Point Socioeconomic Agenda of the Marcos Administration, and SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10.

This explains the current situation of the social sector and its subsectors, opportunities, and priority challenges. The sectoral framework underscores the desired goal and objectives provided to help achieve the region's overall goal. Corresponding strategies supported by priority intervention are identified to serve as a guide within the planning period.

## Sectoral Assessment

### Sectoral Trends

The education system and structure in the BARMM is different from other regions of the country as it combines the four sectors of basic, higher, technical, and Madaris educations. Each sector has specific level and field of education and learning but all lodged to the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Educations (MBHTE) based on BAA 13 or the Administrative Code of the BARMM.

#### BARMM lags behind in basic education performance

The BARMM is ranked lowest in functional literacy rate based on 2019 data from PSA as it recorded only 71.0 percent compared to 96.5 percent of the National Capital Region (NCR). It is attributed to high dropout rate in Grades 1 to 6 in the region. For the junior and senior high or Grades 7 to 12, BARMM is ranked number 3. In terms of cohort survival rate, the BARMM is ranked the lowest having 64.75 percent compared to Region II with highest rate at 97.89 percent. For Grades 7 to 12, the BARMM is ranked as the third lowest having 56.66 percent compared to NCR with the highest rate at 92.86 percent.

Moreover, the completion rate for Grades 1 to 6, the BARMM is ranked the lowest with 63.98 percent, far from the highest region with 98.56 percent. For Grades 7 to 12, the BARMM is ranked the third lowest with 56.89 percent compared to highest region with 90.36 percent.

This can be attributed to the prevalence of poverty leaving children with no choice but to help in the family needs, and decades old armed conflict in the region causing displacement and uncertainty. Low level of education limits income-earning opportunities like landing a stable job or opening businesses, which resulted to low family income and cyclical poverty incidence. This also increases the likelihood of becoming children at risk and children in conflict with the law.

**Table 9.1 Basic Education Performance**

| Indicator | BARMM | Philippines | Highest Region Rate | Rank/Rate |
|-----------|-------|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Functional Literacy Rate | 71.6 | 91.6 | 96.5% | Lowest among regions (PSA 2019) |
| Dropout Rate for Grade 1 to Grade 7 | 8.36 | 3.76 | 0.39% | Highest among regions |
| Dropout Rate for Grade 7 to 12 | 10.14 | 6.64 | 1.65% | 3rd highest after NCR and Region V |
| Cohort Survival Rate for Grades 1 to 6 | 64.75 | 83.02 | 98.89% | Lowest among regions |
| Cohort Survival Rate for Grades 7 to 12 | 58.66 | 71.30 | 92.46% | 3rd lowest after NCR and Region V |
| Completion Rate for Grade 1 to 6 | 63.98 | 82.51 | 98.56% | Lowest among regions |
| Completion Rate for Grade 7 to 12 | 56.89 | 69.32 | 90.36% | 3rd lowest after NCR and Region V |

#### Limited education personnel and facilities remain a challenge

The standard ratio of teacher to student are 1:50 for kindergarten, 1:35 for Grades 1 to 3, and 1:40 for Grades 4 to 12. Table 9.2 shows that there is a shortage of teachers in Grades 1 to 3 and Grades 4 to 12. It is worth noting that although the data shows no problem on the ratio of teacher to pupil in Kindergarten, the issue on the deployment of teachers particularly in the far-flung barangays, coupled with the tardiness, and absenteeism of some teachers, substantially affected the quality of education in the BARMM.

According to the joint study of the World Bank and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) in 2014, the negative impact on the effectiveness and quality of education in the region can also be attributed to the widespread teacher absences and the management of the issue. In a survey conducted in Lanao del Sur, a significant 31.0 percent was confirmed as absent, which indicates a combination of the so-called "ghost teachers" reported as school personnel and actual absences.

The study further noted that the absences of teachers are prevalent in the provincial or rural schools than in the urban schools as verified with the Lanao del Sur survey but may vary across provinces. It was likewise known that male teachers (39 percent) were more likely to be absent than female teachers (30 percent). The school principal was found to have the highest absence rates.

**Table 9.2 Actual Teacher-Student Ratio from Kindergarten to Senior High School, SY 2019-2020**

| Grade Level | Standard | Actual Teacher-Student Ratio |
|-------------|----------|------------------------------|
| Kindergarten | 1:50 | 1:26 |
| Grade 1-3 | 1:35 | 1:38 |
| Grade 4-12 | 1:40 | 1:42 |

As of school year 2020-2021, the BARMM has 2,595 total number of schools with 913,456 learners, 27,885 teachers, and 28,759 classrooms. Among the school divisions, Sulu with 448 schools has the highest total number of schools with 142,413 learners, 4,006 teachers, and 4,186 classrooms. This comprises the whole province unlike Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur with two divisions each.

#### Unserved and school-less barangays in BARMM

There are about 104 unserved and underserved barangays of basic education out of the 2,590 barangays in the BARMM. With affirmative action taken by the MBHTE through its Abot Kaalaman sa Pamilyang Bangsamoro Program (AKAP Program), 106 of these barangays are now provided with early years education via Alternative Delivery Mode (ADM).

Among the barangays reached by the AKAP are the geographically isolated, marginalized, and indigenous communities of Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur and island barangays in BaSulTa. Strategies for delivering education access to the remaining school-less barangays are also being implemented through ADM and other Flexible Learning Options (FLOs). Some of the ADM learning centers are also gradually transitioning into primary public schools.

#### Inadequate assistance to Madaris Education

Unique to the Bangsamoro education system is the presence of Madaris education. It also serves as avenue of preserving beliefs, culture, and identity of the Bangsamoro. Currently, out of 1,679 existing Madaris in the BARMM, only 117 are accredited and enjoying support from the Bangsamoro government. This is due to non-fulfillment of requirements necessary for accreditation. Thus, there is a need to provide support to those not yet accredited to comply with the requirements. Still, enhancement of the existing Madaris curriculum is necessary to keep abreast with societal demands.

Part of the regulatory function of the Directorate General for Madaris Education (DGME) is to assess, monitor, and validate the operation of the madrasahs across the region. Aside from the 117 existing accredited madrasahs in BARMM, a total of 243 madrasahs were inspected and found compliant with the minimum requirement set by the MBHTE and provided with Permit to Operate.

To ensure gradual institutionalization of Madaris education, the MBHTE hired a total of 4,868 competent Asatidz (Arabic teacher) that are deployed to public schools across the region to strengthen the integration of Islamic Studies and Arabic Language (ISAL) in the basic education.

#### Low Assessment Rate in Technical Education

Private enterprises are investing in the opening of Technical-Vocational Education and Training (TVET) programs. But the same investment is slowing down in the establishment of accredited assessment centers.

Sixty percent or 15,002 people of the total 25,002 completers/graduates have undergone the National Competency Assessment, with 94 percent or 14,036 people certified as competent.

Graduating students from With Training Regulation (WTR) registered programs must complete mandatory assessments. Private Technical Vocational Institutions (TVIs) designated as assessment venues may conduct assessments in their facilities. Out of the 25,002 completers/graduates, there are 18,193 graduates who took the competency assessment tools (CATs), with 7,465 undergoing assessments for certification, registering a 41.03 percent assessment rate.

The low assessment rate can be attributed to the BARMM's limited number of competency assessment centers and the TESDA representatives who oversee the competency assessment process. The increase in plantilla positions from 71.0 percent during ARMM to 96.0 percent in 2021 is expected to address the long-standing issue of a lack of TESDA representatives during competency assessment.

#### Limited access to higher education

Currently, the Bangsamoro has only 16 State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) and 110 private Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) operating in the region. The SUCs can help the Bangsamoro in providing affordable, inclusive, and equitable access to quality higher education. However, these institutions have been established many decades before the creation of the Bangsamoro government. Hence, there is a need to upgrade these SUCs to make them competitive with other SUCs in the country.

### Health

**Health outcomes remain challenging.** The health outcomes in the Bangsamoro region are lagging behind due to limited access to quality health services. Although there has been some progress in the overall healthcare system, however, these issues remain prevalent. Among these issues were low outcome on immunization including COVID-19 vaccination and child health; insufficient support to adolescent and women's health, psychosocial and mental health; limited access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene services; low coverage of social protection and health insurance; prevalence of malnutrition and inadequate dietary intake; worsened structural and non-structural issues on human resources; results-based financing and perpetuating supply chain data and information management, and monitoring and evaluation. These issues were exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

A perpetual issue not only in BARMM, is limited access to professional health care services due to insufficient skilled health care personnel and well-equipped health facilities at the regional and local levels. This is caused by the issue of difficulty of transportation especially in the far-flung areas and worsened by the absence of clear policy guidelines on shared responsibility in the delivery of health care services. Behavioral change remains as an issue as it requires internal motivation to practice health-seeking behavior. It requires the whole community to influence someone get motivated and practice good health seeking behavior.

**Birth and death.** In the Bangsamoro region, the annual number of live births per 1,000 population declined from 20.78 percent in 2015 to 16.7 percent in 2020. Similarly, reduction in the number of deaths in the same period was also observed from 1.59 percent in 2015 to 1.2 percent in 2020.

**Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR).** MMR in Bangsamoro was lowest in 2018 at 42.35 percent within the 2015-2020 period. However, it started to increase again in 2019. In 2020, BARMM's MMR was at 73.83 percent and was able to surpass the national average of 70.66 percent. Delays in seeking medical care and limited access to health services were among the primary causes of this upward trend.

**Ratio of physicians to population.** Table 9.4 shows that there is a shortage of physicians in the BARMM, specifically in the provinces of Maguindanao, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi and the city of Marawi. In addition, difficulty of transportation and issue of peace and order in some areas hamper health personnel from delivering health care services.

**Table 9.4 Ratio of Public Physicians to Population in the BARMM, 2021**

**Ratio of public nurse to population.** In the case of public nurses, the standard ratio is 1:20,000. Based on Table 9.5, there is no shortage of public nurses in the BARMM. However, the difficulty of transportation, added with the issues of punctuality and limited support of some LGUs, hinder the delivery of health care services particularly in the far-flung areas.

In the case of midwives, the standard ratio of the public midwives to the population in the BARMM is 1:5,000. Table 9.6 shows that there is no shortage of midwives in the BARMM except in the province of Sulu and Marawi City, wherein the current actual ratio is 1:5,536 and 1:5,822 respectively, which is greater than 1:5,000 standard. However, the issues of deployment, punctuality, and difficulty of transportation hamper the delivery of health care services.

**Health care facilities.** The health care facilities in the region have significantly increased in number, but with the increasing number of population, health care facilities remain significantly below the standard ratio.

Based on the World Bank Service Availability and Readiness Assessment in 2019, the region needs to increase the Rural Health Units (RHUs) by about 50 percent to meet the national standard of one RHU per 20,000 people. The same is needed with other necessary health facilities. As of 2021, only 117 out of 2,590 barangays of BARMM have Barangay Health Stations (BHS).

**Table 9.7 Health Care Facilities of BARMM, 2021**

There is still shortage of hospital bed capacity in the BARMM. In 2021, the MOH has issued 48 license to operate (LTO) to hospitals/infirmary with a total of 1,416 bed capacity within the BARMM and one pending LTO. By provincial distribution, Basilan has three, Lanao del Sur has eight, Maguindanao has 12, Sulu has nine, Tawi-Tawi has seven, and Marawi City has 10, with a total of 48 hospitals issued with LTO. By classification, there are 15 private infirmaries and nine government infirmaries.

For level 1 hospitals, there are seven private and 18 government hospitals, respectively. On the other hand, only one hospital was classified as level 2, which is the Maguindanao Provincial Hospital. In 2020, 45 out of 49 hospitals in the BARMM are PhilHealth accredited, while the projected bed capacity needed is 4,183 beds. The region has only 1,416 beds and still needs additional 2,767.

**No clear delineation of health policy implementation.** The issue on the actual transfer of health care services to the LGUs was identified as a major hindrance in the delivery of health care services in the region. The health and nutrition services are generally under the regional government of the BARMM through MOH. This is notable in the provinces of Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi, except in the province of Basilan and the cities of Marawi and Lamitan, in which the respective provincial and city governments directly lead the implementation of health care services.

This policy issue was not fully addressed even with the passage of RA 11148, also known as the "Kalusugan at Nutrisyon ng Mag Nanay Act" and RA 11223 of Universal Health Care Law that directs the LGUs to include health and nutrition in their nutrition PPAs since its implementation did not resonate well in Bangsamoro.

According to UNICEF report, significant number of LGUs have poor health governance implementation capacity. The LCEs were found to have limited knowledge on the health and nutritional status of their community, have less commitments to their interventions on malnutrition, teenage pregnancy, and poor access to basic sanitation and safe drinking water which led to significant health issues. Most of the LGUs overlook the significant functions of health and nutrition bodies such as the Local Health Board (LHB), and Local Nutrition Committees (LNC), and the integration of health and nutrition and WaSH plans in the LGUs AIP.

**Poor maternal health care.** BARMM's prenatal, delivery, and post-natal care for women rate are inferior when compared to national averages. The 2017 NDHS recorded that 68.6 percent received antenatal care from a skilled provider, the lowest in the country. Upon birth delivery, only 33.6 percent were attended by skilled birth attendants and a very low 28.4 percent by institutional delivery. Post-natal care coverage also followed a similar path with only 63.6 percent (second lowest nationwide) of women aged 15-49 receiving post-natal checkup in the first two days following delivery.

**Sexual and reproductive health.** Access to and use of modern contraceptive methods is another area where BARMM lags behind the national prevalence rates. BARMM's contraceptive prevalence rate (any contraception method) appears to be very low at 26.3 percent for women aged 15 to 49. Naturally, a low average on use of contraception in the region heightens the risk of early pregnancy, which is closely like national trends with 1.6 percent of women already sexually active before the age of 15. There is no significant difference between the teenage pregnancy rate in BARMM and the national prevalence. The 2017 NDHS data reveals that among women aged 15-19 in BARMM, 8.5 percent have begun childbearing, a percentage slightly lower than the national average of 8.6 percent.

**Low birth weight.** It is expected that infants will be born prematurely when the mothers are malnourished or unhealthy during pregnancy or unhealthy. Poor nutrition is one of the factors that can lead to low birth weight and infants with low birth weight (LBW) are at higher risk of complications or serious health problems as they get older.

In 2015, 2.53 percent of newborn babies in Bangsamoro have low birth weights. This has further decreased to 1.49 percent in 2018 but eventually catapulted to 2.37 percent in 2019, a year just before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the region.

**Low immunization coverage.** The 2017 NDHS showed that ARMM (now BARMM) was the lowest in terms of vaccination coverage with only 18 percent of children 12-23 months received all basic vaccine or fully immunized child (FIC). Only 28.9 percent of its children 6-23 months received 3 doses of Diphtheria, Pertussis and Tetanus (DPT 3). The region has also the highest in proportion of unvaccinated children with 43.7 percent.

### Nutrition

**Malnutrition remains prevalent in BARMM.** Malnutrition in BARMM calls for immediate action. Table 9.10 shows the prevalence and magnitude of these various forms of malnutrition in BARMM in compared to the national average. BARMM is the least in the country and the ASEAN region. This comparative position of BARMM have been a worrying feature of the region as well as in the past Philippine Plan of Action for Nutrition (PPANs). The World Bank-UNICEF Report on Child Nutrition and Mothers'/Caregivers' Perception on Stunting revealed that stunting prevalence in BARMM was 39.1 percent and wasting was 10.0 percent. While wasting rates are highest during the first year of life, stunting statistically increased during the second year of life, a pattern like in the entire country.

The high co-existence of wasting and stunting (WaSt) at 3.2 percent, Tawi-Tawi at 3.6 percent, and Sulu at 5.0 percent is equal to or exceeding the 3.6 percent average for fragile and conflict affected states globally. These children, along those with severe wasting at 3.7 percent are at higher risk for severe illness and mortality. Children from the island provinces of BaSulTa had higher rates of stunting and wasting compared to BARMM's mainland areas. The prevalence cited above means for an urgency to respond to the needs of 25,200 severely wasted children 0-59 months and 21,800 children 0-59 months with the combined problem of wasting and stunting.

In addition, the World Bank-UNICEF Report recorded that the situation for pregnant and lactating women is still bleak, with 22.3 percent of pregnant women who are nutritionally-at-risk compared to 24.7 percent of the national average; and 10.4 percent of lactating women are underweight compared to 13.6 percent of the national average. On the positive side, anemia rates among pregnant and lactating women have been declining at 19.6 percent and 11.6 percent, respectively. Of equal concern is the double burden of malnutrition with steadily increasing prevalence of overweight among children.

Equally worrying is the lack of progress being made in nutrition as shown in Table 9.10 contained from data available from the UNICEF sponsored Situation Analysis of Children in BARMM, 2017, The DOST-FNRI ENNS 2018, 2021 the 2019 UNICEF World Bank Study (2019).

### Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WaSH)

**Limited access to safe drinking water.** WaSH is a main public health concern. Access to potable water and sanitary toilets remains a challenge despite the project implementation of numerous water supply facilities in the region and the abundant water resources such as lakes, rivers, springs, streams, and other untapped water resources. Limited potable water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene practices increase vulnerability to diarrhea and other infectious and water-borne diseases, which are direct causes of acute malnutrition.

**Improve access to basic sanitation facilities.** The access to basic sanitation for households in the BARMM is continuously improving. From 2015 to 2018, the proportion of households with access to basic sanitation has increased from 25.04 percent to 33.84 percent. This further increased to 34.11 percent in 2021. On the other hand, 15.94 percent of barangays in the region are certified zero open defecation and slowly emerged as the region with the worst sanitation status in the country. However, this slight improvement still leaves the region with a substantial number of households with access to better sanitation and transform sanitary practice.

**Low access to potable water.** Access to basic safe water supply in BARMM was consistently below the national average from 2016 to 2020. In 2016, 71.7 percent of households have access to potable water, but it went down to 52.71 percent in 2017. It slowly regained an increase until it reached to 61.25 percent in 2020 which is still lower than the 2016 baseline. Similarly, the FHSIS report showed that acute water diarrhea has been the leading cause of morbidity in the region since 2019.

- 2019: Philippines 72.61%, BARMM 59.5%
- 2020: Philippines -, BARMM 61.25%

**COVID-19 situation in BARMM.** The pandemic caused by COVID-19 that is still challenging the country significantly affected the problematic health care system in the BARMM. As of July 2022, the region still records a 3.50 case fatality rate (CFR) and 4.0 positivity rate, resulting to 19,852 confirmed cases with 693 total deaths.

Aside from poor access to health care facilities and services, the region has registered a low vaccination turnout at 30.55 percent as of the second quarter of 2022. This is attributed to the residents' reluctance to get the vaccine. Some of the concerns expressed include vaccines alleged deadly side effects and ineffectiveness against the coronavirus, and religious beliefs that vaccinations invalidate fasting or are not halal (permitted under Islamic law).

In January 2023, the region was only able to fully vaccinated the 60.77 percent of its population, still below the national target of 70 percent. A new directive was issued to achieve 90 percent of primary series coverage for Priority Group A2 (senior citizens) and 50 percent of the first booster coverage.

**Table 9.11 Percentage and Number of Fully Vaccinated Individuals**

| Province | % of Fully Vaccinated Individuals | No. of Fully Vaccinated Individuals |

### Population and Development

**Unmet needs of the population.** Based on the 2015 census, the BARMM's population was 4,273,149, in which it substantially increased to 4,944,800 in 2020. The region's population growth rate also went up from 2.86 percent in the previous census to 3.26 percent in 2020, which is higher compared to other regions in the country. This simply means that the BARMM has the fastest growing population. As a result, unmet needs of the population are continuously increasing as the number of population is growing faster while the delivery of services remains slow.

The figure below shows the distribution of population by age. It shows that out of the 4,944,800 population of the BARMM, 2,792,892 are working age and the rest are dependents.

### Social Welfare

The social welfare subsector covers poverty and vulnerability of the poor and marginalized sectors in the region. This includes women, children, older persons, differently-abled persons, indigenous cultural communities, internally displaced persons (IDPs), and those similarly situated by analogy that may benefit from social service interventions to protect and address their needs.

Early child care and development (ECCD) is given emphasis to ensure that the new generation of the Bangsamoro, after decades of struggle, will enjoy their rights of ECCD consistent with their distinct belief, culture, and aspirations.

**Poverty incidence.** According to PSA report on poverty, BARMM has the highest significant improvement from 52.6 percent in 2018 to 29.80 percent in 2021. However, the region remains as poorest compared to other regions in the country and the island provinces of BaSulTa are among the cluster with relatively high incidence of poverty among families. Accordingly, 2 to 3 out of 10 families in the BARMM belong to poor families. Annual per capita poverty threshold in BARMM is at Php14,126.00, which is ranked 10th in the country.

Several factors contributed to this historic drop in poverty in the region. Among them are the various programs, particularly social protection programs, implemented by the Bangsamoro government supplemented by the existing programs of the national government such as Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) and Social Pension. While there has been a significant drop in the poverty incidence or the proportion of poor Bangsamoro whose per capita income is not sufficient to meet their basic food and non-food needs, the value is still higher than the national average of 23.7 percent.

### Social Protection

**Older persons.** The Social Pension for Indigent Senior Citizen Program is implemented to provide indigent senior citizens who are frail, sick, and disabled with a monthly stipend amounting to Php500, as mandated by RA 9994, otherwise known as "Expanded Senior Citizen Act of 2010". The program aims to augment the capacity of indigent senior citizens to meet their daily subsistence and medical requirements, reduce the incidence of hunger, and protect them from neglect, abuse, and deprivation.

As of December 2021, a total of 159,172 indigent senior citizens are enrolled in the program. From 2017-2021, an increasing trend of older persons can be observed across the BARMM.

**Child labor rampant in BARMM.** Based on the Situation Analysis Report of UNICEF, as of October 2020, 7.5 percent of working children in the Philippines are found in BARMM, with about 54,200 child laborers in the region. This is attributed to high poverty incidence in the region. Children prefer to engage in livelihood activities to help their parents for daily survival. This also affects the education performance of the BARMM as explained in the education subsector.

**Violence Against Children.** Based on the findings of the Child Protection System Assessment in BARMM, there were 93 cases referred into the child protection system in Lanao del Sur from 2017-2021. While the data from Maguindanao did not provide a comprehensive list of child protection referrals, it did indicate that relatively small numbers of cases are coming before the formal protection system. Between 2016 and 2020, 50 children were provided with an initial assessment and 20 were provided with an in-depth child protection assessment. The data further indicates that services were delivered to 90 children (including financial support, counselling, and parenting training), and 23 children were placed in different forms of alternative care over the six years period.

Furthermore, compounded with poverty, decade of armed conflict and underinvestment in essential services for children resulted to a wide range of other child protection issues such as children in conflict with the law, child trafficking, child early and forced marriage (CEFM), child laborers 5-17 years at 9.1 percent, and birth registration rate remains relatively low at 77 percent in the region.

**BARMM has only 1,310 functional day care centers (DCCs) in 2,590 barangays.** All children have the right to go to school and learn. Education transforms children's lives by helping them overcome poverty. It decreases social inequalities, empowers people, and helps everyone reach their full potential. Early child care and development begin at day care center. Absence of this center manifested the absence of concrete initiative for child development. As of March 2022, BARMM has only 1,310 functional DCCs out of 2,590 barangays in the region.

**Table 9.12 Status of Day Care Children and Centers in the BARMM as of March 2022**

**Recurring displacement in BARMM.** With the presence of hydrometeorological and geological hazards coupled with human-induced hazards, displacement is recurring in the region. This situation substantially affects the socioeconomic development of the region. Access to education is hampered, protection mechanisms are weakened, and the problem of health services is worsened. Thus, aggravate the pre-existing child protection issues and present new risks and threats such as high prevalence rate of child labor, trafficking, increasing number of out-of-school youth (OSY), illegal recruitment and family separation.

As of September 2022, 914 families (4,570 people) are still displaced due to armed conflict, with a direct effect on children and girls in particular, who become more vulnerable to child marriage when displaced. In addition, children continue to be exposed to grave violations in BARMM provinces, although such instances are in decline. For example, between January 2020 and December 2021, 27 verified incidents of killing and maiming of children were committed in Maguindanao and 14 in Sulu, and one attack on a school in Maguindanao was reported, whereas in 2017, 135 violations were committed, which mostly took place in the Lanao del Sur Province. In addition, the conflict has left behind many orphans of soldiers, or civilians killed. Whilst there is no official data on orphans of war, an unofficial database held by the MILF's Social Welfare Committee (SWC) reportedly "has a list of 8,182 orphans covering 26 out of 47 revolutionary 'provinces' as of April 2019", while "the MILF's Bangsamoro Islamic Women Auxiliary Brigade (BIWAB) is working on a partial list with just over 500 widows and a similar number of orphans as of January 2020."

Based on IDP Durable Solution Report, there are 93,525 IDPs in the BARMM, including the protracted displaced in Marawi City and other areas in the region, which represents 82.5 percent of the total number of IDPs in Mindanao as of August 2022. A total of 329,360 individuals are affected by armed conflict and flooding in Maguindanao.

**Protection of persons with disability.** There are 53,483 PWDs with increased capacity to meet their daily subsistence and medical requirements. Government programs are carefully laid to ensure their meaningful participation in the society.

**Gender and development (GAD).** There has been progress in terms of compliance at the regional level on the mandated implementation of at least five 5.0 percent of the total annual budget of each ministry and office. A review of the GAD Plans and Budgets (GPBs) at the regional level revealed that for FY 2021, 6.1 percent of the Php75.6 billion appropriation of the regional government, or Php4,661,116,872.32 was utilized for GAD. This was an improvement from 2020's Php255.52 million. The increase in GAD utilization was a result of the improved GAD attribution using the Harmonized GAD Guidelines (HGDG). However, most of the direct GAD interventions in the GPBs were on building and strengthening the capacities of ministries and offices. This is understandable because majority of the personnel are newly hired. However, there should have been a ladderized training program to allow GAD planners and implementers to progress on their GAD knowledge, skills, and attitude. These three competencies are critical to ensuring a more effective and efficient GAD planning, budgeting, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation.

## Development Opportunities

Despite the pressing challenges mentioned above, the Bangsamoro government has identified the following opportunities that can be harnessed to address the identified challenges.

**Commitment of development partners to support BARMM.** Immediately after the passage of the BOL, various international donor institutions renewed and enhanced their support to the new autonomous region. This is to facilitate the implementation of a peace agreement between the GPH and the MILF.

The presence of these development partners is a great opportunity for the Bangsamoro government to fast track the socioeconomic development of the BARMM. They fill in the gaps that cannot be covered by the existing resources of the region, especially in the areas of capacity development, policy formulation, planning, and investment programming. Moreover, development partners pursue public interest agenda and aid government agencies in its peace and development efforts.

**Strong inter-governmental relations and support from the national government.** The creation of National government-Bangsamoro government IGRB under Section 2 of RA 11054 is another opportunity to serve as venue of vertical communication for proper implementation of the peace agreement and to foster clear cooperation and complementation between the national government and the Bangsamoro government. Under the said provision, the IGRB shall exhaust all means to resolve issues brought before it. Unresolved issues shall be elevated to the President, through the Chief Minister.

**Devolution of basic services under Mandanas-Garcia ruling.** The implementation of Mandanas-Garcia Ruling is another opportunity since it strengthens the devolution of delivery of basic services to LGUs. Although EO 138 does not include BARMM, but the principle of devolution of basic services and facilities to the LGUs and the determination of the functional assignments between and among the different levels of government shall be observed.

This is an opportunity for the BARMM to strengthen decentralization and improve social services delivery. Also, it will lead to better coordination in planning and implementation across levels of government because of proper delineation of powers and responsibilities that could contribute in improving the lives of people and communities, especially in far-flung areas.

**Three-year extension transition period.** The extension of transition period to 2025 will help the Bangsamoro government to fully operationalize the government structure, and complete the enactment of remaining priority codes and issuance of policy guidelines, to clearly define and delineate the powers, functions and responsibilities, and strengthening horizontal and vertical coordination and linkages.

**Fiscal autonomy.** Granting of fiscal autonomy to the Bangsamoro government is another opportunity since the BARMM is now authorized to design and finance its own development program according to the region's thrusts and priorities with minimal restrictions.

As provided in the BOL, the Bangsamoro government shall enjoy fiscal autonomy with the end view of attaining economic self-sufficiency and genuine development. The Bangsamoro government is entitled to all fund sources enumerated herein and shall have the power to create its sources of revenues, which shall be spent in a programmatic, transparent, performance-based, and phased manner. It shall prepare its budget and allocate funds in accordance with an annual appropriations law passed by the Parliament.

**Presence of universities, colleges, other formal and informal academic stakeholders.** Utilization of existing universities, colleges, and other formal and informal academic institutions is also considered as an opportunity like MSU-Main in Marawi City and MSU-Maguindanao, and informal education such as a mobile library for street children in Cotabato City, as well as Tahfizul Qur-an in Basilan and Marawi City as these will provide more access to balanced quality education in the BARMM.

**Presence of functional women and youth organizations/cooperatives in the mainland and island provinces.** Their participation in governance representing women and youth sectors will help make the decision-making more inclusive and meaningful.

## Priority Challenges

**Increasing vulnerability due to high poverty and social inequality.** Social injustice hampered the access of people from enjoying basic services. As a consequence, the region is suffering from a low HDI that includes low level of family income, low functional literacy rate, and short life expectancy. Thus, the level of vulnerability to natural and human-induced disasters worsened due to limited adaptive capacity as a result of poverty. In addition, recurring displacement, loss of life, destruction of properties, and cyclical disruption of socioeconomic activities become an undesired usual phenomenon. At the sub-sectoral level, BARMM is confronted with the following challenges:

### Education

**Limited access to quality, responsive, and relevant education** - The BARMM faces serious challenges of poor access to and low-quality education — basic, higher, technical, and Madaris education. Perennial issue on poor educational governance and management at the community level worsens the situation.

a. **Poor access to education** - As a consequence, the region lags behind compared to other regions in most education indicators. The net enrolment rate for the region is posted at 72.63 percent for elementary, and 30.37 percent for secondary compared to the national average of 94.19 percent and 76.0 percent, respectively. The completion rate for primary and secondary are the lowest, while the dropout rate for primary and secondary is the highest in the country. The region has the lowest cohort survival rate of 64.75 percent. Another factor affecting education in the BARMM is the plaguing of poverty as the poor family prefers to let their children help daily earning rather than sending them to school. Also, some students do not have interest in taking up agricultural-related courses.

b. **Low quality education.** Construction of classrooms and provision of learning materials paralleled a fast-growing population is another factor that affects education in the BARMM. Based on a result of consultation with young people, some schools are too dense, teacher and students' ratio are not favorable for learning, not to mention the shortage of classrooms and other facilities. In addition, the poor education management at the grassroot level substantially affects the region's quality education at the different levels. Incomplete institutionalization of Madaris education, weak support for public and private Madrasah, and low salaries of Asatidz particularly in GIDA were also some of the issues confronting the region.

### Health, Nutrition, and WaSH

**Limited access and utilization of quality health service.** The Bangsamoro health sector is confronted with the serious challenge of improving accessibility and providing quality health services. This can be associated with the following key issues such as:

a. **Inefficient healthcare system.** The low turnout of the health outcomes in the region constitutes the inadequacy of skilled human resources and equipped functional health facilities. These can be associated with weak, if not lacking, context-based policies, regulations, and funding. Additionally, the unavailability of data and the poor data management on health, and challenging geography are also among the factors that hamper identification of accurate strategic action to improve the healthcare system in the region.

The limited involvement of the LGUs in delivering health services in their respective communities is also a challenge. The political will, including the budget allocation for health from the LGUs, are an essential factor in improving the health outcomes in the region but remain a challenge despite the moral governance advocacy of the BARMM government.

b. **Limited access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene services.** Over the years, varying data on the accessibility and availability of sanitation and safe water exhibited poor programming due to the lack of mechanisms that should provide long-term solutions to the existing gaps. The problem also lies in the limited involvement of the LGUs in enforcing existing national and regional ordinances on environmental health and sanitation. Furthermore, the lack of a cohesive environmental plan, especially at the LGU level, highly contributed to the poor health status of the region, especially in water-borne related diseases. A comprehensive Adolescent Health, Nutrition and WASH program is also limited in BARMM.

c. **Inadequate dietary intake.** There are existing policies and plans for FSN in BARMM. However, weak structures and harmonization affect the accuracy of the planning, financing, policymaking, and implementation of programs, projects, and activities. While at the LGU level, the lack of initiatives and efforts to combat malnutrition highly contributed to the poor nutrition situation in the region. Additionally, there is a weak monitoring system for implementing these plans and policies. It has also been identified that the limited opportunities for the livelihood of families in BARMM remain one of the contributors to prevalent nutritional imbalances and food insecurity in the region. The cost of nutritious diet is very high determined by levels of food production, stock, and net trade. The physical and economic access to nutritious food especially among the marginalized sector of the community is limited. Food utilization is also very low.

On the other hand, micronutrient supplementation, supplementary feeding, management of acute malnutrition and overweight prevention and management is a big gap to be addressed in the region.

d. **Behavioral change.** Some Bangsamoro are hesitant to avail health services due to limited awareness on the importance of modern healing methods. This is evident in low turnout of COVID-19 vaccination and other health services. This is worsened by the prevalence of malnutrition, improper sanitation, increasing number of teenage pregnancy and continuously growing number of unmet needs of the population especially at the community level due to poor family planning services, traditional mindset, and poor IEC awareness on family planning.

### Social Welfare

**High number of poor and vulnerable people in the BARMM.** BARMM is challenged with the high number of poor and vulnerable people with limited meaningful participation in the basic sectors. Based on the 2021 poverty incidence released by the PSA, the region recorded the highest decline in poverty incidence among families from 52.60 percent in 2018 to 29.80 percent in 2021. It is worth noting that 3 out of the 5 provinces of BARMM reduced the number of poor families with Lanao del Sur having the highest decrease from 64.2 percent in 2018 to 7.4 percent in 2021. In contrast, two of the region's provinces, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi, increased the number of poor families from 75.3 percent and 15.1 percent in 2018 to 51.0 percent and 28.1 percent respectively in 2021.

Approximately, 408,951 Bangsamoro families live in poverty. With a high volume of inequality, poverty remains to be one of the most significant challenges in the BARMM.

Poor people in the BARMM are more vulnerable to falling further into extreme poverty due to their exposure to disasters. A person's age, sex, disabilities, cultural, and religious identities; access to income opportunities and other safety nets; and level of participation in decision-making processes further amplify their vulnerabilities.

a. **High vulnerability to human-induced and natural disasters.** One of the main contributing factors to BARMM's high poverty incidence is the region's high vulnerability to shocks, with over a third of all households in BARMM affected by at least one emergency in any given year. With limited coping mechanisms at their disposal, most households in BARMM cannot deal with the impact of shocks, further aggravating their dire situation.

Four of the five provinces in BARMM are considered the most drought-prone in the country. These are Sulu, Basilan, Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur. Maguindanao appears to be the province most affected by natural disasters.

BARMM is particularly vulnerable to climate change, which is expected to increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. All five provinces in BARMM are either 'vulnerable' or 'highly vulnerable' to El Nino induced drought, temperature increases, and rising sea levels brought about by climate change. The region's poorest and most vulnerable households are highly exposed to naturally occurring hazards and have the least capacity to cope with or adapt to the changing climate. Moreover, vulnerable groups such as women, children, the elderly, and those with disabilities face a range of pre-existing challenges that are often compounded by disasters. For example, natural disasters often negatively impact access to basic services and render children more vulnerable to deprivation of their basic rights.

Amidst vulnerability to extreme weather events, disaster risk management in the BARMM is significantly challenged due to poor mobilization of disaster management and poor disaster allocation; insufficient government initiatives to calamities; poor knowledge of community disaster preparedness programs; and loose compliance to local government code. Moreover, there are no trained community-based DRR for COs; evacuation facilities are absent, and there is a lack of proper utilization of funds which is intended for DRR.

During emergencies and crises, women and girls, children and young people become vulnerable to exploitation and violence due to the breakdown of community networks and structures, and lack of protection mechanisms. GBV is also one of the key drivers of conflict that often escalates into full-scale family feud or rido.

Particular attention must be given to the IDPs in the region to promote their rights and welfare, ensure their safe return, and prevent new or recurrent displacement. In addition, the Bangsamoro government is committed in addressing the high vulnerability of OFWs to maltreatment and trafficking.

b. **Low social protection coverage among poor families.** Social welfare programs in BARMM are composed of both national and regional programs, each of which is designed to a particular vulnerable sector, including orphaned children, individuals living with disabilities, and poor and vulnerable households. The national programs are designed, financed, and overseen by the national government, and include national flagship social protection programs such as the 4Ps, SLP and the social pension.

The regional social welfare programs are implemented and financed by MSSD to ensure that vulnerable sub-groups of the population are protected. These programs are specifically geared to stem social vulnerabilities that arise from personal characteristics such as age, disability, and familial circumstances.

However, the implementation of social programs in the BARMM is not clear in terms of linkages between DRM at the policy level. Disaster risk and vulnerability assessments have not been conducted across all LGUs. A thorough understanding of the different risks faced by different geographic areas and population groups is essential to inform strategies for social protection scale-up.

There is no formal early warning system for conflict. Some informal mechanisms are present at the grassroots level, but these are not systematically adopted into government systems. Many IDPs are without documentation and as such face barriers in accessing services.

Current social transfer programming largely excludes children in the first 1,000 days of their lives, a critical period for investment from an economic and human developmental perspective and has a fragmented regional poverty registry. Developing a BARMM poverty registry will enable the flow and management of information to ensure a more responsive, equitable and inclusive distribution of resources while also increasing efficiency and effectiveness of social protection delivery, thus, better serving the Bangsamoro.

The majority of the population are in the informal sector, with no access to social protection coverage. Based on IDP Durable Solution Report, IDPs have poor access to information affecting their welfare, a finding that was surfaced in a consultative forum. They feel excluded and, sometimes, discriminated. The political and security environment can, in some areas, curtail their ability to properly exercise their rights to vote and be consulted regarding public and peace matters.

c. **Low-income opportunities.** BARMM ranks third with the highest prevalence of child labor in the country according to PSA. Due to poverty, children are forced to work instead of sending them to school. In 2017, net enrollment rates in BARMM fell below the national average by about 20 percentage points at the elementary level and 45 percentage points at the junior high school (JHS) level. The regional school completion rates are equally concerning, particularly for indigenous children. Only 48.5 percent of indigenous children in BARMM attend elementary school while 11.2 percent complete basic education. In 2019, only 10.0 percent of the child population reached at least college level or higher and only 1 out of every 10 students who begin primary education completes JHS on time.

The figures point to a crisis in the delivery of basic education in the BARMM, a crisis that needs to be addressed as a priority to keep children in school and to provide better quality education. Also, a combination of armed conflict, exclusion, marginalization, and child labor have contributed to lagging education.

In addition to poor educational attainment in BARMM is the poor access to educational opportunities such as scholarships and other study grant programs and poor access to livelihood opportunities and disrupted livelihoods due to displacement.

d. **Low meaningful participation of basic sector.** Some LGUs do not recognize the importance or representation of the basic sector, such as women, adolescents and youth, senior citizens, and PWDs, during council meetings, resulting in low meaningful participation of the basic sector. One of the reasons is lack of proper and contextualized engagement that provides truthful representation, lack of basic learning development on organizational, sectoral, and community-based empowerment, the presence of direct and indirect sectoral discrimination or biases, and poor local government initiatives to engage local sectors in every program.

Also putting forward the interests of the young people at the political table is sometimes discounted and overlooked citing it lacks the notion of meaningful participation in local governance. Prevailing laws recognize a fixed 10.0 percent budget for the sector, but it is relatively detached and marked as a less priority. Preferential system in local politics is widely practiced. Similarly, people/children with disabilities are often omitted in the local agendas and the BLGUs do not have a designated desk for them catering to their appeals.
