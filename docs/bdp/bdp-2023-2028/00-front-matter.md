## Foreword

My warmest greetings to the officers, members, and staff of the Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority (BPDA) on the publication of the 2nd Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP) 2023-2028.

In keeping with your vision of becoming a premier center for socio-economic planning in the Bangsamoro region, I hope that the BDP 2023-2028 will serve as a guidepost as you address the most pressing problems that we face today. With your ability to formulate data-driven and research-based programs, you have the capacity to devise measures that are not only feasible, but also sustainable in the long run.

May this development plan also enable you to positively respond to the needs and expectations of Filipinos, filling the remaining gaps among our local sectors and boosting the progress of the BARMM and the entire country. I trust that it will further move our people to participate in strengthening our communities and reassuring that the government looks after their welfare as they cope with the changing realities of society.

Alongside your efforts to deliver quality services to the Filipino people, I am confident that your passion for service, love for fellows, and hope for the future will guide you in fortifying the key industries of our society. Rest assured that the administration is ever united with you in establishing a more informed, strategic, and progressive Philippines.

Congratulations on this accomplishment. Mabuhay tayong lahat!

## Message from NEDA

Living through a pandemic in this volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (or VUCA) world is a sure test of resilience and tenacity for all of us striving to bounce back from this unprecedented health and socioeconomic crisis. The challenge—as well as our plans and strategies—may have changed. Still, our long-term vision - the AmBisyon Natin 2040 — remains clear and firm: achieving a matatag, maginhawa, at panatag na buhay for all Filipinos by 2040.

Building upon the lessons learned in the last three years, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), in close coordination with other government agencies and stakeholders, formulated and completed the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2023-2028. As articulated in the Plan, our goal is to reinvigorate job creation and accelerate poverty reduction by steering the economy back to its high-growth path. We will work to achieve deep economic and social transformation for a prosperous, inclusive, and resilient society. Anchored on the 8-point Socioeconomic Agenda of President Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos, Jr., the PDP 2023-2028 contains strategies seeking to address both short-term challenges and medium-term constraints to economic growth. Short-term challenges, in particular, encompass concerns such as the rising prices of commodities due to global inflationary pressures, the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health and education, and the impact of global supply chain disruptions on employment and food security.

Addressing challenges of this magnitude requires a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach. The Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP) 2023-2028 is a testament to the region's commitment to transforming governance in Bangsamoro and harnessing the region's full potential in achieving economic transformation for prosperity, inclusivity, and resilience. On the other hand, the PDP highlights strategies to support a smooth and complete transition of the Bangsamoro government and strengthen intergovernmental coordination and collaboration.

Hence, I would like to convey my appreciation to the Bangsamoro Economic and Development Council for its commitment to formulating the BDP 2023-2028 and directing numerous regional development initiatives for an "empowered, cohesive, and progressive Bangsamoro." I would also like to thank the Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority for their participation in the formulation of the PDP. We look forward to a stronger, more productive partnership in the years ahead.

Finally, I call for the cooperation of our local government units, ministries and other offices, private institutions, non-government organizations, and members of civil society to join us in this collective endeavor. Through our united effort, we are a step closer to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, and resilient society in the BARMM and the whole country.

## Message from the Chief Minister

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem
Assalamu Alaykum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu!

In 2020, the Bangsamoro government formally launched the 1st Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP) 2020-2022, a three-year roadmap for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) which aims to uplift the lives of the Bangsamoro people and establish the foundations of self-governance. At the height of its implementation, the whole world was confronted by the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic - a global health crisis that brought enormous change to all aspects of life and our daily routines; our region, the BARMM, was no exception. Amid the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, BARMM's economic performance has increased despite being in a delicate transition period. According to the Philippines Statistics Authority (PSA), BARMM has recorded a significant rise in its economic performance by 7.5 percent in 2021 and a significant decline in poverty incidence since 2018.

However, the coverage of the 1st BDP ended on December 31, 2022. This prompted the interim Bangsamoro government to direct the Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority (BPDA), through the Bangsamoro Economic and Development Council (BEDC), to spearhead and jumpstart the initial assessment of the 1st BDP and 12-Point Priority Agenda as a preparation for the formulation of a successor plan.

During the process, the BEDC ensured an inclusive formulation of the 2nd BDP by soliciting inputs and recommendations from various stakeholders during the regionwide consultation in the region's mainland and island provinces. We consulted our provincial, city, and municipal local government units, academic institutions, business sector, and civil society organizations. As part of the extensive formulation of the 2nd BDP, series of workshops and writeshops which include the assessment of the 1st BDP and enhancement of the BARMM 12-Point Priority Agenda, as well as the simultaneous formulation of some essential documents such as the 1st Bangsamoro Ecological Profile (BEP), 1st BARMM Development Policy Research Agenda (BDPRA), and Bangsamoro Spatial Development Framework (BSDF).

After several months of arduously working on this document, it is with great pride and honor that I present the 2nd Bangsamoro Development Plan 2023-2028—a plan that will sustain the gains and pursue the development thrusts, priorities, and strategies of the Bangsamoro government that were outlined in the 1st BDP.

With its successful completion, I humbly acknowledge the contributions of all institutions who took part in crafting this development plan. This includes all the regional ministries, offices, and agencies of the BARMM and our ever-supportive development partners, The Asia Foundation (TAF), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and Support to Bangsamoro Transition (SUBATRA). I sincerely thank you all for your commitment and support. Indeed, with our collaborative efforts, we were able to craft a plan that will aid in transforming the Bangsamoro region by identifying durable solutions towards a smooth transition to normalization, sustaining peace, and attaining socioeconomic development in our region.

Finally, all praise and glory to Allah (SWT) for His grace and mercy over the Bangsamoro. May He continue to bless and guide us to implement this plan for the betterment of our beloved homeland and our people.

Shukran and Wassalam!

## Preface

Assalamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu.

All praises and thanks to the Almighty Allah (SWT) for the gift of wisdom and guidance to continue our commitment for the success of Bangsamoro including the completion of the 2nd Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP) 2023-2028, and its accompanying Results Matrices (RM), Bangsamoro Development Investment Program (BDIP), and BARMM Development Policy Research Agenda (BDPRA).

This successor plan of the 1st BDP 2020-2022 outlines the development priorities of the Bangsamoro government for its three-year extension period and beyond. It also serves as the basis for programming and utilization of the Special Development Fund (SDF) as provided under Article XIV, Section 2 of Republic Act (RA) No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL). It is also anchored to the 8-point socioeconomic agenda of the Marcos Administration, Philippine Development Plan (PDP), and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The 2nd BDP 2023-2028 consists of 14 chapters that highlights a broad, encompassing, and participatory planning methodology which focuses on the development agenda, thrusts, and priorities to address the significant challenges in the region.

The five sectoral planning committees of the BEDC namely: 1) Development Administration Committee (DACom), 2) Economic Development Committee (EDCom), 3) Social Development Committee (SDCom), 4) Infrastructure Development Committee (IDCom), and 5) Peace, Public Order, Safety and Security Committee (PPOSSCom) spearheaded the formulation of the plan through series of workshops, writeshops, and consultations involving the different BARMM ministries, six provinces (Maguindanao del Norte, Maguindanao del Sur, Lanao del Sur, Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi), three cities (Marawi City, Lamitan City, and Cotabato City), the Special Geographic Area (SGA), academe, and CSOs to ensure an inclusive, comprehensive, well-coordinated, and responsive medium-term plan that will guide the policymakers and development stakeholders in identifying strategies, and implement programs, and projects to attain the overall goal of the Bangsamoro region.

As the technical secretariat of the BEDC, the BPDA is honored to lead the successful formulation of the 2nd BDP 2023-2028, a plan that will continue the development initiatives of the Bangsamoro government to achieve an empowered, cohesive and progressive Bangsamoro.

Our deepest gratitude to our development partners and consultants for extending their full support since the beginning of the plan formulation process. May this strengthen our existing collaboration and partnership to realize our dreams and aspirations for the Bangsamoro.

Shukran and Wassalam!
