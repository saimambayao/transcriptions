## Foreword

My warmest greetings to the officers, members, and staff of the Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority (BPDA) on the publication of the 2nd Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP) 2023-2028.

In keeping with your vision of becoming a premier center for socio-economic planning in the Bangsamoro region, I hope that the BDP 2023-2028 will serve as a guidepost as you address the most pressing problems that we face today. With your ability to formulate data-driven and research-based programs, you have the capacity to devise measures that are not only feasible, but also sustainable in the long run.

May this development plan also enable you to positively respond to the needs and expectations of Filipinos, filling the remaining gaps among our local sectors and boosting the progress of the BARMM and the entire country. I trust that it will further move our people to participate in strengthening our communities and reassuring that the government looks after their welfare as they cope with the changing realities of society.

Alongside your efforts to deliver quality services to the Filipino people, I am confident that your passion for service, love for fellows, and hope for the future will guide you in fortifying the key industries of our society. Rest assured that the administration is ever united with you in establishing a more informed, strategic, and progressive Philippines.

Congratulations on this accomplishment. Mabuhay tayong lahat!

## Message from NEDA

Living through a pandemic in this volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (or VUCA) world is a sure test of resilience and tenacity for all of us striving to bounce back from this unprecedented health and socioeconomic crisis. The challenge—as well as our plans and strategies—may have changed. Still, our long-term vision - the AmBisyon Natin 2040 — remains clear and firm: achieving a matatag, maginhawa, at panatag na buhay for all Filipinos by 2040.

Building upon the lessons learned in the last three years, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), in close coordination with other government agencies and stakeholders, formulated and completed the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2023-2028. As articulated in the Plan, our goal is to reinvigorate job creation and accelerate poverty reduction by steering the economy back to its high-growth path. We will work to achieve deep economic and social transformation for a prosperous, inclusive, and resilient society. Anchored on the 8-point Socioeconomic Agenda of President Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos, Jr., the PDP 2023-2028 contains strategies seeking to address both short-term challenges and medium-term constraints to economic growth. Short-term challenges, in particular, encompass concerns such as the rising prices of commodities due to global inflationary pressures, the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health and education, and the impact of global supply chain disruptions on employment and food security.

Addressing challenges of this magnitude requires a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach. The Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP) 2023-2028 is a testament to the region's commitment to transforming governance in Bangsamoro and harnessing the region's full potential in achieving economic transformation for prosperity, inclusivity, and resilience. On the other hand, the PDP highlights strategies to support a smooth and complete transition of the Bangsamoro government and strengthen intergovernmental coordination and collaboration.

Hence, I would like to convey my appreciation to the Bangsamoro Economic and Development Council for its commitment to formulating the BDP 2023-2028 and directing numerous regional development initiatives for an "empowered, cohesive, and progressive Bangsamoro." I would also like to thank the Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority for their participation in the formulation of the PDP. We look forward to a stronger, more productive partnership in the years ahead.

Finally, I call for the cooperation of our local government units, ministries and other offices, private institutions, non-government organizations, and members of civil society to join us in this collective endeavor. Through our united effort, we are a step closer to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, and resilient society in the BARMM and the whole country.

## Message from the Chief Minister

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem
Assalamu Alaykum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu!

In 2020, the Bangsamoro government formally launched the 1st Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP) 2020-2022, a three-year roadmap for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) which aims to uplift the lives of the Bangsamoro people and establish the foundations of self-governance. At the height of its implementation, the whole world was confronted by the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic - a global health crisis that brought enormous change to all aspects of life and our daily routines; our region, the BARMM, was no exception. Amid the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, BARMM's economic performance has increased despite being in a delicate transition period. According to the Philippines Statistics Authority (PSA), BARMM has recorded a significant rise in its economic performance by 7.5 percent in 2021 and a significant decline in poverty incidence since 2018.

However, the coverage of the 1st BDP ended on December 31, 2022. This prompted the interim Bangsamoro government to direct the Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority (BPDA), through the Bangsamoro Economic and Development Council (BEDC), to spearhead and jumpstart the initial assessment of the 1st BDP and 12-Point Priority Agenda as a preparation for the formulation of a successor plan.

During the process, the BEDC ensured an inclusive formulation of the 2nd BDP by soliciting inputs and recommendations from various stakeholders during the regionwide consultation in the region's mainland and island provinces. We consulted our provincial, city, and municipal local government units, academic institutions, business sector, and civil society organizations. As part of the extensive formulation of the 2nd BDP, series of workshops and writeshops which include the assessment of the 1st BDP and enhancement of the BARMM 12-Point Priority Agenda, as well as the simultaneous formulation of some essential documents such as the 1st Bangsamoro Ecological Profile (BEP), 1st BARMM Development Policy Research Agenda (BDPRA), and Bangsamoro Spatial Development Framework (BSDF).

After several months of arduously working on this document, it is with great pride and honor that I present the 2nd Bangsamoro Development Plan 2023-2028—a plan that will sustain the gains and pursue the development thrusts, priorities, and strategies of the Bangsamoro government that were outlined in the 1st BDP.

With its successful completion, I humbly acknowledge the contributions of all institutions who took part in crafting this development plan. This includes all the regional ministries, offices, and agencies of the BARMM and our ever-supportive development partners, The Asia Foundation (TAF), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and Support to Bangsamoro Transition (SUBATRA). I sincerely thank you all for your commitment and support. Indeed, with our collaborative efforts, we were able to craft a plan that will aid in transforming the Bangsamoro region by identifying durable solutions towards a smooth transition to normalization, sustaining peace, and attaining socioeconomic development in our region.

Finally, all praise and glory to Allah (SWT) for His grace and mercy over the Bangsamoro. May He continue to bless and guide us to implement this plan for the betterment of our beloved homeland and our people.

Shukran and Wassalam!

## Preface

Assalamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu.

All praises and thanks to the Almighty Allah (SWT) for the gift of wisdom and guidance to continue our commitment for the success of Bangsamoro including the completion of the 2nd Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP) 2023-2028, and its accompanying Results Matrices (RM), Bangsamoro Development Investment Program (BDIP), and BARMM Development Policy Research Agenda (BDPRA).

This successor plan of the 1st BDP 2020-2022 outlines the development priorities of the Bangsamoro government for its three-year extension period and beyond. It also serves as the basis for programming and utilization of the Special Development Fund (SDF) as provided under Article XIV, Section 2 of Republic Act (RA) No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL). It is also anchored to the 8-point socioeconomic agenda of the Marcos Administration, Philippine Development Plan (PDP), and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The 2nd BDP 2023-2028 consists of 14 chapters that highlights a broad, encompassing, and participatory planning methodology which focuses on the development agenda, thrusts, and priorities to address the significant challenges in the region.

The five sectoral planning committees of the BEDC namely: 1) Development Administration Committee (DACom), 2) Economic Development Committee (EDCom), 3) Social Development Committee (SDCom), 4) Infrastructure Development Committee (IDCom), and 5) Peace, Public Order, Safety and Security Committee (PPOSSCom) spearheaded the formulation of the plan through series of workshops, writeshops, and consultations involving the different BARMM ministries, six provinces (Maguindanao del Norte, Maguindanao del Sur, Lanao del Sur, Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi), three cities (Marawi City, Lamitan City, and Cotabato City), the Special Geographic Area (SGA), academe, and CSOs to ensure an inclusive, comprehensive, well-coordinated, and responsive medium-term plan that will guide the policymakers and development stakeholders in identifying strategies, and implement programs, and projects to attain the overall goal of the Bangsamoro region.

As the technical secretariat of the BEDC, the BPDA is honored to lead the successful formulation of the 2nd BDP 2023-2028, a plan that will continue the development initiatives of the Bangsamoro government to achieve an empowered, cohesive and progressive Bangsamoro.

Our deepest gratitude to our development partners and consultants for extending their full support since the beginning of the plan formulation process. May this strengthen our existing collaboration and partnership to realize our dreams and aspirations for the Bangsamoro.

Shukran and Wassalam!

# Chapter 1: BARMM and the Extended Transition

This chapter has three parts. The first part discusses the BARMM regional context before and the ongoing transition, the second part narrates the institutional context, and the third part talks about the extended transition and the salient features of the 2nd BDP 2023-2028.

## Regional Context

For decades, the region was in a "conflict trap", characterized by a sustained ebb and flow of violence that was precipitated by a myriad of actors, interests, triggers, and underlying causes. It was and still is in a fragile state. This fragility and the turbulent nature of the political landscape of the region came at a high cost: limited economic growth, a low level of human development, and gaps and disruptions in service delivery.

There were significant events aimed to have a lasting solution to these patterns of violence in the region. Among them include: the signing of the 1996 Final Peace Agreement (FPA) between the Government of the Philippines (GPH) and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) that led to the creation of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM); the signing of the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro (FAB) and the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB) between the GPH and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) under the Benigno Aquino administration; and, the ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) under the Duterte administration that replaced ARMM with BARMM as the new political entity.

The BOL and the installation of a new form of government signaled a new era in governance—Moral Governance. A 12-Point Priority Agenda was laid out with the intent of outlining the priorities within the transition period, which was then supported by the Bangsamoro Development Framework (BDF). This was later translated to a term-based plan called the 1st BDP which articulates moral governance in terms of sectoral outcomes, strategies, and priority programs, projects, and activities (PPAs).

The 1st BDP was an attempt to put in place a sense of predictability in the political and governance landscape of the region during the transition. It served as a development roadmap for the newly installed government and as a basis for annual programming and budgeting. It reflected the transformational results to be achieved within three years and the accompanying strategies, cognizant of the regional and institutional realities. As a regional plan, there was a deliberate effort to align with the PDP 2017-2022 and the 0-10 Socioeconomic Agenda of the Duterte administration.

Despite the significant promise and opportunities of the transition, its starting points were fraught with developmental and institutional challenges. These include: (1) high incidence of poverty; (2) lowest contribution to the national economy; (3) low performance outcomes on health and education; (4) continuing threats to peace, security, public order and safety; (5) insufficient infrastructure facilities; (6) vulnerability to climate change; (7) disruption in service delivery with the gradual phasing out of offices and personnel of the former ARMM; among others.

Based on the assessment of the BARMM performance, there were remarkable changes in the overall regional context. The region has high performance in achieving macroeconomic targets. Five out of six macroeconomic targets set in the 1st BDP were achieved.

### Table 1.1 Macroeconomic Targets set in the 1st BDP 2020-2022

| PERFORMANCE INDICATOR | BASELINE (as reflected in BDP) | END-OF-PLAN TARGET | STATUS | EVIDENCE/MOV |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GRDP Annual Growth Rate | 7.2% (2018) | 7.0% - 7.5% | 7.5% (2021) | Philippine Statistical Authority (PSA) Report |
| Population Growth Rate | 3.78% (2018) | 4.2% | 3.26% (2020) | PSA Report |
| Labor Force Participation Rate | 46.6% (2018) | 46.0% - 50.0% | 60% (2021) | PSA Report |
| Unemployment Rate | 3.7% (2018) | 3.0% | 7.60% (2021) | PSA Report |
| Inflation Rate | 7.09% (2018) | 4.5% - 5.0% | 2.40% (2021) | PSA Report |
| Poverty Incidence (among families) | 52.6% (2018) | 49.6% | 29.80% (2021) | PSA Report |

### Second fastest growing economy in the country

In 2021, BARMM registered 7.5 percent annual economic growth, the second highest growth rate in the country. It was a strong rebound from the -1.9 percent growth in 2020, which was largely caused by the pandemic. This is a strong manifestation that the region is on its way to recovery from the adverse effects of the pandemic.

In addition, BARMM is demonstrating to be moving at the same economic pace with its neighbors. The region registered the highest growth rate in 2017, 2018, 2020, and 2021 in Mindanao. At the time of the pandemic, it registered a decline of -1.9 percent, the lowest among the Mindanao regions.

Even though the BARMM's economic growth is at par with the national average, the regional contribution to national economic output is lowest at 1.4 percent.

### Structural transformation in BARMM's economic landscape

Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing (AFF) used to be the leading sector in BARMM 20 years ago, accounting for more than half of the region's economic output. The industry sector had the lowest contribution, accounting for less than 10 percent of the region's economic output.

A structural change is observed in the past 20 years. By 2021, the services sector replaced AFF as the leading sector, accounting for 36.41 percent of the region's economic output. But a dramatic leap was observed in the industry sector, which grew from 8.13 percent in 2000 to 24.65 percent in 2021 in terms of percentage share. This, however, does not indicate that the AFF has been weakening for the past years. This only indicates that the region is heading towards a balanced economy with the three main sectors moving and contributing significantly to the region's economic output.

### Figure 1.1 GRDP Percent Share, by sector, BARMM, 2000 vs. 2021

**2000:**
- Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing: 55.75%
- Industry: 8.13%
- Services: 36.12%

**2021:**
- Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing: 38.94%
- Industry: 24.65%
- Services: 36.41%

### Historic drop in the incidence of poverty in BARMM

Poverty incidence in the region dropped from 54.20 percent (or 380,000 families) in 2018 to only 29.80 percent (or 230,000 families) in 2021. Despite this historic drop, poverty incidence in the region remains to be the highest in the country.

The massive drop in poverty in the region can be attributed to the double-digit percentage drop in Lanao del Sur, Sulu, Basilan, and Maguindanao. It was only the province of Tawi-Tawi that registered an increase in poverty incidence in the region.

### Figure 1.2 Poverty Incidence by Region, 2018 vs. 2021

| Region | 2018 | 2021 |
|---|---|---|
| BARMM | 54.20% | 29.80% |

### Recovery of tourism and investments from the ill-effects of the pandemic

The pandemic put the tourism sub-sector on a standstill in 2020, causing tourist arrivals to drop to as low as 7,332. But renewed confidence and interest was recorded in 2021 when tourist arrivals grew by more than a thousand-fold, which was 195,822. However, despite the monumental increase in 2021, the number is still far below as compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2018 and 2019.

Investments plummeted from Php4.153 billion in 2019 to only Php14.0 million in 2020 due to the restrictions caused by the pandemic. Though still in the pandemic stage, investments rose to Php2.8 billion in 2021, more than a thousand-fold increase as compared to 2020. Total investments generated from 2019 to 2021 reached Php6.970 billion, which generated 5,020 jobs.

### A gradual shift towards formalization among the MSMEs

In 2021, a total of 8,427 micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) have been registered - a 161.46 percent increase from the number in 2020. It is the highest in a span of five years. Such an increase was a manifestation of the resilience of the Bangsamoro entrepreneurs given the lingering effects of the pandemic.

For two years (2020-2021), BARMM has registered 11,650 businesses through its five provincial offices including Cotabato City, created 31,000 jobs and generated an investment of around Php2.5 billion.

Despite the significant increase in business name registrations (BNR) in 2021, BARMM registered the lowest BNRs in the country, accounting for only 0.92 percent.

### Gains in peace and security

Crime-related incidents, deaths, and displacement dropped to a record low during the transition. However, land conflicts intensified in selected areas in 2020, and rido-related incidents persisted at the time of the pandemic. These, however, did not affect the overall regional stability. Generally, there is relative peace and security in the region during the transition period.

Threats to violent extremism remain endemic in selected localities, and challenges to pernicious shadow economies such as illicit firearms and illegal drug trade remain significant and require immediate attention and action in terms of policy and local support.

### Challenges in education and health outcomes remain impervious

Education performance outcomes in the region are still lowest in the country, and these have been further exacerbated by the pandemic. There was a significant learning loss in 2020 and 2021 as restrictions were imposed to protect the learners. A total of 143 barangays are considered school-less, and thousands of Madrasahs remain unaccredited, implying limited access to government support.

Access to public hospitals, rural health units (RHUs), barangay health stations (BHSs), and medical practitioners remains limited in the region, causing high rates of maternal mortality, infant mortality, and morbidity rates. Nutrition is also a gap, as the region registered the highest malnutrition rate. Access to basic safe water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities is the lowest in the country, explaining the high stunting rate and morbidity rate among children.

### Increasing vulnerability to the effects of climate change

The region is increasingly becoming vulnerable to natural calamities, particularly flooding in low-lying areas, resulting in deaths, displacement, and loss of properties. The typhoon "Paeng" which hit the country on October 28, 2022 caused flooding and landslides, resulting in 61 deaths and homes covered in mud. The casualty in the region was the highest in the country.

## BARMM Institutional Context

### The birth of a new political entity

The passage of RA No. 11054 "An Act Providing for the Organic Law for the BARMM, repealing for the purpose RA No. 6734 as amended by RA No. 9054, entitled 'An Act to Strengthen and Expand the Organic Act for the ARMM,'" paved the way for the establishment of a new political entity. On July 27, 2018, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte signed it into law, and was ratified through a plebiscite in early 2019. The ratification of RA No. 11054, also known as the BOL, commenced the transition of the defunct ARMM into the BARMM, a new autonomous regional government.

### A shift in the system of governance

The birth of this new political entity was confronted with various challenges, specifically with changes in government structure and political leadership. A unitary system of governance was adopted by the ARMM government. However, with the change of political entity through the ratification of the BOL, the Bangsamoro government is currently adopting a parliamentary system of governance in running the BARMM. Indeed, birthing pains in establishing this new political entity are being endured by the Bangsamoro government, which started with the shifting of the system of governance during the transition of the ARMM to BARMM.

### Transitioning from ARMM to BARMM, the appointment of interim officers, and the execution of powers

As stated in Article XVI, Section 1 of RA No. 11054, the transition period for the establishment of the BARMM commenced upon the ratification of the BOL. BARMM seeks to foster genuine autonomy, moral governance, and improve fiscal management in the region. However, the transition from ARMM to BARMM is a very significant change that brings enormous challenges to the Bangsamoro government.

Following the ratification of the BOL was the creation of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) as the interim government in the BARMM, holding both legislative and executive powers during the transition period.

President Rodrigo R. Duterte appointed Ahod B. Ebrahim as the interim Chief Minister of the Bangsamoro government, bearing the executive power and authority over the region, while Atty. Pangalian M. Balindong was appointed as the BTA Parliament Speaker along with the other members of the Parliament holding the legislative power and authority in the BARMM.

Thereafter, Chief Minister Ahod B. Ebrahim submitted to the BTA Parliament a transition plan last June 17, 2019, that served as the initial basis and guide for the organizational plan, schedule of phasing out of employees, and other transition mechanisms of the six priority codes. The proposed transition plan was voted on by the majority of the Members of Parliament, and thus, approved by the BTA Parliament. With its approval, the Bangsamoro government began organizing the interim Cabinet, but the implementation of the transition plan affected the usual government operations, which hampered the delivery of services across the region. On the other hand, the transition period shall end upon the dissolution of the BTA as provided in the BOL.

### Phasing out of ARMM offices, separation of ARMM personnel, and transfer of powers and properties

The commencement of the transition signaled a full transfer of powers, functions, and properties of the ARMM government to the BARMM government, except for those properties, land, and structures located outside the ARMM. All ARMM offices were deemed abolished upon ratification of the BOL, resulting in the reorganization of the bureaucracy. The Bangsamoro government was able to implement the gradual phasing out of employees. However, this also caused a minimal disruption in the continuity of government services.

Further, the disposition and separation from government service also brought confusion to the majority of ARMM personnel. Nevertheless, the Bangsamoro government executed Section 10, Article XVI of RA No. 11054 which states that "All affected personnel who will not be absorbed in the positions of the new staffing pattern of the different offices in the Bangsamoro government, whether hired on a permanent, temporary, casual, or contractual basis and with appointments attested by the Civil Service Commission (CSC), shall be entitled to applicable retirement or separation benefits as provided in this Organic Law." Therefore, retired and separated ARMM personnel were given due compensation for the services they had rendered to the government.

In consideration of the public interest and continuity in the delivery of services, ARMM officials holding appointive positions were retained to continue performing their functions in accordance with the phase-out schedule. Despite retaining those officials, most of the offices faced difficulties especially with the technical and field operations because many employees from the defunct ARMM were not retained nor absorbed by their office.

Meanwhile, the employees coming from the sectors of health, education, and social welfare have been absorbed and transferred to the Bangsamoro government.

### Organization of bureaucracy—merging, restructuring, and creation of new offices in the BARMM

Even being guided by the transition plan, the merging and restructuring of offices connotes major changes in operations and services. The mandates of the offices being merged and restructured became bigger, yet the number of employees did not equate to the number of jobs to be done to effectively implement the mandate of the merged offices.

Among the merged and restructured offices are the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education (MBHTE), Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Agrarian Reform (MAFAR), Ministry of Trade, Investments, and Tourism (MTIT), Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources, and Energy (MENRE), and Ministry of Finance and Budget and Management (MFBM).

### Hiring of new BARMM personnel

With the organization of the new bureaucracy, the BTA has established an independent, strictly merit-based and credible placement and hiring process in all BARMM MOAs. The Bangsamoro Job Portal—an online platform where all applicants have equal opportunity to apply for any vacant positions in different ministries, offices, and agencies of the Bangsamoro government—was established.

As of December 2022, the Bangsamoro government received more than 600,000 job applications for around 7,725 positions posted on the Bangsamoro Job Portal. Aside from the plantilla posted in the job portal, there are thousands of job orders and contracts of services in different MOAs that are not posted in the said portal. This high volume of hopefuls vying for a position in the BARMM was overwhelming as it reflected their desire to be part of the Bangsamoro government.

Given this figure, the Bangsamoro government was receiving a backlash from the public, particularly from the applicants who were inquisitive about the hiring process. Currently, most of the vacant and available positions posted in the portal were already filled up.

### Inclusion of Cotabato City and SGA to the BARMM

Following the passage and ratification of the BOL, Cotabato City and SGA formed part of the Bangsamoro territory after they favorably voted for inclusion in the BARMM during the plebiscite.

The Bangsamoro government faced challenges in the inclusion of these areas in the regional planning and budgeting processes due to delays in the formal turnover of these areas to BARMM and perceived resistance of the City Government of Cotabato pending the decision for the protest they filed before the Supreme Court.

However, the Bangsamoro government was able to surpass these concerns through the issuance of an Executive Order (EO) issued by the Chief Minister on January 20, 2020, creating the Development Coordinating Office (DCO) tasked to administer the planning and implementation of PPAs of the MOAs in the SGA.

Further, Cotabato City officially became part of the BARMM on December 15, 2020 after a formal turnover of the supervision of Cotabato City to BARMM by the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Central Office.

## The BARMM extended transition

President Duterte signed on October 28, 2021 the law extending the transition period of BARMM from 2022 to 2025, thereby postponing the first regional parliamentary elections in the region. RA No. 11593 stipulates that the first parliamentary elections shall be held and synchronized with the 2025 national elections. It also stipulates that the BTA shall continue as the interim government during the extension of the transition period and the President may appoint the 80 new members of the BTA, who shall serve up to June 30, 2025 or until their successors shall have been elected. The BTA will continue to be MILF-led.

## The 2nd BDP 2023-2028

### Legal Basis

As the 1st BDP is now in its final term, the Office of the Chief Minister issued Memorandum Order No. 0092, directing all heads of ministries, offices, and agencies for the formulation of the 2nd BDP, Results Matrices (RM), and the Bangsamoro Development and Investment Program (BDIP) for 2023-2028. The 2nd BDP is envisioned to sustain the gains and pursue the development direction, priorities, and strategies outlined in the 1st BDP.

The formulation of the 2nd BDP commenced with the conduct of a rigorous review and assessment of the 12-Point Priority Agenda and the 1st BDP 2020-2022. The assessment findings and recommendations served as guideposts in the design of the 2nd BDP process.

### Approach

A whole-sector approach was adopted in the planning process. The five BEDC sectoral committees and special committee were the mechanisms tapped in the four phases of the planning process. The BPDA as the technical secretariat of the BEDC was instrumental in ensuring that the sectoral and special committees were mobilized in crafting the strategic directions of their respective sectors and assigned chapters.

### Cross-cutting themes

While moral governance is the overarching guiding principle, this is being operationalized in the 2nd BDP in terms of inclusion, equity, and justice. These three elements served as the cross-cutting themes and, to some extent, the guiding principles in crafting the strategic directions of the five sectors of the 2nd BDP.

### Planning Standards and Principles

**Building on the gains.** There was a recognition that key results, particularly outcomes, and the corresponding strategies in the 1st BDP are still relevant and significant for adoption in the 2nd BDP 2023-2028.

**BOL as the policy anchor.** The stipulations in the BOL served as the policy framework of the strategic directions in each of the sectors. As the framework, it provides the coverage or the limits in terms of rights, powers, and authority to exercise and the mechanisms and systems to create.

**Moral governance as the guidepost.** Moral governance continues to be the guidepost in terms of leadership and overall service delivery, but this will be operationalized through its cross-cutting themes of inclusion, equity, and justice for the next six years.

**Vertical and horizontal alignment.** There was a deliberate effort to ensure that the 2nd BDP was vertically aligned to the SDG, 8-point Socioeconomic Agenda of the Marcos administration, PDP 2023-2028, and the Mindanao Development Agenda. Coordination meetings were conducted with NEDA Central Office and NEDA Regional Office (NRO) XII. Close coordination was also conducted with MinDA to ensure alignment with the Mindanao Development Agenda. The Bangsamoro Spatial Strategy was a byproduct of such close coordination.

In terms of horizontal alignment, it was ensured that the 2nd BDP was able to translate the priorities set in the enhanced 12-Point Priority Agenda into specific strategies and initiatives. In addition, the ranked priority list of projects reflected in the BDIP was based on the list in the 2nd BDP. The annual priorities in the BDIP will be the basis for the Annual Investment Program (AIP), which will serve as the basis for the General Appropriations Act for the Bangsamoro (GAAB).

Coordination was conducted with several ministries for the sectoral plans such as the Gender and Development (GAD) plan, Disaster Risk Reduction and Management - Climate Change Adaptation (DRRM-CCA) plan, Camps Transformation Plan (CTP), Bangsamoro Food Security and Nutrition (BFSN) plan, among others, to ensure its alignment in terms of results, strategies, and priority programs and projects.

**Evidence-based.** Data from the different agencies with the mandate to produce official estimates were used in formulating the sectoral profile and trends. Majority of the data were taken from the PSA and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). Data systems of agencies such as the Enhanced Basic Education Information System (EBEIS) of the MBHTE and the Field Health Services Information System (FHSIS) of the Ministry of Health (MOH) were key sources of data.

Various literatures were also used to ensure that claims are supported with research or scientific inquiry.

**Strategic or critical thinking.** One of the biggest investments of this planning process was strategy formulation because strategies are the direct link between results and initiatives. Several consultations and workshops were conducted to ensure that the strategies formulated were not only effective in addressing the "wicked" problems but also have multiplier or cascading effects. Strategies are the link between the desired result and the interventions. There will be no program that will be implemented that is not anchored to a strategy. The sectoral committees referred to the clusters in the objective tree and formulated a strategy. Each strategy should be able to address multiple critical issues in the problem tree.

**Inclusive and participatory.** Consultations with the provincial, municipal, city, and barangay LGUs, CSOs, academe, private sectors, and other stakeholders were also conducted for an inclusive and participatory planning. The five sectors were meaningfully engaged in problem analysis, target setting and strategy formulation, investment programming, and results-based monitoring and evaluation.

### Strategic shifts from the 1st BDP

**Setting targets.** A shift from point estimate to a range of values was undertaken in setting targets to accommodate internal and external shocks that are oftentimes beyond government or state control. In addition, annual average growth rates as opposed to annual growth rate were used because the sustained or long-term performance is more critical as opposed to a one-time or annual performance. Further, measures of inequality and severity have been added as indicators of performance.

**Defining accountabilities.** The notion of "objectives" is being introduced in the 2nd BDP. This is to make the distinction which accountabilities are at the sectoral level, the sub-sector level, and at the institutional level.

**Emphasis on strategy.** Strategy is treated as the unifying element as this is the direct link between targeted results and the initiatives. This implies that no program or project will be proposed and implemented that is not anchored to a development strategy. The strategies have been instrumental in promoting vertical and horizontal alignment. This also implies that regional strategies have to be at some points supporting international and national strategies. Likewise provincial, city, and municipal strategies have to be supporting regional strategies. Contextualization can be done in terms of programs and projects, but alignment at the strategy level must be pursued.

### Process

**Assessment of 12-Point Priority Agenda and the 1st BDP.** In anticipation to update the 12-Point Priority Agenda and the formulation of a successor plan of the 1st BDP, the BEDC sectoral committees started a series of assessment activities in January 2022.

**Issuance of memorandum.** Memorandum Circular No. 0092 was issued on May 16, 2022, directs the BEDC through its five sectoral committees to spearhead the 2nd BDP formulation process with assistance from the BPDA being the technical secretariat. The said memorandum also mandates the BEDC sectoral committees to initiate and draft the BDIP and the RM as accompanying documents.

**Situational analysis and problem analysis.** Several studies and assessment reports were used in formulating the sectoral profile and trends. The five BEDC sectoral committees underwent problem analysis using the Strength-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) analysis, Political-Economic-Sociological-Technological-Legal-Environmental (PESTLE), and the Problem Tree analysis as tools.

**Target setting and strategy formulation.** The five BEDC sectoral committees formulated the sectoral goals and objectives based on the Objective Tree analysis. The sectoral goal and objectives reflect the transformational results to be achieved by the end of 2028. This is supported by Indicator-Baseline-Target Matrix.

The biggest investment was strategy formulation because not only the strategies should be distinct from activities, but they should be able to demonstrate a cascading or broad-based effect. Strategies are the link between the desired result and the interventions. There will be no program that will be implemented that is not anchored to a strategy. The sectoral committees referred to the clusters in the objective tree and formulated a strategy. Each strategy should be able to address multiple critical issues in the problem tree.

**Investment programming.** The five BEDC sectoral committees underwent a rigorous prioritization process of projects using the Conflict-Compatibility-Complementarity Matrix, Urgency Test, and the Goal Achievement Matrix (GAM). The output was a ranked list of priority projects with individual and cumulative cost estimates. Stream 2 of investment programming was determining the investible funds and stream 3 delved into matching the fund requirements with projected funds available and deciding on financing options should the funds available are insufficient.

**Results-based monitoring and evaluation.** A Results Matrix (RM) was formulated that covers the full hierarchy of results with baseline, targets, and means of verification. The RM is being supported with a Performance Measurement System (PMS) to reflect the institutional accountabilities and arrangements.

**LGU consultations and validation.** Strategic directions reflected in the draft 2nd BDP were presented during the LGU consultations and validation workshops. These were participated by representatives of six provincial governments, three city governments, 75 municipal governments, 142 barangay governments, 49 CSOs, three academic institutions, five private sector organizations, and BARMM MOAs.

### Accompanying Documents

The 2nd BDP has three accompanying documents. These are:

**Bangsamoro Development Investment Program (BDIP).** The BDIP contains the list of priority programs and projects, financing options, and the development approach to be undertaken.

**Results Matrices (RM).** The RM presents the hierarchy of results with indicators and means of verification. It delineates levels of accountabilities at the sectoral level, sub-sector level, and at the institutional level.

**Bangsamoro Development Policy and Research Agenda (BDPRA).** The BDPRA contains a detailed accounting of policy research requirements that have to be pursued within the term of the 2nd BDP. It guides how the enabling environment can be further enhanced to push the reforms forward.

# Chapter 2: Regional trends and prospects for development

The next six years will hold several challenges for the BARMM as it navigates a critical transition period until 2025, while attempting to sustain the dividends of peace amidst tackling the hurdles brought by COVID-19 and the broader development challenges.

Several trends and developments at the global and regional levels have and may affect the region as well. It is therefore imperative that the Bangsamoro government takes these current and emerging trends into account when charting its development directions for the next six years.

As the BARMM works towards achieving an empowered, cohesive, and progressive Bangsamoro, it will have to strategically navigate through the political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental landscapes.

#### 7.9 million more people in BARMM by 2030, with the greatest increase in Lanao del Sur

BARMM's population is projected to reach 5,250,500 by 2030. This indicates a 1,986,400 increase in the population of the region in ten years.

### Table 2.3 BARMM Projected Population 2010-2030

| REGION | 2010 | 2015 | 2020 | 2025 | 2030 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Philippines | 93,135,100 | 101,562,300 | 109,947,900 | 117,959,400 | 125,337,500 |

*Source: PSA, 2010 Census-Based Population Projections*

Throughout the projection period (2010-2030), the population of the six provinces of BARMM would continue to increase, albeit at a slower rate. Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao del Norte and del Sur, and Sulu will contain more than 1 million people and have the largest populations by 2030, with 1.5 million, 1.4 million, and 1.1 million persons, respectively, by 2030. Populations of Tawi-Tawi and Basilan are expected to reach 588,500 and 497,900, respectively, in the said period.

#### Projected rapid growth of the working-age population

Overall, the projected population in BARMM from 2010 to 2030 will increase across broad age groups. Ages 0 to 14 will have a gradual but consistent growth in population over the projection period. By 2030, the number of people in this age group will increase to 1,843,400, a rise of approximately 457,000 individuals.

BARMM's working-age population (15-64 years old) is also expected to grow, reaching 3.2 million in 2030. This is an increase of 1.4 million people compared to 2010.

Moreover, the number of people in BARMM aged 65 and older is projected to expand four-fold, representing a jump from 53,500 individuals in 2010 to 202,200 in 2030. While the number of people within this age group is expected to increase continuously, it will not be able to keep up with the rapidly growing number of people of the working age. The number of women in BARMM between the ages of 15 and 49 is expected to show a consistent growth pattern, going from 838,000 in 2010 to 1,355,200 in 2030.

### Table 2.5 BARMM Projected Population by Selected Age Group, 2010-2030

| REGION | 2010 | 2015 | 2020 | 2025 | 2030 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pop 0-14 | 1,386,400 | 1,461,800 | 1,580,100 | 1,741,400 | 1,843,400 |
| Pop 15-64 | 1,824,200 | 2,173,900 | 2,517,600 | 2,839,600 | 3,204,900 |

*Source: PSA, 2010 Census-Based Population Projections*

Among the BARMM provinces, Lanao del Sur is projected to register the largest increase in the working-age population by 2030, growing from 512,100 in 2010 to 941,900. Maguindanao comes next and is projected to gain 913,600 in its working-age population throughout the projection period, followed by Sulu at 686,200.

Tawi-Tawi and Basilan are expected to experience slow but steady growth. Approximately 364,900 people will be working-age in Tawi-Tawi by 2030 from 210,500 in 2010. Over the next 20 years, Sulu will gain 264,900 people aged 15-64 years, growing from 421,300 in 2010 to 686,200 in 2030.

### Prospects

#### Reaping the demographic dividend

BARMM is well positioned for accelerated economic growth and social development as a result of the high percentage of its population in the working age group (15-64 years old) in 2020. The population projections (2010 to 2030) also signify the potential for BARMM to reap a demographic dividend.

The region's economic growth potential will likely be very high if this projected population growth is realized, especially for the working-age population, as there will be a greater number of people in the workforce relative to the number of dependents.

To reap the full benefits of a favorable age distribution, the Bangsamoro government must invest further in human capital development by assuring access to health care and quality education for all ages, as well as increasing opportunities for productive employment and decent labor.

## Political

### Trends

#### New leadership making headways

The Bangsamoro government is confronted with enormous challenges in setting up the necessary structures, processes, and mechanisms to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of services to the Bangsamoro. With a complex transition process, combined with the compounding effects of COVID-19, tackling the region's development challenges is doubly difficult for BARMM as a fledgling government.

Building a bureaucracy is not an easy task; however, the Bangsamoro government has been making significant strides in institution building. The Bangsamoro government has doubled its efforts to operationalize the newly established offices and fill key positions within the government. Subsequently, developing the capacities of new civil servants and newly established institutions will be a high priority for the new leadership. This is a critical component of this effort to cultivate effective public service.

#### Moral governance as an instrumentality for inclusion, equity, and justice

It has been a central component of the Bangsamoro government's efforts to create a more empowered, cohesive, and progressive Bangsamoro that has always put moral governance as a critical underpinning principle to ensure inclusivity, equity, and justice within the Bangsamoro.

#### Shift in the system of governance

The birth of this new political entity faced various challenges. Most notably, changes in government structures and political leadership. The ARMM adopted a unitary government system. However, with the change in political entity following the ratification of the BOL, the Bangsamoro government has adopted a parliamentary system in running the BARMM. As mentioned above, the Bangsamoro government is continuously strengthening its effort in establishing this new political structure.

#### Policy support in relation to fiscal autonomy in-place

According to Section 1, Article XII of the BOL, "The Bangsamoro Government shall enjoy fiscal autonomy with the end in view of attaining economic self-sufficiency and genuine development." This means that the Bangsamoro government has the power to create its own sources of revenue in addition to the equitable share in the national taxes from the national government and block grant and prepare its budget and allocate this revenue within the bounds of the BOL. The Bangsamoro government has now the power to pass annual regional appropriations law through the Parliament in accordance with the needs and priorities of the region.

Through the annual block grant, the national government can automatically provide a sum equal to 5 percent of the net national internal revenue tax collections generated by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and the Bureau of Customs (BOC). This is the fiscal autonomy granted to the Bangsamoro government to control over its appropriations.

In addition to the annual block grant, the Bangsamoro government's taxing powers have also been expanded. It shall have the power to levy taxes, fees, and charges, but are subject to provisions of the Organic Law. Other than tariff and customs duties, the Bangsamoro government shares in national government taxes, fees, and charges collected in the BARMM are increased to 75 percent, inclusive of the shares of its constituent LGUs.

#### LGUs' functionality and performance demonstrating progress

During the start of a transition of leadership from ARMM to BARMM, LGUs' functionality was recorded at 45 percent (or 56 LGUs) of the 123 LGUs in ARMM. The Ministry of Interior and Local Government (MILG) has strategized its implementation of PPAs that include the giving of incentives to performing local governments. The tool used by the ministry was the Performance Audit and Compliance Tracking System (PACTS).

In 2021, the functionality rate jumped to 80 percent, which is equivalent to 98 LGUs. This remarkable increase shows that the strategy of incentivizing the performing LGUs is a good way of enticing others to do the same. Incentives were given in the form of a project amounting to Php1.5 million. A menu of projects was also given for the performing LGUs to choose from such as support to social, education, revenue generation, and disaster-related projects.

The ministry treated it as its regular program that serves as a support mechanism to the Seal of Good Local Governance (SGLG) being implemented by the DILG. The BARMM recorded 28 LGUs as passers in the prestigious search for SGLG, making the region ranked 1st out of the six regions in Mindanao and ranked 3rd out of 17 regions in the Philippines that passed and awarded with SGLG.

### Prospects

#### The Bangsamoro Electoral Code and democratic process in BARMM

There is much anticipation about the passage of the Bangsamoro Electoral Code, which is perceived to pave the way for a more democratic and credible system of electoral processes in BARMM to ensure genuine, credible, free, open, and honest elections.

#### Towards a more stable and stronger bureaucracy

In the coming years, BARMM will be seeing a stable and stronger governance system with the amount of progress made and the continuing effort to build and strengthen the bureaucracy.

#### Policy support to harness revenue generation needed

BARMM's revenue generation capacity will be boosted by the passage of the Bangsamoro Revenue Code. It shall cover the taxing powers of the Bangsamoro government. The BARMM is optimistic that this Code will act as a catalyst for boosting revenue collection and enhancing the overall revenue generation, thereby contributing to the improvement of the quality of the delivery of services in the region.

#### Well-defined relationship between BARMM and its constituent LGUs

The Bangsamoro Local Government Code shall strengthen the supervisory powers of the Bangsamoro government through the MILG and provide clear guidance on the relationship between the Bangsamoro government and its constituent LGUs.

Through this proposed Code, it is expected that the Bangsamoro government will develop a more responsive and accountable local governments in the region.

#### Implementation of the Mandanas-Garcia ruling poses opportunities and challenges

The implementation of the Mandanas-Garcia ruling in BARMM will equip LGUs with more resources to implement its devolved functions. However, the implementation should be accompanied with a range of capacity development support in terms of the structure, policies, skills, mechanisms, and systems and processes.

#### Strong support of national government and international development partners

The BARMM is strongly supported by the national government and international development partners in its efforts for institutionalization and socioeconomic development. Their assistance has significant contribution in BARMM's efforts toward a peaceful transition.

The national government has been a major player in the process of achieving long-term peace in the BARMM. Peace dividends have been sustained due to the joint efforts of the GPH and the MILF. The ongoing decommissioning of MILF combatants, which is one of the key provisions of the Annex on Normalization of the CAB, is a specific indication of strengthened partnership between the GPH and the MILF.

The development partners have also played an important role as knowledge and resource brokers, allowing the BARMM to bring together relevant stakeholders from the international, national, and local levels to promote sustainable and inclusive peace and development in the Bangsamoro region. The Bangsamoro government was heavily supported by development partners in charting its development direction through their assistance during BARMM's delicate transition. Also, the development partners have contributed in the region's response and recovery efforts to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Economic

### Trends

#### Second fastest-growing economy in the country

The ARMM experienced the highest economic growth in 2017, registered at 10.1 percent. However, the region's economic performance decelerated in 2018 and 2019 at 7.7 percent and 5.8 percent, respectively. Though the economy of ARMM was growing, the region had the lowest contribution to the overall economic output of the country due to the nature of its economic base, being a producer of raw materials.

According to the PSA, the economy of the BARMM decelerated from a positive rate in 2019 of 5.8 percent to -1.9 percent in 2020. However, the regional economy strongly recovered in 2021, registering a 7.5 percent increase, the second highest growth rate in the country. The region's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate was mainly fueled by AFF at 8.3 percent, industry at 7.9 percent, and services at 6.6 percent.

However, it should be noted that BARMM, which is still in transition, continues to make minimal economic contribution despite its positive economic development. The region's share of the national economy averaged at 1.0 percent between 2010 and 2018, making it the smallest region's share of the country's overall economic performance.

#### Bigger role of industry and services

Over the last two decades, structural changes have been observed. In 2021, the services sector replaced AFF as the leading sector, accounting for 36.40 percent of the region's overall economic output. The industry sector has also seen a dramatic rise from 8.13 percent in 2000 to 24.70 percent in 2021.

However, this does not mean that the AFF has weakened in recent years. AFF remains to be one of the most important sub-sectors in the economic sector. It played a major role in the economic resiliency of the region at the time of the pandemic. It remains to be the main source of food, employment, and income of most of the Bangsamoro households. This only indicates that the region is heading towards a balanced economy. Industry and services are now playing a bigger role and contribute significantly to the region's economic output.

#### Idle land assets and untapped tourism and investment potentials

BARMM sees numerous opportunities to revitalize the region's economy, owing to its abundant natural resources and diverse rural topography, which includes vast tracts of fertile land and marine resources. BARMM is also endowed with natural landscapes and environment, beaches, historical landmarks, and sceneries comparable to known tourist destinations in the Philippines. It has a wide range of flora and fauna, pristine white sandy-beaches, crystalline spring water and towering waterfalls, and a variety of tourist attractions.

Due to this competitive advantage, the Bangsamoro region is viewed as a viable source for producing goods or services at a lower opportunity cost than its trading counterparts. A growing tourism industry is also emerging in BARMM. The Bangsamoro government is making unprecedented investments in tourism. The opening of an inter-regional airline route between Cotabato City and Bongao in Tawi-Tawi province marks an important milestone in promoting tourism in the region.

### Prospects

#### Agriculture development to move at a faster rate

The AFF sector is expected to grow at a faster rate as more lands will be opened for agricultural investments and industry players will have better access to technology, market information, and government support.

#### Expanding industry and services sectors

Construction, real estate, trade, tourism, and investment are perceived as the sunrise industries in the region as the gains in the peace process and overall regional stability will boost investors' confidence.

#### Halal industry growing and expanding markets

Halal industry development is viewed as a very promising investment opportunity. The BARMM is a potential market for Halal-compliant products due to its large Muslim population. The region is also geographically well-situated due to its proximity to most major cities in Mindanao, its access to international maritime routes, and its strategic location along the Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) trade corridor.

#### Islamic finance as a component driver of socioeconomic development

The pursuit of an operational and functional Islamic finance system in the Philippines remains as important and urgent. The current financial system, which is still largely fueled by interest-based and conventional transactions and instruments, does not conform to the needs, identity, aspirations, and way of life of the Bangsamoro.

With this, some Bangsamoro and other Muslim Filipinos were not able to participate in the financial system as exemplified by the very low rate of financial inclusion across the region. This means that a vast number of constituents in the BARMM are excluded from accessing useful and affordable financial products and services that are supposed to meet their needs and improve their overall quality of life.

Cognizant of the pressing need to provide an alternative financial system that is responsive to the needs and aspirations of the Bangsamoro, and recognizing the importance of establishing Islamic finance as a component driver of socioeconomic development, the OCM issued Memorandum Circular No. 0012 in 2021 creating a technical working group for Islamic finance in the BARMM. It primarily aims to develop a roadmap for the comprehensive promotion and development of Islamic finance in the region. This was followed by the issuance of Joint Circular dated 26 April 2022 and a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) dated 04 May 2022 between the Bangsamoro government, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMEF), and the Department of Finance on establishing the Shari'ah Supervisory Board in the BARMM.

In creating the enabling environment for the Islamic finance industry, the Bangsamoro government develops the roadmap for the promotion and development of Islamic finance in the region. It offers a workable and grounded framework intended mainly to serve as a guide in designing the region's Islamic finance development and strategic pathways in a manner that supports and fits seamlessly into bigger socioeconomic development trajectories and objectives. It also lays the foundations for the continuing and sustainability-oriented directions for stakeholders, industry, and inter-governmental dialogue, cooperation, and collaboration.

As part of its holistic approach, the roadmap's strategic thrusts are designed for the Islamic financial services providers, consumers and end users, government regulators, and environment enablers. This translates to interventions that will establish and institutionalize Islamic banks, Islamic microfinance, Islamic pawn brokering or "ar-rahnu", Islamic insurance or "takaful", and the Islamic capital market. Moreover, "zakah", "waqf", and "hajj" financing are important complementary industries and services to the overall development of an Islamic finance ecosystem. Cross-cutting strategies will include the development of human capital, and institutional, regulatory, and market environment.

#### Tighter BIMP-EAGA economic integration

The economic integration through the BIMP-EAGA opens up opportunities for trade and investment. Advancing BARMM's integration in the BIMP-EAGA trade window has been regarded as a means of stimulating its development as a strategic player, as well as increasing its economic competitiveness within Mindanao and the BIMP-EAGA region.

In June 2022, the MinDA and the Bangsamoro government through the BPDA inked a Memorandum of Cooperation aimed at fostering stronger partnership and collaboration to scale up efforts towards more robust participation of BARMM in the BIMP-EAGA and other Mindanao development initiatives. This collaboration is also seen as advancing long-term peace and development across Mindanao and BARMM.

To pursue this integration to the BIMP-EAGA, the BARMM and the national government must promote sustainable and competitive cross-border trading and trade investments, increase strategic infrastructure including digital connectivity, develop value chains for priority commodities with high trade and processing potential, mainstream sustainable and climate-resilient resource management, and strengthen partnerships for knowledge exchange and capacity building.

## Social

### Trends

#### Low human development index but gradual improvement in accessing health and education services

BARMM has the lowest human development index (HDI) in the country, particularly on the performance outcomes in the areas of health and education as well as standard of living. The HDI for BARMM was the lowest of all the regions in 2017. BARMM's score on HDI in 2019 was categorized as medium human development, which is also the lowest in the Philippines. The three provinces with the lowest HDI or low human development in the country are all from BARMM namely, Sulu, Maguindanao, and Lanao del Sur.

#### Historic drop in poverty but remains to be the highest in the country

Poverty remains a major challenge in the region. Poverty incidence in the ARMM continues to rise from 55.8 percent in 2012 to 53.7 percent in 2015. Among the regions of the country, ARMM registered the highest poverty incidence at 61.3 percent in 2018. This rate is almost four times the national poverty incidence posted at 16.6 percent in 2018. The three provinces of the ARMM namely, Sulu, Basilan, and Lanao del Sur, were among the poorest provinces in the country in 2018.

BARMM's poverty incidence plummeted to 29.80 percent in 2021 as compared to 54.20 percent in 2018. However, this rate is still high when compared to the national poverty incidence posted at 23.7 percent in 2021.

#### Gains in overall regional peace and security but threats remain a concern

In recent years, the region has seen sporadic violence, particularly in relation to horizontal armed conflicts like clan feuds/"rido" and other forms of violence such as organized crime, and gender-based violence, among others. There is still a threat to the region's peace, public order, and security. Therefore, strategic efforts to prevent and counter violent extremism, formation of private armies, rise in number of crimes, and other types of threat and violence in the region should remain a top priority.

In addition, efforts to build peace should be directed toward addressing the causes and factors that contribute to instability to lessen the likelihood of the occurrence of violent conflict. COVID-19 also came at a critical time in BARMM's transition period, adding another layer of challenges to the Bangsamoro government's peacebuilding efforts.

#### Normalization process has been sluggish

In 2014, the MILF and the GPH reached a peace deal through the signing of the CAB. Normalization is an important component of the peace process as outlined in the CAB. The Annex on Normalization defines normalization as the process by which communities can attain their desired quality of life, including sustainable livelihood and political participation within a peaceful deliberative society.

Little progress has been observed in the implementation of the normalization process and its essential components, including but not limited to the deployment of peacekeeping teams to bolster conflict mitigation efforts, Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC), the decommissioning of MILF combatants, and confidence building measures such as amnesty and pardon and transformation of the six MILF-acknowledged camps into peaceful and productive communities.

There was a relatively positive start to the normalization process, but COVID-19 has significantly slowed it down over the past years. Efforts to reintegrate former combatants have been hindered by the pandemic by limiting the already scarce funding for Normalization and restricting the mobility of implementers, particularly in the implementation of the socioeconomic programs for decommissioned MILF members and their communities.

#### Camp transformation has yet to be realized but will soon get underway

Camp transformation, a critical aspect of Normalization as noted above, has so far remained largely unfulfilled. In spite of this, a funding mechanism has already been established to support the process of normalization, so it will be possible to move forward with the implementation phase in the following months.

The Bangsamoro Normalization Trust Fund (BNTF), which had its official launch in 2021 will finance, coordinate, and oversee the delivery of assistance from international partners and other donors during the implementation of the normalization process. This assistance will primarily be used for development efforts as well as the rehabilitation, reconstruction, and development of Bangsamoro communities, particularly six previously acknowledged MILF Camps (Abubakar, Omar, Badre, Rajamuda, Bushra, and Bilal), as well as vulnerable sectors across BARMM.

#### Recovery in COVID-19 pandemic

BARMM is not immune to the negative repercussions of COVID-19, especially since the pandemic has struck at a critical juncture in the region's transition period. While the region is still reeling from the negative effects of the pandemic, BARMM is also addressing the challenges brought on by the transition period. COVID-19 has posed a direct challenge to the peace and development in the region by straining the Bangsamoro government's peacebuilding efforts, driving up competition for scarce resources in localities with historical tension, and shifting institutional focus away from building inclusive policies during the formative stage of the region's new administrative apparatus.

The BARMM, like the rest of the Philippines, has been developing strategies to recover faster from the COVID-19 pandemic and address the substantial disruptions it caused. As part of the Bangsamoro Response and Recovery Plan (BRRP) on COVID-19 (2020-2022), the Bangsamoro government outlined critical strategies, including how the government will mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, facilitate adaptation to a new normal, and support gradual socioeconomic recovery over the three years.

As stated in the BRRP, the Bangsamoro government will encourage a whole-of-government approach as well as the convergence of efforts in the implementation of priority PPAs such as intensification of health-care services, strengthening social protection mechanisms, improving livelihood support, sustaining the food supply-chain, ensuring continuity of educational opportunities, and improving the region's adaptive capacity to the current crisis, among others.

### Prospects

#### Significant improvements in education and health performance

Access to education and health services is expected to improve significantly due to greater public investments in education and health and improved capacities of the MBHTE, MOH, and LGUs. Improved research capacities, particularly the use of data, will result in the deliberate targeting of unserved and underserved communities.

#### Declining trend in poverty

Two years have passed since COVID-19 swept the globe, but the pandemic is by no means over. COVID-19 is as much a social and economic crisis as it is a health crisis, yet one thing is certain: it has affected all segments of society with the most severe consequences falling on the marginalized and vulnerable. As we have witnessed, COVID-19 has disproportionately affected the poor and vulnerable who have borne the brunt of the damage.

Our government's efforts to combat poverty have been hampered by COVID-19. According to a study conducted by the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), the pandemic would make it more difficult for the Philippines to reduce poverty and return to its pre-pandemic growth path. But despite this setback, the implementation of poverty alleviation programs has continued, and our government has been ensuring that services were delivered to the basic sectors during the pandemic.

In the case of BARMM, poverty reduction is the most important success story in the region. All of the BARMM government's efforts to reduce poverty are starting to bear fruit, despite the challenges that have been brought about by the region's transition, as well as the pandemic's compounded effects. It is remarkable to note that the BARMM has seen a huge decrease in poverty incidence over the last three years, from 54.20 percent in 2018 to 29.8 percent in 2021. Thus, the region recorded the greatest percentage drop among the regions in the Philippines.

In spite of achieving this significant milestone, BARMM still has the highest poverty incidence among the regions in the country. This entails that the region must scale-up its efforts to ensure that anti-poverty programs and interventions are holistic by means of integrating the necessary social protection components especially for those in need.

As BARMM moves forward with programs meant to hasten its socioeconomic recovery and maintain progress in poverty reduction and economic growth, it must mobilize a larger, whole-of-government and whole-of-society effort to ensure long-term economic growth, lasting peace, and sustainable development in the Bangsamoro.

#### Threats of violent extremism and land conflict remain a challenge but with stronger local government response and support

Violent extremism will continue to be a threat as long as the pernicious shadow economies remain significant in selected localities. However, it is expected that there will be local government response and support as a result of continuing institutional strengthening of the LGUs.

Land conflict is expected to continuously persist in the region in the next few years given the lack of enabling laws in terms of land governance. Thus, a stronger government support should be realized to resolve land conflicts.

#### Social protection will be efficiently and adequately delivered to internally displaced and marginalized communities

The continuing improvement of systems in the BARMM MOAs and the LGUs will result in the efficient and adequate provision of social protection to marginalized communities and internally displaced persons, particularly during emergencies. Technology will grow rapidly in the next few years, making it cheaper and more accessible to state actors and organizations for disaster response and recovery.

#### Madaris education will be strengthened and promoted in the BARMM

The importance of Madaris education in BARMM cannot be overstated. It is particularly important in the context of the Bangsamoro, which is a region that is in a country with a non-Muslim majority. Madaris education plays a vital role in preserving the Islamic faith and culture.

The passage of the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act (BAA) No. 18, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Education Code, is hoped to pave way for a Bangsamoro educational system that is relevant and responsive to the needs, ideals, and aspirations of the Bangsamoro people. More importantly, this Code is seen to strengthen the Madaris system.

As more traditional schools/Madrasahs get accredited and, in the process, getting more government support, Madaris education will be a potent pathway for accessing education in the BARMM. Therefore, there is a need for the Bangsamoro government to focus its efforts on adopting a curriculum for Madaris that is relevant and responsive to the needs and context of the Bangsamoro people.

## Technological

### Trends

#### Demand for high-quality digital connectivity

BARMM continues to face digital connectivity challenges, with inadequate information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure being one of the causes. There is a digital divide in terms of ICT access and utilization. Based on the results of the 2019 National ICT Survey, BARMM has the highest percentage of households without digital access and largest percentage of people who are not using computers among the regions in the Philippines recorded at 95.5 percent and 91.5 percent, respectively.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought this issue to the forefront by demonstrating the critical importance of digital connectivity in dealing with a crisis. The pandemic has revealed the realities that underpin our economies; limited internet connectivity means missing out on employment opportunities, education, health care, public services, as well as the power of information and digital transformation. This is particularly glaring in BARMM especially among the underprivileged and marginalized populations who lack access to computers and the internet.

### Prospects

#### Technology as a potent instrument to reduce inequity and address development challenges in BARMM

Technology is projected to be cheaper and more accessible in the next few years. It can be utilized to enhance the capability of BARMM MOAs to respond to disaster-stricken communities in an adequate and timely manner. Provision of social protection will also be rationalized through better targeting in the use of data and technology. A more important advantage of technology is the ability to leverage it to promote transparent and accountable governance.

On the economic empowerment of the poor and vulnerable sectors, technology can be used to aid farmers and fisherfolks to have better access to market information and in promoting resilient farming. With better access to technology, MSMEs can develop more competitive products and promote them more effectively. Players in the industry will also have the opportunity to access international markets and will have better access to innovations through technology.

In order to harness the potential of technology, BARMM must prioritize and increase budgetary support for digital infrastructure, including ICT, as well as research and innovation. Further, it is important to provide equal access to technology throughout BARMM, particularly to the geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas (GIDA).

#### E-Governance for efficient and effective service delivery

The Bangsamoro government focuses on e-governance in order to improve service delivery. As part of its efforts to strengthen local governance in the region, the Bangsamoro government is currently developing an innovative, citizen-centric service delivery system that fosters innovation. This entails enabling citizens to make use of the benefits of digital transformation via the application of technology for greater access to services and information. Hence, efforts have been focused on improving digital connectivity throughout the Bangsamoro region with the aim of bolstering e-governance.

## Legal

### Prospects

#### The passage of the remaining priority codes

The BTA strives to fast track the passage of priority codes that will aid in the overall development of BARMM. The delay in the passage of priority codes and other significant legislations is believed to have impeded the full realization of some development goals of the region. For instance, revenue generation in the region is a major development concern because of the delay in the passage of necessary legislation. Therefore, the BTA must enact the remaining priority codes, such as electoral, local governance, revenue, and indigenous peoples' rights before the end of the extended transition period.

#### Setting a legislative and policy agenda

For the next six years, it will be crucial for BARMM to set a legislative and policy agenda that will shape relevant and responsive policies and programmatic outcomes, both in the medium-term and in the long-term. As an important precursor to setting up this agenda, it would be necessary to ensure meaningful participation of all relevant stakeholders, particularly those from marginalized and disadvantaged communities, to achieve results that are inclusive and holistic. Additionally, the BARMM must ramp up its efforts to leverage research and evidence-based data to set the legislative and policy agenda for the BARMM.

## Environmental

### Trends

#### Climate change and increasing threat of environmental degradation

BARMM is vulnerable to natural disasters and effects of climate change. It has some of the highest risk indicators in the Philippines. BARMM's geographical location makes it vulnerable to natural disasters. Many of the areas in the region are situated in low lying areas and surrounded by water ways. The region's three mainland provinces, namely, the Maguindanao del Sur, Maguindanao del Norte, and Lanao del Sur are more susceptible to disasters like flooding and landslides.

Aside from this, illegal activities like illegal logging and deforestation have also put the region at risk, noting that the region has a total forest cover of 299,839 hectares. Many of the areas in the region have become more exposed to disaster as their protection is taken off due to illegal activities. Further, rapid commercialization and urbanization of many areas in the region has put it more at risk to disasters due to lack of proper planning and conversion of rivers, forest, and agricultural lands to commercial areas.

Climate change has exacerbated the effects of natural disaster. Among the effects of climate change is rising levels of water, rising temperature, and severe weather events. Rising level of water tide has caused frequent sea surge in the island provinces and the increase in water level causes submersion in some areas of the island provinces in the region. Also, the rising temperature has caused severe drought while severe weather events have caused frequent flooding and flood-induced landslides.

The recent onslaught of Typhoon Paeng (Nalgae) has drawn attention to the fact that typhoons and other natural disasters are becoming stronger due to climate change, resulting in more damages and casualties even in regions that are far from the eye of the typhoon, as in the case of BARMM.

### Prospects

#### Taking an all-of-government and all-of-society approach to CCA and DRRM

Taking into account the context of BARMM, which involves a confluence of man-made and natural disasters, an approach encompassing inter/intra-governmental and multi-sectoral integration shall be pursued. The Bangsamoro government shall also continue to leverage on the capacities of the CSOs to reinforce peacebuilding initiatives. Engaging and empowering CSOs is always central to the BARMM government's strategy in laying the groundwork for a peaceful transition.

Therefore, BARMM's disaster risk reduction and management and climate change adaptation (DRRM-CCA) should espouse a whole-of-government and a whole-of-society approach that underpins effective coordination and convergence of efforts among BARMM MOAs, as well as between the national government and the regional government.

#### Better monitoring, regulation, and supervision in managing environmental assets

The presence of enabling policies and the continuing improvement of systems using data, technology and innovation will equip key agencies such as the MENRE and the concerned LGUs to efficiently and effectively monitor and manage the utilization of environmental assets.

#### Strengthening BARMM's capacity to improve community resilience

The Bangsamoro government plays a critical role in the ability of the communities to recover from the ill-effects of climate change and human-induced shocks through prevention and mitigation, disaster preparedness, and improved disaster response, recovery, and rehabilitation. As the Bangsamoro government improves its systems and as communities gain better access to critical information, a manageable loss in time of emergencies is anticipated.

# Chapter 3: Bangsamoro Spatial Strategy

The Bangsamoro Spatial Strategy (BSS) sets the long-term direction for the development in the BARMM. This chapter introduces the BARMM's vast comparative advantages and potentials that determine the functional roles of its provinces, capital city, and special geographic area that will support and sustain economic development in the region. These functional roles shall support the expansion and emergence of new economies that will sustain economic growth and development across the region.

## Introduction

RA 11054 establishes the BARMM which is composed of the provinces of Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi; and the cities of Marawi, Lamitan, and Cotabato. In addition, 63 barangays from the province of North Cotabato, which is referred to as the Special Geographic Area (SGA), are also included in its territory.

With the ratification of RA 11550 through a plebiscite held on September 17, 2022, the province of Maguindanao is now divided into two: Maguindanao del Norte and Maguindanao del Sur.

## BARMM Profile

*   4,944,800 Million Population (Source: PSA Census, 2020)
*   32,953.01 sq.km. Land Area (Source: NAMRIA)
*   6 Provinces
*   3 Cities
*   116 Municipalities
*   2,590 Barangays

BARMM is the largest region in the Philippines in terms of land area with a total of 32,953.01 sq.km. It covers the 10.98 percent of the total land area of the Philippines which is 300,000 sq.km. It is composed of 6 provinces, 3 cities (1 independent component and 2 component cities), 116 municipalities, and 2,590 barangays. The city of Isabela, despite being part of Basilan, is not under the administrative jurisdiction of the region. Likewise, the SGA is also part of the BARMM as a result of the plebiscite conducted to ratify the BOL.

### Table 3.1 BARMM Land Area, 2018

## Regional Spatial Strategy

Agglomeration, Connectivity, and Vulnerability Reduction are the three key spatial strategy principles that are vital in the identification of the overall spatial strategy of the BARMM and basis for the assessment of the region's growth centers and functional roles.

### Agglomeration

Agglomeration in BARMM is mainly demonstrated by the hierarchy of settlements which reflects the pattern or structure of settlements laid down in the region. The spatial arrangement and distribution of existing settlement strata or services was based primarily on population size, function, degree of urbanization, and presence of economic and social services. In essence, the larger the population of a settlement, the larger the scale of activities, therefore, the greater opportunities for division of labor and specialization.

### Table 3.4 Hierarchy of Networks of Settlements

| Level | Role | Indicator Functions | Population |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Regional Growth Center | Major center that provides services to national and international companies. | Presence of international port, airport, commerce | 1,200,000 and above |
| Sub-regional Growth Center | Provide support services that serve beyond local boundaries | Presence of national airport, level 3 hospital, commerce, and national developers | 120,000 - 1,200,000 |
| Provincial center | Provincial services and administration | Presence of tertiary level education, level 2 hospital, commercial banks, commerce residential subdivision, auto repair shop, service forwarders, cable | 50,000 - 120,000 |
| Local center | Rural and agricultural services | Presence of food retail, secondary school, primary health care, bus terminal, lodging inn | 50,000 and below |

The urban centers in the BARMM have been classified as regional centers, sub-regional centers, provincial centers, and local centers.

### Table 3.5 BARMM Existing Network of Settlements

| Hierarchy | City and Municipality |
| :--- | :--- |
| Regional Center | Cotabato City* |
| Sub-regional Center | Marawi City, Lamitan*, Jolo*, Datu Odin Sinsuat*, Bongao*, Buluan* |
| Provincial Center | Parang, Upi, Wao, Malabang, Sultan Kudarat, Indanan, Maimbung, Parang, Siasi, Talipao. |
| Local Center | **Basilan:** Lantawan, Maluso, Sumisip, Tipo-Tipo, Tuburan, Akbar, Al-Barka, Hadji Mohammad Ajul, Ungkaya Pukan, Hadji Muhtamad, Tabuan-Lasa, **Maguindanao:** Ampatuan, Buldon, Datu Paglas, Datu Piang, Shariff Aguak, Matanog, Pagalungan, Kabuntalan, Talayan, South Upi, Barira, General Salipada K. Pendatun, Mamasapano, Pagagawan, Sultan Mastura, Datu Saudi Ampatuan, Datu Abdullah Sangki, Rajah Buayan, Datu Blah T. Sinsuat, Datu Anggal Midtimbang, Mangudadatu, Pandag, Northern Kabuntalan, Datu Hoffer Ampatuan, Shariff Saydona Mustapha. **Sulu:** Kalingalan Caluang, Luuk, Hadji Panglima Tahil, Old Panamao, Pangutaran, Tongkil, Panglima Estino, Lugus, Pandami, Omar. **Tawi-Tawi:** Panglima Sugala, Mapun, Simunul, Sitangkai, South Ubian, Tandubas, Languyan, Sapa-Sapa, Sibutu. **Lanao del Sur:** Balabagan, Balindong, Bayang, Binidayan, Bubong, Ganassi, Lumba-Bayabao, Madalum, Malabang, Marantao, Masiu, Piagapo, Poona Bayabao, Saguiaran, Tamparan, Taraka, Marogong, Maguing |

*Note: Did not meet the population criteria but considered regional and sub-regional centers because of the presence of services, and income class.*

In the existing hierarchy of settlements, Cotabato City serves as BARMM's Regional Center based on presence of services, and income class. Being one of the functional urban centers with high access to basic facilities and services, Cotabato City shall serve as the financial and commercial hub. It connects to and serves as service center for provincial and local centers on major services such as financial, commercial, education, and health services as the current seat of the Bangsamoro government. Hence, it plays a critical role in linking strategic areas and business centers that are critical to trade and investments.

In 2050, there are 25 municipalities that will be elevated to sub-regional centers and 73 municipalities for provincial centers in terms of projected population as reflected in Table 3.6. All other municipalities in the region will play their role as local centers of their respective provinces.

Meanwhile, the proposed sub-regional centers will provide the services for its nearby provincial centers towards the realization of its functional roles as provided in Table 3.6.

### Table 3.6 BARMM Hierarchy of Settlements Based on Population Projection, 2050

| Province | Sub-Regional Center | Provincial Center | Local Center |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Maguindanao del Norte** | Datu Odin Sinsuat, Parang, Sultan Kudarat, Upi | Buldon, Matanog, Kabuntalan, Barira, Sultan Mastura, Datu Blah T. Sinsuat, Northern Kabuntalan | All other areas |
| **Maguindanao del Sur** | Buluan | Ampatuan, Datu Paglas, Talayan, Mangudadatu, Pandag, Guindulungan, Datu Saudi Ampatuan, Datu Abdullah Sangki, Rajah Buayan, Datu Anggal Midtimbang, Datu Hoffer Ampatuan, South Upi, Shariff Saydona Mustapha, Pagagawan, General Salipada K. Pendatun, Mamasapano, Sultan sa Barongis, Shariff Aguak, Datu Piang | All other areas |
| **Lanao del Sur** | Marawi, Wao, Malabang, Lumba-Bayabao | Balindong, Marantao, Piagapo, Saguiaran, Bacolod-Kalawi, Balabagan, Bayang, Binidayan, Bubong, Butig, Ganassi, Kapai, Lumbatan, Madalum, Madamba, Masiu, Tamparan, Taraka, Tugaya, Marogong, Maguing, Kapatagan | All other areas |
| **Basilan** | Hadji Mohammad Ajul, Lamitan | Maluso, Sumisip, Lantawan, Tipo-Tipo, Tuburan, Akbar, Al-Barka, Ungkaya Pukan, Hadji Muhtamad, Tabuan-Lasa | All other areas |
| **Sulu** | Jolo, Patikul, Talipao, Indanan, Kalingan Caluang, Luuk, Maimbang, Old Panamao, Parang, Siasi | Pata, Tapul, Lugus, Pandami, Omar, Pangutaran, Tongkil, Panglima Estino | All other areas |
| **Tawi-Tawi** | Bongao, Sitangkai, Languyan, Mapun, Sapa-Sapa, Sibutu, Simunul | Panglima Sugala, South Ubian, Tandubas | All other areas |

Moreover, Cotabato City will remain as the regional growth center of the region in 2050 with a projected population of 802,958 and being the primary commercial, financial, and industrial center of the region. It shall likewise continue its role in providing basic services, particularly to the incoming and outgoing visitors and investors in the region.

Further, it is also visualized that in 2050, Cotabato City will stimulate the growth of the region, thus developing into Metro Kutawato consisting the municipalities of Parang, Datu Odin Sinsuat, Sultan Kudarat, Sultan Mastura, and Upi. The creation of Metro Kutawato aims to improve the competitiveness of the region's mainland provinces taking into account the key contributions of other nearby municipalities in intensifying the economic development of the region.

As a metropolitan area, it shall be the center of development where government services, trade, finance, logistics, and social services are enhanced and harnessed to its full potential and paved the way for a more competitive region that is connected to other metropolitan cities in Mindanao.

## Overall BARMM Spatial Strategy, Functional Roles, and Growth Centers

The BARMM shall adopt a multi-nodal overall spatial strategy that consists of primary growth centers and secondary growth centers across the region. The six provinces, Cotabato City, and the SGA shall be the development nodes, and the growth centers are the areas from where the development emanates and radiates all over the region.

While there is an equitable support for the development of these areas in the multi-nodal approach, the level of development may vary among the different nodes. The eventual result in the long-term physical development of the eight nodes shall be the Corridor of New Economies (CONE) that is anchored on the functional roles.

Functional roles were determined by assessing the comparative advantages and potentials of the provinces. These functional roles, once developed, shall stimulate the growth the new economies and thereby help boost the region's economy.

### Cotabato City as the regional financial and commercial hub

Cotabato City is the Central Business District (CBD) of BARMM.

## Vulnerability Reduction

Vulnerability reduction is a principle of spatial strategy that includes the security and protection of agglomerated and connected infrastructure against threats from man-made and natural disasters. It considers the climate change projections and threats of hydrometeorological and geologic hazard, and other events including public health emergencies with increasing initiatives on disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation.

### Hydrometeorological Hazards

The BARMM has become more susceptible to climate change and disasters. This is reflected in their high exposure and vulnerability to floods and droughts. Natural disasters have become more frequent and damaging. Therefore, typhoons and droughts caused displacement, loss of livelihood, disruption of agricultural activities, and food insecurity.

Frequent flooding in low-lying areas, especially in Cotabato City, Maguindanao, and Lanao del Sur, is caused by persistent rainfall in the BARMM and Northern Mindanao that affects large numbers of communities in the region. In addition, BARMM is affected by storm surges particularly in Maguindanao, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi.

Recently, the diminishing area of forest cover, rain-induced landslides, and soil erosions are experienced in the provinces of Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Basilan, and Sulu.

### Geological Hazards

There are two trenches that engulf the region causing the occurrence of earthquakes and tsunamis. Epicenters are located around faults and trenches. Sulu Trench is on the west side of the island provinces of the region and the Cotabato Trench is located in the southwestern coast of the mainland area of the region.

### Volcanic Hazards

The region has two dormant stratovolcanoes, namely, Mt. Ragang and Mt. Makaturing. Both are located in the province of Lanao del Sur. The Mt. Ragang is the 7th highest volcano in the country and recorded its last eruption in 1916 while Mt. Makaturing erupted in 1882.

# Chapter 4: Bangsamoro Development Framework 2023-2028

This chapter consists of three sections. The first section presents the Bangsamoro Development Framework, covering the full hierarchy of results and the corresponding strategies. The second section covers the macroeconomic targets, justifications, and key assumptions. The third section discusses how the 2nd BDP satisfies a crucial planning standard - vertical and horizontal alignment.

## Bangsamoro Development Framework 2023-2028

### Vision

Consistent with the national direction, the Plan's sectoral framework is based on the national framework, but with a focus on regional strategies. It also emphasizes the regional vision: "A Bangsamoro that is united, enlightened, self-governing, peaceful, just, morally upright, and progressive."

The Bangsamoro government also envisions a territory devoid of all types of conflict - one that is permanently peaceful and where residents enjoy a sense of security and comfort as well as just, morally upright, and forward-thinking leadership.

Aside from the fact that a vision is typically long-term in character, key elements such as peace, unity, and justice continue to be relevant as a desired state by the end of 2028.

### Mission

In support to the realization of the vision, the Bangsamoro government is determined to accomplish this mission:

"Guided by moral governance and in pursuit of genuine and meaningful autonomy, the Bangsamoro government ensures the necessary conditions for enduring peace and sustained socioeconomic development suitable to the systems of life, needs, and aspirations of its people by providing services to communities, ensuring multi-stakeholder participation, and facilitating appropriate partnership."

Principles of moral governance and genuine and meaningful autonomy remain central for the Bangsamoro government in achieving the twin goals of lasting peace and sustainable socioeconomic development in the region. Further, the value of inclusion through multi-stakeholder participation and effective governance through services to communities remain to be salient features of the Bangsamoro leadership.

### Overall Goal

The framework of this plan is intended to help the Bangsamoro government in taking a systematic approach to help identify, quantify, and justify the strategies that will help attain the objectives of the region.

The overall goal is to have an empowered, cohesive, and progressive Bangsamoro. "Empowered" refers to the improved capacity of the communities as a byproduct of improved access to quality basic social services and widening of economic opportunities, which are caused by a remarkable growth in institution building and service delivery. "Cohesive" aims to have improved relationships between and among the stakeholders in the Bangsamoro as evidenced in reduced incidence of violent conflict and forged partnerships in governance or in broader development work, while "Progressive" aims to attain a sustained ability of the Bangsamoro region to optimize existing and potential resources in addressing the development needs of the communities and in realizing the economic and the human potential of the region.

### Development Goals

The 2nd BDP consists of six (6) development goals, as follows:

**Goal 1: Stable, just, and accountable government**

Development administration assumes a level of stability in the face of external and internal shocks, ensuring continuity of service delivery. It reflects the ability of ministries, government offices, and authorities to carry out their duties effectively and efficiently, even during emergencies and political events such as elections or any changes in power.

A just government means that the government is the primary agent of economic and social justice. It also means that the government will exercise all powers prudently to advance the public interest and the leaders use their powers to ensure inclusive and pervasive growth.

On the other hand, accountable government means that institutions, leaders, and staff are held accountable for the use of government resources and powers. It also means having accountability frameworks, mechanisms, systems, and processes in place to recognize and reward good performance, learn lessons, and avoid or stop bad practices.

**Goal 2: Equitable, competitive, and robust economy**

An equitable economy implies that economic gains are benefitted by all with special consideration for the poor and marginalized. It also implies that remarkable improvements in key inequality indicators such as Gini coefficient, poverty gap, and poverty severity have been observed.

Competitive economy implies that the BARMM economy enjoys comparative and competitive advantage in selected commodities, and these advantages have been optimized through improved local and international market linkages. It also implies the use of technology by key players in the development and promotion of local products. At the macroeconomic level, this implies a sustained double-digit growth in GDP, and that industry and services sectors account a significant share in the overall economy.

Robust economy implies that the Bangsamoro economy exemplifies a sustained growth over the next six years. It also means that the Bangsamoro government's goal and supporting policies strive to diversify and stabilize the economy to increase the number of quality job opportunities and improve access to goods and services.

**Goal 3: Peaceful, safe, and resilient Bangsamoro communities**

The Bangsamoro aims to achieve lasting peace through ensuring security and intensifying peace-building efforts. It also aims to have a safe community for the Bangsamoro by protecting the Bangsamoro people as well as creating communities that able to withstand natural calamities and human-induced disasters.

**Goal 4: Inclusive, responsive, and quality social services**

The Bangsamoro government aims to have quality social services that are inclusive of all sectors regardless of colors, tribes, and political affiliations to ensure that it will leave no one behind. The Bangsamoro government also ensures that services respond to the needs of the people of all kinds and the Bangsamoro as a whole.

**Goal 5: Rich and diverse Bangsamoro culture and identity preserved and recognized**

The Bangsamoro should exercise its powers and authority to maintain and promote its rich, diverse culture and identity. Its recognition and promotion are mandated under the Sec. 24, Art. IX of the BOL as it is the primary cause of the Bangsamoro struggle.

**Goal 6: Strategic, adequate, and climate-resilient infrastructure**

Strategic refers to the type of infrastructure that has broad-based and inclusive effects to the industries and communities. Adequate refers on the ability to meet infrastructure demands of the industries and communities, and climate-resilient refers to the type of infrastructure that can withstand calamities induced by climate change.

### Development Strategies

Development strategies are identified to ensure that development initiatives in the BARMM are geared towards the attainment of the higher-level development goals, thereby contributing to the national priorities.

1. Improve and strengthen governance mechanisms for a stable, just, and accountable Bangsamoro government;
2. Create an enabling environment towards an equitable, competitive, and robust economy;
3. Harness technology and innovations to increase socioeconomic opportunities and improve government services;
4. Improve ecological integrity, resilience of communities, and ensure a healthy and clean environment;
5. Enhance and strengthen the peace, public order, safety, and security and uphold human rights for inclusive, peaceful, progressive, and sustainable development;
6. Ensure inclusive and equitable access to quality services for social justice and human capital development;
7. Mainstream Bangsamoro cultural diversity, beliefs, heritage, and identity; and
8. Scale-up functional, strategic, climate-resilient, and quality infrastructure to support sustainable socioeconomic development in the Bangsamoro.

## Pillars of Moral Governance

Moral Governance is at the centerpiece of BARMM's leadership and governance for 2023-2028. This core value is exemplified in the principles of the following:

1. **Integrity.** In order to avoid being influenced in the execution of their official duties, those in positions of public trust should not bind themselves in any manner, whether financially or otherwise.

2. **Accountability.** Public office holders should be as open and transparent about all decisions and actions they take. They should document their decisions and limit information only when the larger public interest clearly requires it. Public servants must answer to the people and the authority.

3. **Transparency and honesty.** Holders of public offices must declare any private interests related to their public duties and take steps to resolve any conflicts that arise in a way that protects the public interest. All public transactions should be made public.

4. **Sense of patriotism.** Government officials should invest heavily in their way of life, achievements, rich history, and love for country. Also, the reputation and integrity of the place must be maintained and protected.

5. **Striving for excellence.** To achieve excellence, we must uphold the legitimacy of all our actions. The community will benefit whether public servants consider the credibility and transparency of their work. They should strive to deliver the highest quality in everything they do, prioritizing process over results for the good of all.

6. **Cultural understanding and tolerance.** Public officials should gain a better understanding and awareness on the socioeconomics and differences between societies. They should invest heavily in how they are important for these specific provincial elements, adding variety to the entire Bangsamoro.

7. **Unwavering loyalty to God.** Unwavering devotion to God is one characteristic of an effective public servant. As a result, public officials designated as leaders are required to strictly follow the rules and regulations set by authorities.

8. **Justice.** A public servant should serve the public without prejudice. Equity should triumph without regard for oneself, family and members, companions, or social and political alliances.

9. **Inclusivity.** A good public servant fosters an inclusive environment that makes communities more welcoming and freer from discrimination based on religion, ethnicity, or culture. They appreciate the region's identity-building and cultural characteristics.

10. **Objectivity.** Holders of public office should make only merit-based decisions when conducting public business, such as making public appointments, awarding contracts, or recommending individuals for rewards and benefits. Public officials should decide solely in the public interest. They should do nothing to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their families, and others.

11. **Dialogue and meaningful engagement.** Public servants should ask the opinion of the community by making dialogue with them to specify what needs to be addressed and to get meaningful engagement and positive change to benefit both parties.

12. **Balance between practical life and the moral side.** In carrying out government duties, public servants must balance the practical and the moral or ethical values. They must not deviate from the moral aspect of carrying out their duties and responsibilities, especially in the public's interest.

### Target 1: Sustain an annual average growth rate of 8.0 percent to 9.0 percent for six years

The primary target is to have a sustained growth rather than one-time growth and using an annual average growth rate allows an economy to recover from an internal or external shock. As the region with the lowest economic performance at 1.4 percent share of overall economic growth, it cannot achieve the same level of growth as the national average. The growth rate must be higher to be able to catch up with other regions.

One of the assumptions is that there will be no sustained large-scale war in the next six years. Significant headways in the peace process and a sharp decline in incidents of violent conflict will bolster investor confidence, leading to fresh investments in the BARMM. The region will recover from the ill-effects of the pandemic and there will be no large-scale external shock that will require long term lockdowns and economic restrictions. With most sectors and industries still in their infancy, government expenditure is expected to "pump-prime" the economy. In addition, there are no large-scale internal and external shocks that could potentially wipe out initial economic gains with the scale of a pandemic.

### Target 2: GRDP per capita will have an annual average growth rate of 6 percent to 9 percent within six-years

The economic growth rate will largely outpace the population growth rate. GRDP per capita is a good complement to GRDP as it reflects distribution.

There will be a sustained economic growth rate within the range of 8.0 percent to 9.0 percent and annual population growth will be between 2.0 percent to 4.0 percent for the next six years.

### Target 3: Services and industry sectors to register a sustained double-digit real growth, ranging from 10 percent to 12 percent

Growth in the services and industry sectors is instrumental to inclusive and broad-based growth, as these are the sectors that generate jobs, create wealth, and have greater resiliency at the time of natural calamities such as unfavorable weather conditions. AFF remains BARMM's strongest economic sector, but it needs to be complemented with growth in industry and services to create a more balanced, resilient, and equitable economy. A large portion of the new investments coming into the region as BARMM opens its economy will be in the industry and services sectors. Construction, mining and quarrying, wholesale and retail trade, real estate and ownership of dwellings, accommodation, and food service activities are among the sub-sectors that are expected to be bullish that will generate more jobs.

### Target 4: An upward trend in capital formation in the next six years is anticipated as BARMM registers greater stability and predictability in terms of investment climate. By the end of 2028, Gross Capital Formation should account for 18 percent to 20 percent of GRDE or GRDP.

It is capital formation that will cause long-term and sustainable growth in the region. However, it is highly sensitive to the political and social realities in the region. The passage of priority codes, particularly the Investment Code, will put in place a set of rules and procedures - creating a healthy, stable, and predictable investment climate.

Assumptions include priority codes and other important bills that will be enacted during the extension period; and political events (or changes in power) will not cause or lead to overall regional instability.

### Target 5: Inflation rate maintained at 2.0 percent to 4.0 percent

An inflation rate beyond 4.0 percent will already have repercussions on food items and basic necessities. This target can be achieved by improved competition in markets, a reliable supply chain, and improved connectivity between and across markets as a result of large-scale investments in infrastructure.

Among the assumptions are the national government's investments in large-scale public infrastructure in the region, such as airports, ports, national roads, bridges, and telecommunications that will facilitate trade, improve competition, and reduce operational costs; and BARMM and the LGUs will complement this by investing in local roads, public terminals, and other public infrastructures.

### Target 6: Unemployment rate at 3.0 percent to 5.0 percent; and underemployment rate at 4.0 percent to 7.0 percent

An increasing number of investments and the assistance of the development partners in the region that contributes to the economic performance and development will result to a lower unemployment rate.

Underemployment is a more critical feature in BARMM as a large portion of the population depends on AFF for food and income. With services and industry registering significant shares to overall economic performance, underemployment is likely to be reduced and maintained within 4.0 percent to 7.0 percent since underemployment is more of a rural phenomenon.

Services and industry sectors will have a steady growth in the next 3-6 years, reducing the vulnerability of a significant percentage of the labor force to underemployment issues.

### Target 7: Poverty incidence at 20 percent to 25 percent; poverty gap at downward trend, and poverty severity at downward trend

Given the significant reduction in poverty incidence in 2021, the Bangsamoro government can sustain a double-digit drop in poverty incidence of the region. The target is to reduce poverty incidence to a range of 20 percent to 25 percent with poverty gap and poverty severity on a downward trend.

The poverty gap and poverty severity are critical indicators for BARMM as these reflect distribution issues. The poverty gap is critical because it reflects the depth of poverty, while the poverty severity is equally critical because it reflects inequality between and among the poor. Conflict in BARMM is an injustice issue, and inequality between and among the poor is a strong manifestation of economic injustice.

Social protection programs will continue and will be further strengthened through better systems at the regional and local levels. These programs are vital and, in fact, serve as lifelines during emergencies.

## Ensuring Horizontal Alignment

When it comes to horizontal alignment, the Bangsamoro government also ensures that the 2nd BDP is aligned with the Enhanced 12-Point Priority Agenda of the BARMM.

The BDIP translates the 2nd BDP's development thrusts and priorities into concrete programs and projects. The AIP shall be prepared to serve as basis in the preparation of the budget proposals of BARMM MOAs for possible funding through the GAAB.

---

## Ensuring Vertical Alignment

The Bangsamoro government ensures that the strategies were vertically linked to the Mindanao development plans, the 8-Point Socioeconomic Agenda of the Marcos Administration, PDP 2023-2028, Ambisyon Natin 2040, and SDGs.

### Alignment to the Mindanao Development Agenda

The Bangsamoro government ensures that its development strategies were in line with the development agenda of Mindanao in order to create economic opportunities, integration, and growth throughout the entire Mindanao. Through this strategy, the BARMM will be part of future development initiatives in Mindanao as well as in the BIMP-EAGA.

### Alignment to the 8-Point Socioeconomic Agenda of the Marcos Administration

The 2nd BDP is bolstered, outlining its strategies to contribute to the Marcos administration's 8-point socioeconomic strategy to intensify efforts to mitigate the effects of inflation through its overarching objective of reviving job growth and reducing poverty by guiding the economy back to its high-growth course and, more significantly, via economic reform for a wealthy, inclusive, and resilient society.

The 8-Point Socioeconomic Agenda is strategically focused on several economic issues, including minimizing socioeconomic scarring, reducing transportation and logistics costs, enhancing social protections, ensuring sound macroeconomic fundamentals by improving bureaucratic efficiency, increasing employability to create more jobs, improving infrastructure, achieving energy security, and encouraging research, development, and innovation.

In a similar vein, the 2nd BDP's overarching goal is to create an empowered, cohesive, and progressive Bangsamoro. The plan has identified development strategies that will ensure that activities in the BARMM are directed toward achieving higher-level development goals and also supporting national priorities.

### Alignment to the PDP 2023-2028

In achieving the nation's development agenda, the Bangsamoro government collaborates with the national government. The 2nd BDP is a six-year plan that follows the national planning period.

The Bangsamoro government guaranteed that the 2nd BDP is in conformity with the PDP 2023-2028, which is focused on achieving economic transformation for prosperity, inclusivity, and resilience. It is also aligned and supporting the realization of the Ambisyon Natin 2040.

### Alignment to the SDGs

The SDGs provide a practical framework for pinpointing the region's potential contributions and developing a focused action plan for development strategy.

Linking regional development initiatives with the SDGs would significantly contribute in building a better world while addressing the development risks and concerns in the region. The Bangsamoro government could then direct its programs and projects on the pertinent problems, transforming challenges brought on by resource scarcity, population growth, poverty, and environmental issues into real opportunities.

### Table 4.2 Alignment of the 2nd BDP 2023-2028 to the Mindanao Development Agenda, 8-Point Socioeconomic Agenda of the Marcos Administration, PDP 2023-2028, and SDG

# Chapter 5: Improving and Strengthening Governance Mechanisms for Stable, Just, and Accountable Bangsamoro Government

The BOL provides the Bangsamoro government the autonomy to exercise self-governance, powers to promote the general welfare, authority to regulate its constituent LGUs, a mechanism for resolving intergovernmental relations, a justice system in consonance with traditional laws and the Constitution, and the benefit of enjoying fiscal autonomy, among others. Most critically, the BOL designates the BTA as the interim government during the transition.

This chapter describes the Bangsamoro government's overall strategy for handling its development administration or governance sector. It supports the BARMM's enhanced 12-Point Priority Agenda 1 which aims to strengthen the bureaucracy in the region and Agenda 3 which aims to increase revenue generation and economic comparative advantages. It is also consistent with the Marcos Administration's 8-point Socioeconomic Agenda 3 - Enhance Bureaucratic Efficiency and Sound Fiscal Management; aligned with the SDG 16 — Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions; and SDG 17 — Partnerships to Achieve the Goal.

This chapter covers the six sub-sectors of the development administration sector, namely: Bureaucracy, Development Planning, Legislation, Fiscal Management, Multi-Stakeholder Engagement, and the Bangsamoro Justice System.

## Sectoral Assessment

### Sectoral Trends

The development administration as a sector under the BEDC ensures to address developmental, governance and socio-economic changes, issues, and challenges. Symbiotic with public administration, the sector is presumed to be the central part of development. Together with all other sectors, the development administration sector oversees interconnecting policies and directions of the planning, programming, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation of all development programs, projects, and services and alignment to the development initiatives of the national and local governments.

The sector is steered by the DACom and composed of BARMM MOAs mandated with administration and oversight functions.

In the 1st BDP 2020-2022, the development administration sector plays an integral part in the establishment of the BARMM bureaucracy. The establishment of the foundations for an inclusive, transparent, accountable, and efficient governance is the first of the eight BDP development goals that the BARMM government identified as vital for the attainment of the overall goal of uplifting the lives of the Bangsamoro and establishing the foundations of self-governance through moral governance.

## Bureaucracy

**Organizational strengthening gaining momentum, though gaps persist.** The change of political structure provided by BOL creates opportunities for the Bangsamoro to exercise self-governance through a parliamentary form of government. The shift from unitary to parliamentary government system supports stronger executive-legislative working relationships. Further, the merging of agencies allows for systematic and integrated interventions. Thus, issues on previously non-devolved offices were strengthened, thereby addressing government response capacities.

In 2020, 15 ministries were created and fully operationalized upon the enactment of the BAA 13 or the Bangsamoro Administrative Code. Previously, the defunct ARMM had 25 regional departments, and these were restructured during the transition of ARMM to BARMM.

The approved BAA 13 and the 1st BDP 2020-2022 stated that 33 offices would be created in the BARMM. Only 48 percent of the proposed 16 offices in the year 2020 and 55 percent of the proposed 33 offices in the years 2021 and 2022 are fully operationalized.

Since the ratification of the BOL in 2019, the Bangsamoro government utilized the budget of the defunct ARMM and the allocation for the Modified Disbursement System (MDS) and locally funded agencies is applied and operated.

All the fundamentals of institutionalizing the structure of the created offices are still in process. Further, the disparity on the scale describes that the offices created and established during the ARMM period significantly differ from BARMM, which is outlined in a parliamentary form of government.

As part of establishing the bureaucracy, the Bangsamoro government, through the MFBM, has created and authorized 50,467 positions across 15 ministries and 13 executive offices as of November 18, 2022. This includes the absorbed positions of employees from the education, health, and social services sectors. Of this number, 72.55 percent or 35,812 positions are already filled-in as of November 2022.

Meanwhile, 1,078 coterminous positions are also created mostly under the Parliament with 92.67 percent hiring rate. There are also 336 contractual plantilla positions created, but only 17.55 percent are filled-in.

**Mechanism for coordinating regional development efforts fully functional.** The BEDC as the socio-economic planning, monitoring, and coordinating agency for all development policies, plans, programs, and projects of the Bangsamoro government shall evaluate and recommend short-, medium-, and long-term comprehensive development plans, programs, and projects for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region for approval by the Parliament. The development plans, programs, and projects shall take into account the development plans of the provinces, cities, municipalities, and barangays as approved by their respective local development councils.

In 2019, the BEDC was established and tasked to focus on the socio-economic development in the BARMM together with its five committees that will assist the Council in performing its mandate and responsibilities namely: DACom, PPOSSCom, EDCom, SDCom, IDCom. It also has special committees namely: RSCom, RLUC, and RPMECom. In 2021, the Bangsamoro Gender and Development Special Committee (BGADSC) was established as a special committee on GAD.

Article VI of the BOL emphasizes the importance of intergovernmental relations (IGR) between the national government and the Bangsamoro government, specifically for the integration, coordination, and harmonization of policies, and programs.

Even though the priorities of both governments are to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic during its height, six out of eight or 71 percent of the IGR mechanisms in the BOL have already been operationalized. The other two mechanisms are the Philippines Congress - Bangsamoro Parliament Forum (PCBPF) and the Bangsamoro Sustainable Development Board (BSDB).

On November 15, 2022, the first Philippine Congress-Bangsamoro Parliament Forum (PCBPF) was convened marking another milestone in the implementation of BOL. While the BSDB was already passed into law last June 2022.

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the IGRB and other IGR mechanisms continued to fulfill their mandate of resolving IGR issues between the national government and the Bangsamoro government.

**Turnover of Cotabato City to the BARMM: A major IGRB milestone.** The most significant milestone of the IGRB was the turnover of Cotabato City to the BARMM which was eventually took effect through a ceremony on December 15, 2020 at the Shariff Kabunsuan Cultural Complex (SKCC) in the Bangsamoro Government Center (BGC), Cotabato City. This was pursuant to the directive of former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte to complete the turnover in December 2020, a year after the issue was first raised by the Bangsamoro government to the IGRB during its first consultative meeting on December 16, 2019.

The DILG and the MILG spearheaded the turnover, with consultations from the city government of Cotabato and the Bangsamoro government. During the ceremony, national government secretary of the Interior and Local Government Eduardo M. Año signed the documents for the transfer of supervision of Cotabato City to the MILG, as well as the properties, assets, and records of the DILG Cotabato City field office.

Other milestones of the IGRB include salaries of teacher and education sector employees in the SGA and in Cotabato City; Omnibus Request of the Bangsamoro government to the Civil Service Commission (CSC); creation of regional offices of the National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM), Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP), and Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) in the BARMM; establishment of Bangsamoro Electoral Office (BEO); participation of the Bangsamoro government in the national development planning; and transfer of existing natural reserves and protected areas to the Bangsamoro government.

In 2021, 59 percent of the 70 LGUs in BARMM were compliant with the seven elements of LGUs functionality, compared to 50 percent in 2020. However, in 2019, data were not provided due to the transition process.

The island provinces registered a relatively low compliance with LGU functionality due to its geographic disadvantages. The mobility, connectivity, insufficiency of facilities, and the scarcity of construction-imposed materials are among the challenges in terms of the service delivery in the area.

The BARMM has high hopes that it will increase its number of functional LGUs, particularly those in the island provinces. The recent opening of routes such as the Cotabato to Tawi-Tawi flight routes and taking advantage of the Tawi-Tawi as the front door to the BIMP-EAGA will significantly change the status of concerned LGUs in BARMM.

**Transforming governance through Bangsamoro local government incentives and awards.** The BARMM through the MILG evaluates the functionality of LGUs through the following seven elements: presence of a government center with facilities; presence of working elected and appointed mandatory officials and functionaries; functional local special bodies; functional local legislative body; approved mandated plans and budget; availability of basic services; and sound fiscal management.

The Seal of Good Local Governance (SGLG) puts a high premium on integrity and good performance as pillars of meaningful local autonomy and development. Of the total LGUs, 28 were awarded in 2019 compared to the 23 in 2018. The province of Maguindanao got the most awardees, followed by Lanao del Sur. Limited mobility due to COVID-19 pandemic, MILG suspended the awarding of SGLG in 2020 and 2021. In 2022, a total of 14 LGUs were awarded with SGLG including one from Basilan, ten from Maguindanao, two from Lanao del Sur, and Lamitan City.

Despite the few percentages of awardees, the slight increase from 2018 to 2019 was a good indication for the Bangsamoro government's effort in pushing its constituent LGUs to perform. However, progress was impeded due to challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, which triggered the DILG national to suspend the SGLG assessment process in all regions.

Guided by principles and advancing moral governance in the Bangsamoro, the Salamat Excellence Award for Leadership (SEAL) was launched in 2020 inspired by the documentation of life story and leadership principle and practices of Amerul Mujaheedin, and development of excellence award for Local Chief Executives (LCEs) who have demonstrated similar passion for the welfare of Bangsamoro people.

A total of six LCEs in 2020 across the BARMM were awarded for showing exemplary leadership practices in emulating accountable, participatory, and service-oriented leadership which have verifiable impact to the achievement of the four core strategies in running public organizations. The Bangsamoro government continues its efforts in delivering and inspiring more LCEs to gain such awards. To date, a total of seven LCEs have gained the prestigious SEAL award with five finalists in the year 2021.

Since July 25, 2022 to August 26, 2022, the application and nomination for the SEAL has officially opened to all LCEs that are qualified and have met the requirements based on MILG MC No. 125, series of 2022 re: Guidelines in the Implementation of SEAL Program CY 2022.

Barangay Kauran in Ampatuan, Maguindanao, was the first awardee in the BARMM that received the first runner-up for the 4-6th class municipalities category of the Lupong Tagapamayapa Incentives Award (LTIA) for CY 2022 during the national awards ceremony held on November 28, 2022 at The Manila Hotel, Ermita, Manila.

LTIA is a system of providing economic benefits and other incentives to outstanding Lupong Tagapamayapa, the body that comprises the Katarungang Pambarangay or Barangay Justice System, established to settle minor cases involving barangay residents outside of the courts that demonstrate exemplary performance in resolving disputes at the grassroots or barangay level.

On anti-drug campaign efforts for the year 2022, a total of six LGUs hailed as national awardees for the Anti-Drug Abuse Council (ADAC) Performance Audit. The award is in recognition of the exemplary performance in the implementation of all anti-illegal drug programs, projects, and activities of the LGUs.

The search continues with the implementation of the 3rd annual LGU Grant Assistance for Innovative Practices (LGAIP) that aims to highlight LGU innovative practices at the regional level, making it a benchmark for strategies that LGUs may utilize in delivering quality services through innovative means despite the challenges being faced by the local governance. The MILG conducted the final screening process for the shortlisted 10 applicants of the program and was able to identify innovative practices worthy of the award and secure agreement between the winning parties and the ministry. To date, a total of 14 LGUs have been awarded with LGAIP award.

The Search for Model Barangays (SMB) is the newest incentive program of the MILG that aims to recognize barangays with exemplary performance and to serve as fine examples and inspirations on good governance among the 2,590 barangays in the region.

Barangay Rempes in Upi, Maguindanao was declared the first Model Barangay Awardee for CY 2021 and received Php1 million and building marker as incentives. A total of 11 barangays were awarded as Model Barangay for CY 2022.

The shortlisted barangays are also passers of the SGLG for Barangay (SGLGB) and LTIA, garnered IDEAL rating for the Local Government Functionality Appraisal for Barangay (LoGFA-B), and have the HIGH or IDEAL rating of Functionality Audit for the Barangay Based-Institutions as pre-requisite to be eligible to this award.

The LoGFA and Performance Assessment Scorecard System (PASS) are the performance oversight assessment tools that intend to assess the functionality of LGUs in BARMM. These tools aim to assess the LGUs, particularly on the abovementioned seven elements of functionality as implementing tool for the LoGFA. A total of 57 LGUs in 2020, 66 in 2021, and 59 in 2022 with Ideal Functionality were awarded under the LoGFA.

**More LGUs compliant to Seal of Good Financial Housekeeping (SGFH).** In 2019, a total of 89 LGUs in the BARMM were awarded with SGFH, accounting for 75 percent of the total number of LGUs.

Maguindanao provincial office passed the SGFH standards with only a few barangays not fully compliant. Remarkably, in 2021, despite the challenges due to the breakout of COVID-19 in the previous year, which impeded the progress of the program. The province is now completely recognized with a hundred percent SGFH compliant. Followed by the province of Lanao del Sur with 29 LGUs or 74 percent, in 2019 and 22 LGUs or 56 percent, in 2021. Similarly, the majority of the functional LGUs across the Bangsamoro region were awarded with SGFH, which implies a respectable change compared with preceding years.

**More LGUs are compliant to the Full Disclosure Policy (FDP).** The MILG sustained the drive for greater LGU transparency and accountability with 98 LGUs in 2019, 103 in 2020, and 102 in 2021 compliant with FDP.

Pursuant to the mandate of the MILG to assist the Chief Minister in exercising general supervision over the constituent LGUs of BARMM, one of the fundamentals of the regulatory dimensions of such supervision is compliance to government policies. Progress in compliance among LGUs to national and regional policies was demonstrated.

The compliance of LGUs to national and regional policies is regularly monitored using the Performance Audit and Compliance Tracking System (PACTS). From 2020-2021, the number of PACTS passers in the BARMM slightly improved from 33 LGUs to 43 functional LGUs. Among the LGUs, Cotabato City has been consistent and strictly complying with the policy despite the pandemic in 2020.

Under PACTS, the acquiescence of the 10-Policy Areas is regularly monitored in the level of the LGUs, namely: 1) Full Disclosure of Local Budget and Finances, and Bids and Public Offerings, 2) Attendance of Local Chief Executives, 3) Sanggunian Functionality, 4) Attendance of Local Authorities, 5) Implementation of the five percent disaster risk reduction and management fund (DRRMF), 6) Local Special Bodies, 7) Physical Implementation and Utilization of 20 percent Development Fund, 8) Submission of Annual Accomplishment Report, 9) Ecological Solid Waste Management (ESWM), and 10) Provincial Development and Physical Framework Plan (PPDFP)/ Comprehensive Development Plan (CDP).

**Inconsistent trend in terms of compliance to mandated plans.** In terms of PDPFP, the data shows that there is a fluctuating trend of performance in 2021 with only two compliant LGUs or 40 percent in comparison to the 2020 figures where only four provincial offices or 80 percent out of five have complied.

Province of Maguindanao had the highest number of LGUs that submitted comprehensive land use plan (CLUP) from 2020 to 2021. On the other hand, the preparation of CLUP must be prioritized by every LGU, as only 45 LGUs accomplished this in 2021, compared to 50 in 2020.

**Presence of Government Centers with Facilities.** In order for local government centers to be classified as functional, data on presence of government centers with facilities serve as the basis. Increase and decrease in the numbers through the years can be attributed to Bangsamoro Government interventions through Support to Local Moral Governance (SLMG) program, and a more stringent inventory of facilities.

---

## Development Planning

**Regular plans formulated and adopted in the BARMM for the year 2019 to 2022.** The BPDA, as a technical arm of the Bangsamoro government, had formulated three regular plans for the past three years and were adopted by the BEDC. In 2020, the 1st BDP, 2022-2025 was formulated and adopted, while, the Bangsamoro Response and Recovery Plan (BRRP) and the Camp Transformation Plan (CTP) were adopted in the year 2021. The mentioned preceding plans were crafted and aligned to the BARMM 12-point priority agenda in realization of the Bangsamoro government's overall goal of uplifting the lives of the Bangsamoro people through moral governance.

As a key component for achieving moral governance, the Bangsamoro government ensures formulating relevant and responsive plans. The 1st BDP was primarily set to achieve its overall goal of uplifting the lives of the Bangsamoro people through moral governance, and the development planning keeps its tract gearing towards the Philippine long-term vision — Ambisyon Natin 2040. The BRRP was also formulated in response to the COVID-19 outbreak in the region, while the CTP is strongly anchored to the normalization process under the CAB to fulfill the moral obligation of the Bangsamoro.

---

## Legislation

The BTA is mandated to exercise the powers granted to it under Section 5, Article VII of the BOL. One of the functions of the parliament is to enact laws to promote, protect, and ensure the general welfare of the Bangsamoro people and other inhabitants in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

As of 2021, three of the seven priority codes were already enacted. In 2020, out of seven priority codes only the Bangsamoro Administrative Code was signed into law by the Parliament on October 28, 2020. In 2021, two additional codes were signed into law, namely, the Bangsamoro Civil Service Code, which was approved by the Parliament on February 24, 2021, and the Bangsamoro Education Code which was enacted on May 18, 2021. To date, the Members of the Parliament are working on the four remaining priority codes.

A total of 260 out of 748 resolutions or 34.75 percent were approved from 2019 to 2022. A total of 31 out of 184 or 16.84 percent of bills filed were approved by the Parliament from 2019 to 2022.

---

## Fiscal Management

The grant of fiscal autonomy as provided in Section 1, Article XII of RA 11054 paved for an exercise of self-governance not only in policy-setting but also in resource mobilization and expenditure management. Through fiscal autonomy, the Bangsamoro government is given the power to create sources of revenues besides the annual block grant provided by the national government, as well as exercise budget autonomy to ensure that these resources are spent in programmatic, transparent, performance-based, and phased manner.

The annual block grant is consistently the largest source of revenues from 2020 to 2022, accounting almost 90 percent of the total resources. This was followed by the Special Development Fund (SDF) which accounts for about seven percent of total revenues. Local collections registered the lowest contribution, accounting for less than one percent of total revenues.

Among the main causes that explain the erratic movement in the revenue collections of BARMM is the absence of enabling legislation, i.e., the Revenue Code. Its establishment will have a high impact on those agencies with collecting authority by further improving the management and mechanisms of imposition of the required tax, fees, and charges within the power conferred by the BOL. Thus, its effect is direct to local revenue collections which will improve tax revenues (i.e., regional wealth tax, contractors' tax, travel tax), regional fees and charges, and other revenues.

Furthermore, external factors also affect the increase/decrease of the revenue sources of BARMM as these are already provided in RA 11054.

First, the amount of the block grant shall be equivalent to five percent of the net national internal revenue tax collection of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and the net collection of the Bureau of Customs (BOC) from the third fiscal year immediately preceding the current fiscal year. Necessarily, the amount of annual block grants is directly dependent on the collections made by the national government. For instance, as an effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, which resulted in the dramatic decrease of the Philippine economy, hints at a lower revenue collection by the national government.

Second, the national government shall provide SDF to the Bangsamoro government for the rebuilding, rehabilitation, and development of its conflict-affected communities. The amount equivalent to Fifty Billion pesos (Php50,000,000,000.00), at five billion pesos (Php5,000,000,000.00) per year, for a period of 10 years from the ratification of the BOL, shall be allocated for this purpose.

Lastly, the share of the Bangsamoro government in the taxes collected by the national government is 75 percent inclusive of the shares of the constituent LGUs.

### Actual Expenditures

As a new government conferred with fiscal autonomy, the Bangsamoro government is placed in a strategic position which enables it to manage expenditures based on development interventions that truly responds to the peculiar needs of the region. What comes with this opportunity is the immense responsibility of the regional government to ensure that the spending of resources is not only aligned with the development direction of the region but also the management of expenditure is compliant with the generally accepted principles in budgeting as set by the national government.

For the past three fiscal years, the total revenue is utilized for the following: a) Regular Funds—funds appropriated for the regular operations of the ministries and offices; b) Special Development Funds—funds appropriated for special development projects based on the provision of the BOL; and c) Special Purpose Funds—funds which are appropriated for special programs or expenditures which may be performed or implemented by a ministry or office but are not lodged in their regular funds.

Of the total annual budget, the regular fund allocation can be seen to be on an increasing trend based on the 2020 data. This increase can be attributed to the improvement in the identification of regular functions of the implementing institutions due to the enactment of the BAA 13. On the other hand, the decrease in the Special Purpose Fund (SPF) is due to the minimal expenditures not considered to be part of the regular funds of the ministries and offices; this includes the Miscellaneous Personnel Benefit Fund (MPBF), the contingent fund, and the shares of the LGUs in the taxes, fees, and other charges collected by the national government within BARMM.

The appropriation based on the block grant and other sources commenced in year 2020 as the BTA Parliament enacted its first BAA 03 amounting to sixty-five billion nine hundred sixteen million four hundred sixty-seven thousand, six hundred eighty-six pesos and forty-six centavos (Php65,916,467,686.46) of which there is a 75 percent fund support rate as evidenced by allotment releases to the different ministries and offices.

Moreover, the second General Appropriations Act of the Bangsamoro (GAAB) enacted in 2021 appropriated an amount of seventy-five billion six hundred twenty-eight million six hundred eighty-one thousand seven hundred forty-eight pesos and twenty-six centavos (Php75,628,681,748.26), 84 percent of which were released to ministries and offices for their development interventions. Meanwhile, 52.57 percent or forty-two billion one hundred twenty-nine million two hundred forty-seven thousand three hundred thirty-six pesos and thirty-three centavos (Php42,129,247,336.33) of the appropriated funds were already released to the different ministries and offices as of October 31, 2022.

### Fund Utilization

For FY 2020, the Bangsamoro government incurred a 79.23 percent utilization rate for its BARMM MOA Regular Fund amounting to Php34,212,492,621.85 (Table 5.1). Out of this fund, 67.40 percent or Php13,567,088,578.93 was utilized for Personnel Services (PS), 95.62 percent or Php12,448,656,243.90 for Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE), and 81.69 percent or Php8,196,747,799.02 for the Capital Outlay (CO).

While the region is in its early inception, it is the priority of the Bangsamoro government to track its accomplishments and monitor its spending to ensure that the government interventions are provided in an effective, efficient, and responsive manner. Hence, the BARMM, through the joint effort of the OCM, MFBM, and the BPDA conducted a periodic assessment of the physical and financial performance of the BARMM MOAs.

### Revenue Collection

In 2019, the policy direction which the MFBM-BTO worked on was consistent with the moral governance program of the Chief Minister Ahod B. Ebrahim. Several trainings were conducted or participated by the employees of the MFBM-BTO on matters relating to treasury mechanisms, good practices, and application of moral governance to treasury practices for the purpose of increasing accountability on safe-keeping of BARMM funds. For the last quarter of FY 2019, operations have been stable and local funding requirements of BTA, and BARMM MOAs by virtue of the FY 2019 regional appropriations has been fully served.

The regional collections for FY 2019 amounted to Php394,709,755.62. The target for the period was Php248,615,000.00. Actual regional collection surpassed the target by Php146,094,755.62 or over 59 percent. Moreover, collection increased by 62.05 percent compared to the FY 2018 collection of Php243,568,364.68.

It was crucial for the MFBM-BTO to be prepared to receive the annual block grant starting CY 2020. The office ensured that the Authorized Depository Bank of the Bangsamoro has been opened in early January. The ARMM employees who were extended served as the accountable officers so there have been continuous treasury operations. The MFBM-BTO maintained a single account for all the funds received including local revenue collections. The MFBM-BTO was able to manage and safeguard revenues from the annual block grant, share from the national taxes, regional taxes, fees and charges, special development fund, and other subsidies from national government.

### Local Revenue Collection Performance

In 2019, local revenue collection surpassed the target by 59 percent. This collection is the highest collection reached by the Bangsamoro government. In 2020, even during the pandemic, the local revenue collection surpassed the target by 34 percent. Although the collection was greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the implementation of infrastructure projects and continuing increase in the collection of fees and charges particularly from the Bangsamoro regulatory offices have ensured the achievement of the target. Moreover, the remittance of the proceeds from the PAGIBIG financing of the housing project also contributed to the collection performance.

## Multi-stakeholder Engagement

Pursuant to Section 5 of BAA 06, the Council shall include all provincial governors of Tawi-Tawi, Basilan, Sulu, Maguindanao, and Lanao del Sur and all city mayors of Cotabato, Marawi, and Lamitan of the BARMM.

The participation of LGUs will ensure that the approved development plans of the provinces, cities, municipalities, and barangays are incorporated into the BDP. It also ensures its effectiveness and responsiveness to the needs of the Bangsamoro.

The Bangsamoro Parliament enacted BAA 06, establishing the BEDC, in accordance with the provisions of RA 11054. The act calls for the BEDC to include five Private Sector Representatives (PSRs) as regular members.

Section 5 of the BAA 06 states that the BEDC will select the five PSRs based on the drafted guidelines and qualification criteria developed by the BPDA and approved by the Council to ensure objectivity, integrity, and transparency. It also contains the accreditation and selection procedures, criteria, and the required qualifications of the nominating private sector organizations (PSOs) and PSR nominees. The purpose of the accreditation is to provide eligibility for the PSOs to nominate one of its members as a PSR member of the Council.

Concerning the socioeconomic development of BARMM, the BEDC has accredited CSOs working in BARMM in pursuit of public interests. In 2020, there have been 15 CSOs accredited by the Council, another 13 in 2021, and four in 2022. The first set of PSRs was nominated and accredited on December 29, 2020.

## Bangsamoro Justice System

The BARMM has its own regional judicial system that applies Shari'ah to its constituents. The BOL contains a provision to create a Shari'ah High Court. This Court will consist of five justices including a presiding justice and task to oversee the appellate courts, district courts, and circuit courts.

Aside from the Shari'ah High Court, the Shari'ah Public Assistance Office, and Bangsamoro Integrated Bar shall also be established.

To date, the Shari'ah High Court, Shari'ah Public Assistance Office, and Bangsamoro Integrated Bar are not yet established due to inadequate infrastructure facilities and the need to meet the required competencies and qualifications of Shari'ah Judges and personnel. The requirement for the office structure and personnel component of the Shari'ah High Court is crucial for the establishment of the BJS. The office structure and staffing will be patterned from the Court of Appeals (CA) justices.

In support to this, the Parliament proposed a resolution requesting the Supreme Court of the Philippines to facilitate the immediate organization of the Shari'ah High Court in the BARMM to uphold the spirit of the Shari'ah Justice System in the region.

As of 2019, the Judicial and Bar Council (JBC) has created 48 Shari'ah Circuit Courts (SCC) under the jurisdiction of the Shari'ah District Courts (SDC) in the BARMM. While only 33 of the SCC are organized and 15 are not yet organized located in Tawi-Tawi and Basilan.

It is stated in RA 11054 under section 17 that, "the Parliament shall enact laws to promote and support the traditional or tribal justice systems that are appropriate for the indigenous peoples. The traditional justice systems are the mechanisms to determine, settle, and decide controversies and enforce decisions involving disputes between members of the indigenous peoples concerned in accordance with the customary laws of these communities."

While, Section 20 under the same law provides that the Bangsamoro government shall adopt the principles of conciliation and mediation in settling disputes, with the Parliament enacting the necessary legislation to institute the mechanism for alternative dispute resolution. The Shari'ah courts and traditional or tribal adjudicatory tribunals may utilize this mode of settlement and resolution of cases.

## Development Opportunities

The following are the opportunities significant to the development administration:

**Innovation and technology as tools to facilitate good governance.** The COVID-19 pandemic has made it more difficult for people to physically gather, move around, and go about their everyday lives. Work from home, social distancing policies, and even partial or total lockdowns have been established by numerous governmental and commercial organizations or corporations.

In the area of information and communication technology, rapid advancements are already being made, and they are now widely employed to improve ease and effectiveness in many facets of daily life, including the government. Through innovation and technology, the government was able to sustain its operations by redefining its strategies and making them more creative by conducting meetings and transactions online.

This only proves that the role of technology in governance and the delivery of public services is becoming more crucial. Innovation makes progress inevitable, and technology acts as the driving force behind a government that is capable of operating on a global scale.

Hence, it is worth investing for the Bangsamoro government to take advantage of technological innovations as this help raise performance and productivity. More importantly, it makes a significant contribution to increasing accountability, transparency, information, public participation, and support for best governance practices.

On digital transparency of governance processes and bureaucracy, the launch of digital governance system strengthened through establishment of physical ICT infrastructure and systems will allow for direct and real time e-governance access of LGUs through programs such as DevLIVE+ and Localizing e-Governance for Accelerated Provision of Services (LEAPS) program. Piloted in the areas of Butig and Piagapo in Lanao del Sur with technical support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Bangsamoro team benchmarked the Access to Information (A2i) program of the Government of Bangladesh. The e-governance platform program is aimed at integrating government systems into digital service providers maximizing strong partnership with development partners and institutions.

The LEAPS project will help overcome the dependencies on archaic, paper-based, and manual processes within and among the BARMM LGUs. This project will also maximize the use of MILG's limited manpower and resources to deliver and monitor frontline services effectively and efficiently.

The DevLIVE+ generates socio-demographic profiles, not only at the municipal or barangay level but up to the household level. It also provides disaggregated data by sex, age, work, educational attainment, or spatial location through charts, lists, or even map locations that would facilitate analysis in crafting the local land use and development plans. Considering that significant socioeconomic indicators can be captured related to access to basic services among others, local decision-makers have found the tool essential in resource allocation, prioritization of barangays and delivery of services, or justify their programs, projects, and activities using the DevLIVE+ to improve the conditions of communities who are either most vulnerable, left behind, or lacking in access to government services.

To date, three Digital Service Design Lab (DSDL) workshops have already been conducted; 24 e-Services are simplified for digitalization; 24 Technical Assessment has been conducted for digital center and interactive call center; eight LGUs are already on-board for the DevLIVE+ implementation; two connectivities have already been installed; and one GPS/ICT Equipment have already been procured.

**Strong support and linkages with development partners, national agencies, and other stakeholders.** The Bangsamoro government is already receiving extensive help from development partners, national agencies, and other stakeholders. This support goes beyond local economic growth and development. They also help to address problems and difficulties the administration is facing as BARMM embarks through the extended transition.

An intensified partnership with donors and partners helps the Bangsamoro government achieve its development goal effectively and efficiently.

**3-year extension of the transition.** The BTA will continue to act as the interim administration for the BARMM under the terms of RA 11593, which also extends the transition period from May 2023 to May 2025.

This is an opportunity to review, evaluate, and update the BARMM government's current commitments as reflected in the administration's 12-point priority agenda and the region's 1st BDP in order to make sure that the strategic directions remain pertinent and responsive to the region's long-standing and new development challenges.

**Implementation of Mandanas-Garcia Ruling.** The Mandanas-Garcia Ruling ultimately broadened the national government revenue based on the computation of the annual intergovernmental fiscal transfers of LGUs; before it was estimated only on BIR collections but now it also includes the BOC collections.

## Priority Challenges to be Addressed within 2023-2028

### Bureaucracy

The following are the key challenges of bureaucracy to be addressed in 2023-2028:

**Overlapping and unclear functions in the delivery of services between and among different levels of the government.** Bangsamoro government in its transitional period faces different challenges in addressing the needs of its constituents. The ambiguous delineation of functions among national, regional, and local governments has been realized as one of the root causes of this problem. There are other ministries and offices that have the same beneficiaries for a certain program which resulted in duplication of deliverables due to the unclear distinction of their mandates. There is also an absence of a devolution policy from the national government to BARMM and BARMM to LGUs, and a slow phasing of IGRB concerns due to the multiplicity of priorities of the regional government that affect the full functionalities of other offices both in regional and local level.

**Weak inter-BARMM MOAs/LGUs coordination and linkages.** Lack of policies to enforce a strong link between BARMM MOAs and LGUs to strengthen collaboration in identifying problems and challenges on the ground and harmonizing programs to address the gaps.

Poor coordination among offices leads to poor appreciation of convergence and cooperation among offices' programs, projects, and activities that results in duplicity and unbalanced distribution of focus and prioritization.

**Mechanisms for administration and supervision of local governments not fully streamlined at the local level.** Inadequacy of regional policies in the implementation of transparency and accountability agenda and lack of awareness on existing national government policies are hindering factors to fully localized the programs.

**Intergovernmental relations mechanisms not fully established.** With the passage and ratification of the BOL and the establishment of the BARMM, the national and Bangsamoro governments realized the urgency to create an avenue that will further strengthen the relationship between both governments. Hence, On October 14, 2019, then President Rodrigo Roa Duterte approved the recommendation of the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process (OPAPP) to establish the IGRB through a memorandum issued by the Office of the Executive Secretary.

The IGRB is mandated to coordinate and resolve issues on IGR through regular consultation and continuing negotiations in a non-adversarial manner. It shall exhaust all means to resolve issues brought before it. Unresolved issues shall be elevated to the president, through the Chief Minister of the Bangsamoro government.

As of 2022, only five out of seven IGR mechanisms in the BOL have been operationalized including the Council of Leaders which began convening since January 18, 2021. The PCBPF is yet to be constituted on the side of the Philippine Congress and is to be operationalized while the bill creating the BSDB is pending in the Bangsamoro Parliament.

The national government remains steadfast in its commitment to support the BTA in fulfilling its mandate and functions within the extended transition period to 2025. The testament to this is the various intergovernmental relations bodies, most of which have already been organized. To this end, the creation of the remaining IGR mechanisms needs to be fast-tracked in order to institutionalize all avenues for greater intergovernmental cooperation.

**Nepotism and lack of political will.** One of the contributing factors of poor performance among officials and employees is the practice of nepotism or lack of political will. Those who have strong connections with the influenced individuals are accommodated to the positions regardless of their educational backgrounds, expertise, and experiences. Lack of commitment in the performance of one's duty greatly affects the service delivery to the public. Political dynamics in the process of recruitment is a hindrance in the provision of quality services.

### Development Planning

The following are the key challenges of development planning to be addressed in 2023-2028:

**Weak operationalization of planning and budgeting policies.** The absence of a harmonized regional plan and budget resulted in poor implementation of the PPAs. This poor harmonization can be attributed to limited technical know-how and expertise on planning and budgeting.

**Weak data and communications management.** The manual process and unsystematized data collection and management affects the formulation of development plan. The underlying factors aggravating the weak data and communication management include inadequate regional statistical system, insufficient evidence-based data, absence of development communication plan among BARMM MOAs, weak process of data reconciliation between the national, regional, and local levels, and absence of standardized IEC materials.

Outdated records management systems, inconvenient documents repository otherwise known as records center and regional library are also a challenge given that managing official records is a crucial part in the office operations that involves administrative, financial, and legal. Official public documents such as temporary and permanent in nature are necessary to be properly protected and preserved, as documentary evidence in any official transaction. Record is also a contributory factor to help settle the dispute and a basis of decision-making.

**Poor or non-implementation of some priority PPAs in the development plans.** Political interference and non-provision of standardized transition and strategic plan when leadership change hinders the implementation of the existing development plan to support the continuity of the identified program for implementation.

**Non-institutionalization of Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system.** The unavailability of standardized M&E system in the region prevents the generation of credible information through data collection by actual field monitoring. It is noteworthy that the monitoring activity can check the overall status and condition of the PPAs based on investment program while evaluation determines and measures the progress of its implementation and analyzes the effectivity and efficiency of the program. On the other hand, M&E also help find the emerging gaps and issues that impede its implementation.

It has been observed that slow development of the centralized database management system is driven by delayed provision of policy guidelines on the BARMM standardized M&E system. To expedite the process, while the BARMM M&E system is in the development phase, the adoption of the existing National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Regional Project Monitoring and Evaluation System (RPMES) is recommended to serve as guiding tool in the operationalization of the M&E in the BARMM.

In the development of guidelines on BARMM M&E system's operations manual, a strong support by the BEDC to its adoption and approval is imperative for the full-blown operation of the latter. Dedication and collaborative efforts of the BARMM MOAs and the capacity building that includes orientation, trainings, and benchmarking activities are essential as main catalysts that will greatly contribute to the creation of a functional technical working group in the desk and actual M&E activity.

Nonetheless, there is a need to invite M&E experts, specialists, or consultants from the national government to help develop the human resource capacity of both administrative and technical concerns of the M&E system, given the increasing and multiple development projects being implemented in the BARMM.

### Legislation

The following are the key challenges in terms of legislation to be addressed in 2023-2028:

**Slow enactment of some priority codes and other legislative measures.** The BARMM is currently adopting a parliamentary form of government which necessitates setting up a new bureaucracy under a parliamentary structure. The establishment of a strong organizational structure and necessary systems and processes will ensure the delivery of responsive, effective, and efficient services.

The COVID-19 pandemic has hampered the operations of the Bangsamoro Parliament. At the height of the pandemic, the Bangsamoro Parliament passed a resolution to ensure continuity in the conduct of plenary sessions, consultations, and meetings via teleconferencing. However, activities related to the enactment of priority codes and other legislative measures were still affected.

**Inadequate BTA human and physical resources.** Human and physical resources are vital in the success of one's organization as it serve as the driving factor in fulfilling its mandates. However, the Bangsamoro Parliament has inadequate human and physical resources due to weak implementation of hiring plan and merit-based selection process, political interventions, self-interest of political leaders, and inadequate infrastructure and technological support.

**Inadequate research and development in policy-making.** In policy-making, research and development (R&D) must always be considered due to its significance. The timely enactment of laws and policies is hampered by less prioritization on the importance of R&D and limited staff with competent legislative research skills.

**Inadequate exercise of oversight function.** The role of the oversight function is crucial to good governance and needs to be strengthened through appropriate parliamentary systems and procedures. With this, the Bangsamoro Parliament can ensure a balance of power and assert its role as the defender of people's interests. The Members of the Parliament (MPs) hold annual technical budget hearings in every ministry to ensure financial accountability. After the ministries' budget has been passed, the Bangsamoro Parliament has an important role to play in monitoring how the budget funds are spent. However, the Bangsamoro Parliament has an inadequate exercise of its oversight function because there is a lack of monitoring mechanism as to how the budget is being utilized.

**Slow Committee process.** Committees are the principal forum for the discussion and deliberation of policies and conduct of oversight activities. Having a strong committee system is an important determinant of the effectiveness of a Bangsamoro Parliament in implementing its powers. In order for the MPs to effectively perform their duties, the Bangsamoro Parliament must be able to provide them with support and information they need. However, slow committee processes occur due to weak implementation of committee system, limited technical expertise, competing schedules for the conduct of committee activities and public consultations on policy, and absence of internal rules and regulations for some committees.

### Fiscal Management

The following are the key challenges of fiscal management to be addressed in 2023-2028:

As it envisions a strong foundation of inclusive, transparent, accountable, and efficient governance founded on the idealism of moral governance, the BARMM takes on the responsibility to promote honest, efficient, and responsible fiscal management and fund utilization. While in a transition period, the government herald towards strengthening the foundations of sound fiscal policies, responsive budget process, and accountable safekeeping of Bangsamoro resources.

For its first three years of operations, the Bangsamoro government, through its interim ministries committed to fortify the standards and policies which are carefully and judiciously crafted in the context of Bangsamoro experience. The extension of the transition period is seen to be an opportunity for the BARMM to set a clear path and steer the government towards recovery and sustainability for the years to come.

Amidst these initiatives, the government still acknowledges its rudimentary experience in public financial management. For the past two fiscal years, the executive part of the government has experienced the challenge of achieving and maintaining satisfactory budget utilization rates. This may be primarily attributed to the continuing study to improve the efficient strategies in expenditure management. This core problem is brought about by some essential factors such as planning, implementation mechanisms, and procedures involved in fiscal management.

**Limited technical know-how in program budgeting.** One of the seen challenges in the implementation and fund utilization for the first three years of BARMM operation is the limited technical know-how in program budgeting. The BARMM adopts the national policy of cash-based budgeting, limiting the coverage of obligation to one fiscal year only, which enjoins government institutions to be more proactive in their expenditures through optimized planning and ensuring of implementation readiness of programs and projects. Understandably, the BARMM MOAs are only starting to build the foundation of its respective organization. Nevertheless, impactful results and service delivery may only be achieved through improvement in the efficiency in program budgeting.

**Manual budget processing.** Due to the advancement of technology, manual budget processing has been a problem in different organizations nowadays. Limited IT infrastructure, no new government accounting system (e-NGAs), budget and treasury management system (BTMS), unified reporting system (URS), and lack of IT experts on automated budget processing are some of its roots.

There is yet an established system for government accounting or cash management which may have some effect in the delayed implementation of programs and projects. This problem, however, is multi-faceted as it can be attributed to the lack of an efficient IT infrastructure, low connectivity, and expertise in terms of system development. Most notably, the lack of catch-up plan and insufficient capacity of program implementers in the face of natural and man-made calamities contribute greatly to the low absorptive capacity and flexibility of the implementing BARMM MOAs.

**Lack of fiscal and monetary policy.** Policies are relevant to organizations as it guides its operation. However, lack of fiscal and monetary policy has been a problem in the region as up until now there is no revenue and investment code, this might be due to lack of expert adept at BARMM context, lack of prioritization, and lack of an appropriate mechanism that would enable LGUs to generate locally sourced revenue.

Lack of expertise and awareness of Islamic finance is also a factor that can be attributed to the lack of intervention to promote financial literacy (on financial and monetary policies), poor information dissemination on financial literacy and inclusion, and less local public investment.

**Fluctuating rates in local revenue generation.** Although the collections for regional fees and charges have continuously increased in 2021, the collection in regional wealth tax and contractors has decreased, thus making the collection performance short by five percent. The restrictions from the COVID-19 pandemic affected the procurement of infrastructure projects, thus, what was disbursed during the year was mainly from the mobilization fees and some contracts have not been awarded. Thus, the collection of contractors' taxes was not maximized. The collection of regional wealth tax on the other hand is dependent on the production of mines. This type of collection is not stable due to the varying amount of mining production.

**Weak planning, programming, and budgeting linkages.** There is seemingly fragmented planning, programming, and budgeting linkages. This is manifested through the lack of mechanisms like a joint committee or body composed of the planning and financial offices, absence of long-term strategic plans, and limited convergence interventions. This is further weakened by the fast turnover of employees and slow hiring process. Another is the limited technical budgeting capacity due to changes in financial practitioners.

**Delayed implementation of PPAs.** There are several factors that hinder the timely implementation of PPAs which include unpreparedness for internal and external adversities due to lack of catch-up plan, overlapping of implementation schedule of several PPAs, limited technical capacity on program implementation, inadequate staffing and weak structure, and slow hiring process.

Improving the cash management is another concern caused by lack of an automatic reversion system (treasury). The MDS used by the national government in disbursement of funds is a good government practice that is yet to be exercised in the BARMM. Moreover, exploratory talks have been kickstarted with the government servicing bank which is aimed at improving the cash management of the region.

Lastly, the delayed submission of reportorial documents also contributes to the disparity in actual expenditure and monitoring records. The regional government is expected to consolidate reportorial requirements to streamline financial data needed for the presentation of a credible financial position.

### Multi-stakeholder Engagement

The following are the key challenges of multi-stakeholder engagement to be addressed in 2023-2028:

**Differences in approaches and strategies in governance of the political leaders.** There have been these differences in approaches and strategies in governance of leaders because of their differences in political creed and affiliation.

**Poor inclusivity and access to information.** It is being observed that the whole-of-society approach is not adopted due to lack of policy on Rules of Engagement and non-recognition of the expertise of non-state actors. There is also limited public access to information on government processes due to poor implementation of freedom of information (FOI).

### Bangsamoro Justice System

Strengthening the multi-justice system in the BARMM is crucial to ensure inclusive coverage among the diverse communities in the region. The BARMM is composed of a culturally diverse population which requires the Bangsamoro government to implement an inclusive justice system.

Under RA 11054, "The Parliament shall adopt measures to ensure mutual respect and protection of the distinct beliefs, customs, and traditions of the Bangsamoro people and the other inhabitants in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region." The BOL guarantees the protection of the rights of the people in the region.

The following are the key challenges of the BJS to be addressed in 2023-2028:

**BJS not fully implemented in the BARMM.** As provided in Article X of the BOL, the BJS shall be administered in accordance with the unique cultural and historical heritage of the Bangsamoro and shall be in consonance with the Constitution, Shari'ah, traditional or tribal laws, and other relevant laws. The Bangsamoro government is yet to establish and operationalize the BJS structure in the region.

**Lack of Shari'ah judges and personnel for Shari'ah courts.** In 2019, the JBC has created 48 SCC under the jurisdiction of the SDC in the BARMM. While only 33 of the SCC are organized, and 15 are not yet organized which are situated in Tawi-Tawi and Basilan provinces. There is a necessity of establishing additional Shari'ah courts within and outside the region. During the BJS subsector consultation, it was mentioned that the reason why the Supreme Court did not establish additional Shari'ah courts is because of the lesser statistics of cases recorded. Another factor contributing to the lack of Shari'ah judges and personnel for Shari'ah Courts is the inorganization of the Integrated Shari'ah Bar of the Philippines.

**Less prioritization on Shari'ah capacity development.** There is less priority on capacity development on Shari'ah resulting to lesser number of capacitated Shari'ah practitioners. Also, the lack of training hampered the gradual appointment of qualified Shari'ah judges.

Presently, the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF) is the only recognized institution by the Supreme Court of the Philippines to facilitate training on Shari'ah subjects which is included in the requirements for taking the Special Shari'ah Bar Examination. However, the NCMF training is very limited in the number of slots for their accommodation. Meanwhile, being a college graduate with a bachelor's degree in Shari'ah is not sufficient for taking the special bar examination as they also need to undergo training from the NCMF to secure a certificate from the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court through the Office of the Bar Confidant conducts the Special Shari'ah Bar Examination only once every two years upon the request of the Secretary/ Chief Executive Officer of the NCMF.

As a result, there is inadequate pool of highly specialized and qualified Shari'ah practitioners in the BARMM to fill in the vacant plantilla positions in the Shari'ah courts.

**Slow implementation of BOL provision on BJS.** Reiterated in Title V, Section 12B of the BAA 13, Shari'ah Public Assistance Office will be headed by a director assisted by two counselors who are members of the Philippine Shari'ah Bar and they shall be assisted by an immediate staff. The director and two Shari'ah counselors shall be appointed by the Chief Minister. The Shari'ah Public Assistance Office is mandated to provide free legal assistance to poor or indigent party litigants.

Currently, the Shari'ah Public Assistance Office has not been fully established and operationalized. No resolutions to facilitate the immediate organization of the office that would primarily provide free legal assistance to indigent party litigants; prepare and file petitions, complaints, and/or responsive pleadings, and represent indigent defendants in ordinary civil actions, special civil actions, special proceedings and in any stage criminal proceedings before the Shari'ah Courts.

The same applied to the Office for Traditional Justice System. As per Section 27, D of the BAA 13, the Office for Traditional Justice system will be the primary responsible for overseeing the study, preservation, and development of traditional or tribal justice systems within the BARMM and it shall be attached to the OCM. Up to this date, these offices have not yet been brought before the Bangsamoro Parliament.

Full implementation of these laws will significantly increase access to the justice system and swift resolution of disputes, especially among the poor and marginalized groups. In return, it will increase the trust and confidence of the public. Greater access to justice comes with immense benefits for societies, including improving social cohesion and people's well-being.

**Absence of BTA Legislation on the implementation of the Bangsamoro Justice System.** The absence of policy issuance or support for the complementation of the multi-judicial system of the Bangsamoro may cause confusion to the people in determining the applicable laws to their concerns, given the multi-racial occurrence in the BARMM.

The multi-judicial system in the Bangsamoro is composed of the Shari'ah, Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), Customary Laws, Tribal, and Regular Courts. The inadequacy in the awareness of this multi-judicial system leads to a very low public trust in the justice system that may cause community disorder and conflicts. Poor people tend to put the law into their own hands and refuse to elevate the case to the proper court.

In the case of ADR, there are no funds allocated for the Council of Elders to motivate them in resolving disputes. As a result, they are not interested in the arising altercations in their surroundings which lead to serious conflicts. Moreover, the Council of Elders is not properly identified to preserve their status in their community.

**Weak coordination among the five pillars of the justice system: Law enforcement, prosecution, courts, correction, community.** The BARMM needs a strengthened five pillars of the Criminal Justice System (CJS) for a just, inclusive, and accessible Philippine judicial system. The Criminal Justice System (CJS) shall consist of a series of actions, tasks, or activities that will constitute the formal response to perceived law-and-order issues: crime prevention and reduction; the arrest and prosecution of suspects; and the hearing of criminal cases by the courts.

According to the assessment of PDP 2023-2028, despite the positive developments, there are still lacking in the policy reforms and key legislations. The CJS in the Philippines is composed of five pillars - law enforcement, prosecution, the courts, correction, and the community. It was found out in the PDP that the fragmentation of the CJS remains a challenge; backlogs in resolving cases, delays caused by inefficient practices, and aging persist; limited resources weaken the justice sector; and low public confidence in the justice system undermines the rule of law. Also, there is a possibility of undue administration of justice such as the absence of preliminary investigation, untimely or no delivery of subpoena, no arraignment, and other due processes.

These problems mainly affect the implementation of programs and strengthening coordination. In the BARMM, the surging number of crimes keep on flashing on the news, but the authorities would only say that the proper investigation will be done. What the people want to see is minimal crime incidence. The prompt action of the authorities in the repression of criminals must be strengthened. The coordination among pillars of the justice system shall be strengthened to oversee the implementation of strict monitoring of the progress of the cases and imposing penalties on erring lawyers.

The court pillar plays a major role in the resolution of cases. They shall carefully evaluate the information and pieces of evidence before pursuing a hearing and rendering a final judgment. In this pillar, the number of cases also affects the functions of the judges such as the speedy trial. This requires sufficient facilities and an increased number of judges to facilitate the adjudication of cases. Furthermore, the court shall strengthen its coordination among other pillars for the proper administration of justice.

The necessity of strengthening the administration of justice to prevent injustices in the future is also crucial. There are cases that reached the Supreme Court petitioning for the grave abuse of discretion of the judges. Hence, a policy strengthening the coordination and monitoring mechanism for the administration of justice is indispensable.

The first to uphold the law is the law enforcement pillar. It represents public authority and is in charge of preserving public safety and order. This pillar must remain strong in order for the populace to be responsive and involved in achieving due process. The BARMM is responsible for closely monitoring law enforcement activities and enforcing sanctions for improper use of force.

There is a real pushback in the correction pillar. The rampant crimes in the BARMM could be an implication of the failure of reformation and rehabilitation of the offenders. The Bangsamoro government shall provide support to the programs and projects for reformation and rehabilitation in preventing recidivism cases. Additionally, those found guilty of ta'azir charges, which are minor infractions punishable by Shari'ah courts, must be imprisoned in separate institutions while serving their terms in order to avoid further influence from those with major offenses and to ensure their prompt reformation.

The LGUs as part of the community pillar plays a major role in the development of the justice system in the Bangsamoro. The MILG-BARMM as its counterpart is mandated to promote peace and order, ensure public safety, and further strengthen local government capability aimed toward the effective delivery of basic services to the citizenry. Through LGUs, the Bangsamoro government can contribute to easy access of the poor or vulnerable groups to justice.

Also, poor litigants' access to available legal services may be hampered by a lack of awareness on their part. The costs incurred during hearings and other legal proceedings are another common factor that contributes to injustices.

Furthermore, there should be a mechanism for inter-agency dialogue and coordinated implementation of reforms in the justice system.

## Priority Policy and Legislative Agenda

**Bangsamoro Revenue Code.** This shall cover taxing powers of the Bangsamoro Government, in accordance with the Constitution and the BOL.

**Bangsamoro Investment Code.** This shall cover the matters relating to investments and incentives regulations that will be applied in the Bangsamoro Region.

**Bangsamoro Budget System Act.** This shall provide for the creation of the Bangsamoro Budget Office (BBO) under the control and supervision of the MFBM, and is primarily mandated to promote the sound, efficient, and effective management, and utilization of all resources of the Bangsamoro Government.

**Bangsamoro Islamic Banking and Finance.** This covers matters pertaining to legal and regulatory framework for Islamic Banking and Finance in Bangsamoro, recognizes the vital role of Islamic banking and finance in creating opportunities for greater financial inclusion, and discusses this system of finance based on Islamic law.

**Bangsamoro Local Governance Code.** This shall provide for a more responsive and accountable local government structure instituted through a system of decentralization whereby constituent local government units shall be given more powers, authority, responsibilities, and resources in a gradual and systematic approach.

This policy agenda intends to support sub-sector objectives on strengthening the delivery of public service; and strengthening and enhancing local government administration and supervision; as well as in achieving the ideal functionality and performance of LGUs.

**Bangsamoro Electoral Code.** This code is proposed to be promulgated to prescribe the structural, functional, and procedural principles in the elections of officers within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, and secure honest, credible, just, and free elections thereby allowing democratic political participation and reflecting the genuine will of the electorate.

**Enactment of Bangsamoro Code of Muslim Personal Laws.** This priority legislative agenda tends to enforce and harmonize the application of laws in all Shari'ah Courts in the Philippines. This will pave way in establishing and operationalizing the structures of BJS in the BARMM and will set in motion an institutionalized coordination mechanism between the Supreme Court of the Philippines and the Bangsamoro government.

Presidential Decree 1083 provides for the general enactment on Administration of Muslim Personal Laws. The Code of Muslim Personal Laws (CMPL) refers to the law that governs the family and personal relations of the Muslim Filipinos. This decree recognizes the legal system of Muslims in the Philippines as part of the law of the land, codifies Muslim personal laws, and provides for the administration and enforcement of the Code through the establishment of Shari'ah courts.

**Codification of ADR mechanisms in resolving tribal disputes.** The Codification of the ADR will pave way to the use of the alternative dispute system as well as the establishment or appointment of focal office to implement the ADR. ADR has emerged as the key to decongesting court dockets. It's a process or procedure used to resolve a dispute or controversy, other than by adjudication of a presiding judge of a court or an officer of a government agency in which a neutral third party participates to assist in the resolution of issues. There are three types of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms: conciliation, mediation, and arbitration incorporating provisions that will strengthen the partnership among BARMM MOAs and other non-state actors.

**An enabling law for open governance.** Inspired by the Open Government Partnership initiative, the concept of Bangsamoro open governance is committed to the principles of inclusive participation, promoting transparency, fighting corruption, empowering the Bangsamoro people and leveraging on technology to strengthen local moral governance. The values of transparency and open government is crucial to make government information more accessible and available through the use of technology to ensure accountability.

This policy agenda intends to support the sub-sector objective of strengthening transparency and accountability mechanisms for a more inclusive and open participation in governmental processes.

Fiscal openness will provide the platform to inform the Bangsamoro people and local and international partners on regional and local governance, maximize engagement and establish citizen feedback mechanisms to help fight corruption.

**Strengthen the standardization of monitoring and evaluation mechanism of the Bangsamoro Government and Local Development Council of BARMM LGUs.** The standardized M&E mechanism shall provide a scheme for the Bangsamoro government and Local Development Council in monitoring and evaluation of development programs or projects in the BARMM.

**Bangsamoro Government Communications Policy.** This encompasses the central objectives and principles for the Bangsamoro government's communication with its constituents, civil society organizations, academe, businesses, and other stakeholders.

# Chapter 6: Mainstreaming of Bangsamoro Cultural Diversity, Beliefs, Heritage, and Identity

Section 24, Article IX of RA 11054 known as the BOL provides that the Bangsamoro government shall preserve the history, culture, arts, traditions, and the rich cultural heritage of the Bangsamoro people and their Sultanates, such as those of Sulu, Maguindanao, Kabuntalan, Buayan, the Royal House of Ranao and of the Iranun, and the non-Moro indigenous peoples of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

Pursuant to the said provision of the BOL, the Bangsamoro government identified Bangsamoro culture, heritage, identity, and diversity as the twelfth priority of the enhanced 12-Point Priority Agenda of the BARMM. This chapter aims to contribute in Agenda No. 7 of the 8-Point Socioeconomic Agenda of the Marcos Administration, and SDGs 10, 11, and 17.

This Chapter discusses the current situation, priority challenges, and opportunities for the preservation and promotion of identity and diverse culture in BARMM. It also sets forth the goal, objectives, strategies, and priority interventions laid out by the Bangsamoro government for the next six years. This features the unique culture and identity of the BARMM.

## Sectoral Assessment

### Sectoral Trends

**Bangsamoro culture and identity recognized.** The term Moro is a diverse category, with great variation culturally and linguistically, as well as in religiosity and the adherence to Islamic teachings (Paredes, 2015). It was initially a derogatory term applied by the Spanish colonizers who battled the 'Moors' in the Iberian Peninsula - modern Spain and Portugal, implemented aggressive anti-Muslim policies.

The Maguindanaon, Meranao, Iranun or Iranaun, Tausug, Yakan, and other cultural groups retain distinct traditions and identities, their shared historical identification with Islam and a shared history of being targeted by colonial and post-colonial state persecution (ibid). Over time, the term Moro was eventually embraced as a collective identifier. Most recently, the term is prefixed by the Malay word "Bangsa", which means nation, to suggest a collective name for all Moro peoples in the Philippines and their homeland.

The Bangsamoro diverse culture and identity have been historically recognized in different literatures as basis of identifying and naming the sea between the island of Mindanao and Palawan as Sulu Sea, the country's largest gulf located in the off coast of Mindanao as Moro Gulf and, a large bay of the Moro Gulf, off the southwestern coast of Mindanao island as Ilana Bay, also known as the Iranun/Iranaun Bay. In fact, the island of Mindanao was identified and named as Moro land during the American regime. It was administered separately from the islands of Visayas and Luzon until the promulgation of the 1935 Philippine Constitution despite the vehement resistance of the Bangsamoro.

Bangsamoro culture and identity is also legally recognized through the provision of the 1987 Constitution particularly Article X, Section 15, which provides among others that "There shall be created an Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao." Presidential Decree 1083 was decreed allowing the Muslims to exercise their own law on personal and property relation other than the Philippine Civil Code. This led to the creation of Shari'ah legal system including Shari'ah Courts in the country.

Another recognition is the establishment of Ministry of Muslim Affairs (MMA) by virtue of EO 697 issued on May 28, 1981, which was replaced by the Office on Muslim Affairs (OMA) two months later to minimize the number of ministries at that time. It was replaced by the National Commission of Muslim Filipinos (NCMF) by virtue of RA 9997 known as National Commission on Muslim Filipinos Act of 2009. Eventually, the enactment of RA 6734 as amended by RA 9054 and finally eventual passage of RA 11054 known as the BOL.

**Appreciation of Bangsamoro culture and identity is gradually decreasing.** The Bangsamoro are known for their rich and distinct beliefs, culture, and identity for which they fought for and struggled many decades and even centuries before. The battle cry was "it is better to die than to have two identities". This means the Bangsamoro prefer to lose their lives rather than to surrender their identity as Muslim. This battle cry remains in the hearts of the Bangsamoro generation.

However, the Bangsamoro culture and identity that includes arts, sports, music, and others are not much appreciated nor practiced by most of the new generation nowadays due to exposure to foreign cultures, languages, and practices brought about by modern lifestyle and social inclination. They choose to busy themselves with the various social media and its fad than learning their own culture and identity.

**Traditional practices are becoming less popular and less visible.** Thirty years ago, the Bangsamoro traditional practices were common to everyone. On many occasions, the people gathered and feasted on special native delicacies as a gesture of kinship, unity, and solidarity. Indigenous musical instruments were abundant in the Bangsamoro areas. These handcrafted instruments were played during festivals and auspicious occasions. At present, they have become rare and authentic artists are difficult to find. Even worse, majority of the new generation have no knowledge about Bangsamoro history and traditional practices.

Before, the Bangsamoro customary laws of Walay na Bityara in Maguindanaons, Taritib ago Igma of Maranaos, Baitsyara of the people of island provinces and other customs and traditions are observed and effectively used as way of regulating societal affairs. Nowadays, it is very seldom to find someone adept with these customs and traditions.

**Traditional sports, arts, and music slowly forgotten.** With the advent of the modern sports and music coupled with the use of modern gadgets and instruments, the Bangsamoro traditional games, arts, and music are slowly fading and being forgotten. The following are some of the waning Bangsamoro traditional sports and music:

### Table 6.1 Bangsamoro Traditional Sports and Music

| Bangsamoro Traditional Sports | Bangsamoro Traditional Music |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 1. Kakhoya or local version of Marathon (track and field) | 1. Kakholintang, kaagong, kadbak, kapamamundiran, kaphandaopan |
| 2. Kaphaso or local version of horse racing | 2. Kapangotyapi |
| 3. Kazipa sa Manggis for male | 3. Kapangobing |
| 4. Kazipa sa Lama for female | 4. Kapangintsi |
| 5. Kathakian for boys | |
| 6. Kathipho local version of long jump | |
| 7. Kambalintad for girls | |
| 8. Kambiko for girls and boys | |
| 9. Kanggalawanga | |
| 10. Kangalazoga | |
| 11. Kangugorowa | |

**Bangsamoro historical sites are given less importance thereby losing value and significance.** Due to the absence of consolidated and comprehensive Bangsamoro history; the advent of modernization, and the impact of climate change, the value and significance of the Bangsamoro historical sites are gradually disappearing. This is worsened by the absence of relevant regional policies on the preservation and development of historical sites and cultural heritage.

Under Section 26, Article IX of the BOL, the national government shall transfer the management of Bangsamoro historical and cultural sites currently under the jurisdiction of the National Museum of the Philippines, National Historical Commission of the Philippines, and other agencies of the national government to the Bangsamoro Commission for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage (BCPCH). This will be done through intergovernmental relations mechanisms. The BCPCH shall coordinate with relevant agencies of the national government on the regulation, excavation, and preservation of cultural artifacts and on the recovery of lost historical and cultural heritage.

**Tangible and intangible cultural heritages are vanishing.** Bangsamoro identity through visual and other forms of arts will be extinct sooner than our younger generations might realize. There is but limited knowledge on the historical significance of tangible cultural heritage and properties as well as the intangible cultures of the Bangsamoro. In addition to natural disasters, human-induced calamities threaten the destruction and loss of physical entities related to the uniqueness of the Bangsamoro culture. Being susceptible to transport, most of them were sold, transferred, lost, and gradually forgotten.

## Development Opportunities

**Existence of local cultural artists.** Local cultural artists are among the bearers of our cultures through arts. They are the catalysts of the Bangsamoro creative industry which is a growing field in global life. This industry will provide economic growth and decent work for the Bangsamoro cultural artists. In addition, local cultural artists contribute to sustainable tourism that promotes local culture and products. Hence, the remaining existing local cultural artist is a great opportunity in preserving and promoting Bangsamoro culture. They can be utilized as instruments to preserve and develop the cultural arts.

**Presence of cultural arts center.** Cultural centers are spaces for cultural heritage appreciation and artistic growing. It contributes to the efforts to protect and safeguard the Bangsamoro cultural heritage. Moreover, the presence of cultural centers in the region is another opportunity to preserve, develop, and promote culture, and further contribute to sustainable tourism that provides economic opportunities.

**Presence of schools of living tradition (SLT).** In safeguarding intangible cultural heritage, SLT provide a venue to continue the transmission of knowledge to younger generation. It intends to develop traditional cultures such as arts or crafts. It also encourages the culture masters to continue their work in teaching and promoting the cultural heritage and raise more awareness to the community. The presence of SLT in the region provides an opportunity in preserving the Bangsamoro culture.

**Availability of cultural and historical reading material written in local language.** Bangsamoro languages are one of the endangered languages that believed to be lost in the next generation. In order to preserve this culture and its language, it is important to make them available in reading materials. Thus, Bangsamoro languages used in reading materials is an opportunity to transfer the knowledge of the language and culture to the young and the next generations.

## Priority Challenges to be Addressed Within 2023-2028

**Declining appreciation and valuation of Bangsamoro cultural heritage.** It is observed that some of the new generations are gradually losing their appreciation and valuation on culture and heritage. This is partly due to the absence of integrated and comprehensive Bangsamoro history that will help them understand the past and the journey of their forefathers. Another factor is poor promotion initiatives in multimedia, lack of reading materials, and other platforms. Thus, the value and appreciation of the Bangsamoro culture and heritage is declining in the region.

**Undermining Bangsamoro identity.** The Bangsamoro is an ethnolinguistic mosaic made up of at least 13 Islamized, non-Islamized, and indigenous groups. As envisioned in the peace agreements, measures to sustain long-term stability shall ensure the inclusion of the minorities, women, and youth. However, low initiatives and learning spaces to engage them in understanding the Bangsamoro history pose a greater challenge, and this weakens the foundation of cultural heritage and identity. Without a strong foundation, it contributes to low interest and awareness of Bangsamoro history and culture. Considering the important role of the youth in the preservation of culture and identity, there is a need to ensure transfer of knowledge and practices to the younger generation who will continue to preserve the Bangsamoro culture and identity.

**Insufficient resources for comprehensive Bangsamoro historical culture and identity.** Although majority of cultural heritage are informal, unprotected, and not explicitly managed, it plays a significant role in both economic and social life because they are the primary institutions that link people. The cultural backdrop of social existence is defined by history, territory, and society. To date, no institution has concentrated on Bangsamoro history intending to build a library of records, objects, and artifacts. Challenges include insufficient and limited inventory and resources encompassing the history, culture, and identity along with the limited number of Bangsamoro historians and cultural experts as well as limited innovative and creative platform to showcase the Bangsamoro culture and identity.

**Weak policies on cultural and historical preservation and innovation.** Currently, the BARMM is adopting the existing national policies on cultural preservation and development. This needs to be localized to promote the distinct culture of the region. Also, weak policies on cultural preservation and promotion can be attributed to limited coordination among BARMM MOAs, poor functionality of local council for culture and arts, non-mainstreaming of culture and identity to governance, lack of cultural product marketing, innovation, and incentives.
