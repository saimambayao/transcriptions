## Foreword

My warmest greetings to the officers, members, and staff of the Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority (BPDA) on the publication of the 2nd Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP) 2023-2028.

In keeping with your vision of becoming a premier center for socio-economic planning in the Bangsamoro region, I hope that the BDP 2023-2028 will serve as a guidepost as you address the most pressing problems that we face today. With your ability to formulate data-driven and research-based programs, you have the capacity to devise measures that are not only feasible, but also sustainable in the long run.

May this development plan also enable you to positively respond to the needs and expectations of Filipinos, filling the remaining gaps among our local sectors and boosting the progress of the BARMM and the entire country. I trust that it will further move our people to participate in strengthening our communities and reassuring that the government looks after their welfare as they cope with the changing realities of society.

Alongside your efforts to deliver quality services to the Filipino people, I am confident that your passion for service, love for fellows, and hope for the future will guide you in fortifying the key industries of our society. Rest assured that the administration is ever united with you in establishing a more informed, strategic, and progressive Philippines.

Congratulations on this accomplishment. Mabuhay tayong lahat!

## Message from NEDA

Living through a pandemic in this volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (or VUCA) world is a sure test of resilience and tenacity for all of us striving to bounce back from this unprecedented health and socioeconomic crisis. The challenge—as well as our plans and strategies—may have changed. Still, our long-term vision - the AmBisyon Natin 2040 — remains clear and firm: achieving a matatag, maginhawa, at panatag na buhay for all Filipinos by 2040.

Building upon the lessons learned in the last three years, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), in close coordination with other government agencies and stakeholders, formulated and completed the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2023-2028. As articulated in the Plan, our goal is to reinvigorate job creation and accelerate poverty reduction by steering the economy back to its high-growth path. We will work to achieve deep economic and social transformation for a prosperous, inclusive, and resilient society. Anchored on the 8-point Socioeconomic Agenda of President Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos, Jr., the PDP 2023-2028 contains strategies seeking to address both short-term challenges and medium-term constraints to economic growth. Short-term challenges, in particular, encompass concerns such as the rising prices of commodities due to global inflationary pressures, the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health and education, and the impact of global supply chain disruptions on employment and food security.

Addressing challenges of this magnitude requires a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach. The Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP) 2023-2028 is a testament to the region's commitment to transforming governance in Bangsamoro and harnessing the region's full potential in achieving economic transformation for prosperity, inclusivity, and resilience. On the other hand, the PDP highlights strategies to support a smooth and complete transition of the Bangsamoro government and strengthen intergovernmental coordination and collaboration.

Hence, I would like to convey my appreciation to the Bangsamoro Economic and Development Council for its commitment to formulating the BDP 2023-2028 and directing numerous regional development initiatives for an "empowered, cohesive, and progressive Bangsamoro." I would also like to thank the Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority for their participation in the formulation of the PDP. We look forward to a stronger, more productive partnership in the years ahead.

Finally, I call for the cooperation of our local government units, ministries and other offices, private institutions, non-government organizations, and members of civil society to join us in this collective endeavor. Through our united effort, we are a step closer to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, and resilient society in the BARMM and the whole country.

## Message from the Chief Minister

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem
Assalamu Alaykum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu!

In 2020, the Bangsamoro government formally launched the 1st Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP) 2020-2022, a three-year roadmap for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) which aims to uplift the lives of the Bangsamoro people and establish the foundations of self-governance. At the height of its implementation, the whole world was confronted by the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic - a global health crisis that brought enormous change to all aspects of life and our daily routines; our region, the BARMM, was no exception. Amid the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, BARMM's economic performance has increased despite being in a delicate transition period. According to the Philippines Statistics Authority (PSA), BARMM has recorded a significant rise in its economic performance by 7.5 percent in 2021 and a significant decline in poverty incidence since 2018.

However, the coverage of the 1st BDP ended on December 31, 2022. This prompted the interim Bangsamoro government to direct the Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority (BPDA), through the Bangsamoro Economic and Development Council (BEDC), to spearhead and jumpstart the initial assessment of the 1st BDP and 12-Point Priority Agenda as a preparation for the formulation of a successor plan.

During the process, the BEDC ensured an inclusive formulation of the 2nd BDP by soliciting inputs and recommendations from various stakeholders during the regionwide consultation in the region's mainland and island provinces. We consulted our provincial, city, and municipal local government units, academic institutions, business sector, and civil society organizations. As part of the extensive formulation of the 2nd BDP, series of workshops and writeshops which include the assessment of the 1st BDP and enhancement of the BARMM 12-Point Priority Agenda, as well as the simultaneous formulation of some essential documents such as the 1st Bangsamoro Ecological Profile (BEP), 1st BARMM Development Policy Research Agenda (BDPRA), and Bangsamoro Spatial Development Framework (BSDF).

After several months of arduously working on this document, it is with great pride and honor that I present the 2nd Bangsamoro Development Plan 2023-2028—a plan that will sustain the gains and pursue the development thrusts, priorities, and strategies of the Bangsamoro government that were outlined in the 1st BDP.

With its successful completion, I humbly acknowledge the contributions of all institutions who took part in crafting this development plan. This includes all the regional ministries, offices, and agencies of the BARMM and our ever-supportive development partners, The Asia Foundation (TAF), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and Support to Bangsamoro Transition (SUBATRA). I sincerely thank you all for your commitment and support. Indeed, with our collaborative efforts, we were able to craft a plan that will aid in transforming the Bangsamoro region by identifying durable solutions towards a smooth transition to normalization, sustaining peace, and attaining socioeconomic development in our region.

Finally, all praise and glory to Allah (SWT) for His grace and mercy over the Bangsamoro. May He continue to bless and guide us to implement this plan for the betterment of our beloved homeland and our people.

Shukran and Wassalam!

## Preface

Assalamu Alaykum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu.

All praises and thanks to the Almighty Allah (SWT) for the gift of wisdom and guidance to continue our commitment for the success of Bangsamoro including the completion of the 2nd Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP) 2023-2028, and its accompanying Results Matrices (RM), Bangsamoro Development Investment Program (BDIP), and BARMM Development Policy Research Agenda (BDPRA).

This successor plan of the 1st BDP 2020-2022 outlines the development priorities of the Bangsamoro government for its three-year extension period and beyond. It also serves as the basis for programming and utilization of the Special Development Fund (SDF) as provided under Article XIV, Section 2 of Republic Act (RA) No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL). It is also anchored to the 8-point socioeconomic agenda of the Marcos Administration, Philippine Development Plan (PDP), and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The 2nd BDP 2023-2028 consists of 14 chapters that highlights a broad, encompassing, and participatory planning methodology which focuses on the development agenda, thrusts, and priorities to address the significant challenges in the region.

The five sectoral planning committees of the BEDC namely: 1) Development Administration Committee (DACom), 2) Economic Development Committee (EDCom), 3) Social Development Committee (SDCom), 4) Infrastructure Development Committee (IDCom), and 5) Peace, Public Order, Safety and Security Committee (PPOSSCom) spearheaded the formulation of the plan through series of workshops, writeshops, and consultations involving the different BARMM ministries, six provinces (Maguindanao del Norte, Maguindanao del Sur, Lanao del Sur, Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi), three cities (Marawi City, Lamitan City, and Cotabato City), the Special Geographic Area (SGA), academe, and CSOs to ensure an inclusive, comprehensive, well-coordinated, and responsive medium-term plan that will guide the policymakers and development stakeholders in identifying strategies, and implement programs, and projects to attain the overall goal of the Bangsamoro region.

As the technical secretariat of the BEDC, the BPDA is honored to lead the successful formulation of the 2nd BDP 2023-2028, a plan that will continue the development initiatives of the Bangsamoro government to achieve an empowered, cohesive and progressive Bangsamoro.

Our deepest gratitude to our development partners and consultants for extending their full support since the beginning of the plan formulation process. May this strengthen our existing collaboration and partnership to realize our dreams and aspirations for the Bangsamoro.

Shukran and Wassalam!

# Chapter 1: BARMM and the Extended Transition

This chapter has three parts. The first part discusses the BARMM regional context before and the ongoing transition, the second part narrates the institutional context, and the third part talks about the extended transition and the salient features of the 2nd BDP 2023-2028.

## Regional Context

For decades, the region was in a "conflict trap", characterized by a sustained ebb and flow of violence that was precipitated by a myriad of actors, interests, triggers, and underlying causes. It was and still is in a fragile state. This fragility and the turbulent nature of the political landscape of the region came at a high cost: limited economic growth, a low level of human development, and gaps and disruptions in service delivery.

There were significant events aimed to have a lasting solution to these patterns of violence in the region. Among them include: the signing of the 1996 Final Peace Agreement (FPA) between the Government of the Philippines (GPH) and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) that led to the creation of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM); the signing of the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro (FAB) and the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB) between the GPH and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) under the Benigno Aquino administration; and, the ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) under the Duterte administration that replaced ARMM with BARMM as the new political entity.

The BOL and the installation of a new form of government signaled a new era in governance—Moral Governance. A 12-Point Priority Agenda was laid out with the intent of outlining the priorities within the transition period, which was then supported by the Bangsamoro Development Framework (BDF). This was later translated to a term-based plan called the 1st BDP which articulates moral governance in terms of sectoral outcomes, strategies, and priority programs, projects, and activities (PPAs).

The 1st BDP was an attempt to put in place a sense of predictability in the political and governance landscape of the region during the transition. It served as a development roadmap for the newly installed government and as a basis for annual programming and budgeting. It reflected the transformational results to be achieved within three years and the accompanying strategies, cognizant of the regional and institutional realities. As a regional plan, there was a deliberate effort to align with the PDP 2017-2022 and the 0-10 Socioeconomic Agenda of the Duterte administration.

Despite the significant promise and opportunities of the transition, its starting points were fraught with developmental and institutional challenges. These include: (1) high incidence of poverty; (2) lowest contribution to the national economy; (3) low performance outcomes on health and education; (4) continuing threats to peace, security, public order and safety; (5) insufficient infrastructure facilities; (6) vulnerability to climate change; (7) disruption in service delivery with the gradual phasing out of offices and personnel of the former ARMM; among others.

Based on the assessment of the BARMM performance, there were remarkable changes in the overall regional context. The region has high performance in achieving macroeconomic targets. Five out of six macroeconomic targets set in the 1st BDP were achieved.

### Table 1.1 Macroeconomic Targets set in the 1st BDP 2020-2022

| PERFORMANCE INDICATOR | BASELINE (as reflected in BDP) | END-OF-PLAN TARGET | STATUS | EVIDENCE/MOV |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GRDP Annual Growth Rate | 7.2% (2018) | 7.0% - 7.5% | 7.5% (2021) | Philippine Statistical Authority (PSA) Report |
| Population Growth Rate | 3.78% (2018) | 4.2% | 3.26% (2020) | PSA Report |
| Labor Force Participation Rate | 46.6% (2018) | 46.0% - 50.0% | 60% (2021) | PSA Report |
| Unemployment Rate | 3.7% (2018) | 3.0% | 7.60% (2021) | PSA Report |
| Inflation Rate | 7.09% (2018) | 4.5% - 5.0% | 2.40% (2021) | PSA Report |
| Poverty Incidence (among families) | 52.6% (2018) | 49.6% | 29.80% (2021) | PSA Report |

### Second fastest growing economy in the country

In 2021, BARMM registered 7.5 percent annual economic growth, the second highest growth rate in the country. It was a strong rebound from the -1.9 percent growth in 2020, which was largely caused by the pandemic. This is a strong manifestation that the region is on its way to recovery from the adverse effects of the pandemic.

In addition, BARMM is demonstrating to be moving at the same economic pace with its neighbors. The region registered the highest growth rate in 2017, 2018, 2020, and 2021 in Mindanao. At the time of the pandemic, it registered a decline of -1.9 percent, the lowest among the Mindanao regions.

Even though the BARMM's economic growth is at par with the national average, the regional contribution to national economic output is lowest at 1.4 percent.

### Structural transformation in BARMM's economic landscape

Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing (AFF) used to be the leading sector in BARMM 20 years ago, accounting for more than half of the region's economic output. The industry sector had the lowest contribution, accounting for less than 10 percent of the region's economic output.

A structural change is observed in the past 20 years. By 2021, the services sector replaced AFF as the leading sector, accounting for 36.41 percent of the region's economic output. But a dramatic leap was observed in the industry sector, which grew from 8.13 percent in 2000 to 24.65 percent in 2021 in terms of percentage share. This, however, does not indicate that the AFF has been weakening for the past years. This only indicates that the region is heading towards a balanced economy with the three main sectors moving and contributing significantly to the region's economic output.

### Figure 1.1 GRDP Percent Share, by sector, BARMM, 2000 vs. 2021

**2000:**
- Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing: 55.75%
- Industry: 8.13%
- Services: 36.12%

**2021:**
- Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing: 38.94%
- Industry: 24.65%
- Services: 36.41%

### Historic drop in the incidence of poverty in BARMM

Poverty incidence in the region dropped from 54.20 percent (or 380,000 families) in 2018 to only 29.80 percent (or 230,000 families) in 2021. Despite this historic drop, poverty incidence in the region remains to be the highest in the country.

The massive drop in poverty in the region can be attributed to the double-digit percentage drop in Lanao del Sur, Sulu, Basilan, and Maguindanao. It was only the province of Tawi-Tawi that registered an increase in poverty incidence in the region.

### Figure 1.2 Poverty Incidence by Region, 2018 vs. 2021

| Region | 2018 | 2021 |
|---|---|---|
| BARMM | 54.20% | 29.80% |

### Recovery of tourism and investments from the ill-effects of the pandemic

The pandemic put the tourism sub-sector on a standstill in 2020, causing tourist arrivals to drop to as low as 7,332. But renewed confidence and interest was recorded in 2021 when tourist arrivals grew by more than a thousand-fold, which was 195,822. However, despite the monumental increase in 2021, the number is still far below as compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2018 and 2019.

Investments plummeted from Php4.153 billion in 2019 to only Php14.0 million in 2020 due to the restrictions caused by the pandemic. Though still in the pandemic stage, investments rose to Php2.8 billion in 2021, more than a thousand-fold increase as compared to 2020. Total investments generated from 2019 to 2021 reached Php6.970 billion, which generated 5,020 jobs.

### A gradual shift towards formalization among the MSMEs

In 2021, a total of 8,427 micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) have been registered - a 161.46 percent increase from the number in 2020. It is the highest in a span of five years. Such an increase was a manifestation of the resilience of the Bangsamoro entrepreneurs given the lingering effects of the pandemic.

For two years (2020-2021), BARMM has registered 11,650 businesses through its five provincial offices including Cotabato City, created 31,000 jobs and generated an investment of around Php2.5 billion.

Despite the significant increase in business name registrations (BNR) in 2021, BARMM registered the lowest BNRs in the country, accounting for only 0.92 percent.

### Gains in peace and security

Crime-related incidents, deaths, and displacement dropped to a record low during the transition. However, land conflicts intensified in selected areas in 2020, and rido-related incidents persisted at the time of the pandemic. These, however, did not affect the overall regional stability. Generally, there is relative peace and security in the region during the transition period.

Threats to violent extremism remain endemic in selected localities, and challenges to pernicious shadow economies such as illicit firearms and illegal drug trade remain significant and require immediate attention and action in terms of policy and local support.

### Challenges in education and health outcomes remain impervious

Education performance outcomes in the region are still lowest in the country, and these have been further exacerbated by the pandemic. There was a significant learning loss in 2020 and 2021 as restrictions were imposed to protect the learners. A total of 143 barangays are considered school-less, and thousands of Madrasahs remain unaccredited, implying limited access to government support.

Access to public hospitals, rural health units (RHUs), barangay health stations (BHSs), and medical practitioners remains limited in the region, causing high rates of maternal mortality, infant mortality, and morbidity rates. Nutrition is also a gap, as the region registered the highest malnutrition rate. Access to basic safe water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities is the lowest in the country, explaining the high stunting rate and morbidity rate among children.

### Increasing vulnerability to the effects of climate change

The region is increasingly becoming vulnerable to natural calamities, particularly flooding in low-lying areas, resulting in deaths, displacement, and loss of properties. The typhoon "Paeng" which hit the country on October 28, 2022 caused flooding and landslides, resulting in 61 deaths and homes covered in mud. The casualty in the region was the highest in the country.

## BARMM Institutional Context

### The birth of a new political entity

The passage of RA No. 11054 "An Act Providing for the Organic Law for the BARMM, repealing for the purpose RA No. 6734 as amended by RA No. 9054, entitled 'An Act to Strengthen and Expand the Organic Act for the ARMM,'" paved the way for the establishment of a new political entity. On July 27, 2018, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte signed it into law, and was ratified through a plebiscite in early 2019. The ratification of RA No. 11054, also known as the BOL, commenced the transition of the defunct ARMM into the BARMM, a new autonomous regional government.

### A shift in the system of governance

The birth of this new political entity was confronted with various challenges, specifically with changes in government structure and political leadership. A unitary system of governance was adopted by the ARMM government. However, with the change of political entity through the ratification of the BOL, the Bangsamoro government is currently adopting a parliamentary system of governance in running the BARMM. Indeed, birthing pains in establishing this new political entity are being endured by the Bangsamoro government, which started with the shifting of the system of governance during the transition of the ARMM to BARMM.

### Transitioning from ARMM to BARMM, the appointment of interim officers, and the execution of powers

As stated in Article XVI, Section 1 of RA No. 11054, the transition period for the establishment of the BARMM commenced upon the ratification of the BOL. BARMM seeks to foster genuine autonomy, moral governance, and improve fiscal management in the region. However, the transition from ARMM to BARMM is a very significant change that brings enormous challenges to the Bangsamoro government.

Following the ratification of the BOL was the creation of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) as the interim government in the BARMM, holding both legislative and executive powers during the transition period.

President Rodrigo R. Duterte appointed Ahod B. Ebrahim as the interim Chief Minister of the Bangsamoro government, bearing the executive power and authority over the region, while Atty. Pangalian M. Balindong was appointed as the BTA Parliament Speaker along with the other members of the Parliament holding the legislative power and authority in the BARMM.

Thereafter, Chief Minister Ahod B. Ebrahim submitted to the BTA Parliament a transition plan last June 17, 2019, that served as the initial basis and guide for the organizational plan, schedule of phasing out of employees, and other transition mechanisms of the six priority codes. The proposed transition plan was voted on by the majority of the Members of Parliament, and thus, approved by the BTA Parliament. With its approval, the Bangsamoro government began organizing the interim Cabinet, but the implementation of the transition plan affected the usual government operations, which hampered the delivery of services across the region. On the other hand, the transition period shall end upon the dissolution of the BTA as provided in the BOL.

### Phasing out of ARMM offices, separation of ARMM personnel, and transfer of powers and properties

The commencement of the transition signaled a full transfer of powers, functions, and properties of the ARMM government to the BARMM government, except for those properties, land, and structures located outside the ARMM. All ARMM offices were deemed abolished upon ratification of the BOL, resulting in the reorganization of the bureaucracy. The Bangsamoro government was able to implement the gradual phasing out of employees. However, this also caused a minimal disruption in the continuity of government services.

Further, the disposition and separation from government service also brought confusion to the majority of ARMM personnel. Nevertheless, the Bangsamoro government executed Section 10, Article XVI of RA No. 11054 which states that "All affected personnel who will not be absorbed in the positions of the new staffing pattern of the different offices in the Bangsamoro government, whether hired on a permanent, temporary, casual, or contractual basis and with appointments attested by the Civil Service Commission (CSC), shall be entitled to applicable retirement or separation benefits as provided in this Organic Law." Therefore, retired and separated ARMM personnel were given due compensation for the services they had rendered to the government.

In consideration of the public interest and continuity in the delivery of services, ARMM officials holding appointive positions were retained to continue performing their functions in accordance with the phase-out schedule. Despite retaining those officials, most of the offices faced difficulties especially with the technical and field operations because many employees from the defunct ARMM were not retained nor absorbed by their office.

Meanwhile, the employees coming from the sectors of health, education, and social welfare have been absorbed and transferred to the Bangsamoro government.

### Organization of bureaucracy—merging, restructuring, and creation of new offices in the BARMM

Even being guided by the transition plan, the merging and restructuring of offices connotes major changes in operations and services. The mandates of the offices being merged and restructured became bigger, yet the number of employees did not equate to the number of jobs to be done to effectively implement the mandate of the merged offices.

Among the merged and restructured offices are the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education (MBHTE), Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Agrarian Reform (MAFAR), Ministry of Trade, Investments, and Tourism (MTIT), Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources, and Energy (MENRE), and Ministry of Finance and Budget and Management (MFBM).

### Hiring of new BARMM personnel

With the organization of the new bureaucracy, the BTA has established an independent, strictly merit-based and credible placement and hiring process in all BARMM MOAs. The Bangsamoro Job Portal—an online platform where all applicants have equal opportunity to apply for any vacant positions in different ministries, offices, and agencies of the Bangsamoro government—was established.

As of December 2022, the Bangsamoro government received more than 600,000 job applications for around 7,725 positions posted on the Bangsamoro Job Portal. Aside from the plantilla posted in the job portal, there are thousands of job orders and contracts of services in different MOAs that are not posted in the said portal. This high volume of hopefuls vying for a position in the BARMM was overwhelming as it reflected their desire to be part of the Bangsamoro government.

Given this figure, the Bangsamoro government was receiving a backlash from the public, particularly from the applicants who were inquisitive about the hiring process. Currently, most of the vacant and available positions posted in the portal were already filled up.

### Inclusion of Cotabato City and SGA to the BARMM

Following the passage and ratification of the BOL, Cotabato City and SGA formed part of the Bangsamoro territory after they favorably voted for inclusion in the BARMM during the plebiscite.

The Bangsamoro government faced challenges in the inclusion of these areas in the regional planning and budgeting processes due to delays in the formal turnover of these areas to BARMM and perceived resistance of the City Government of Cotabato pending the decision for the protest they filed before the Supreme Court.

However, the Bangsamoro government was able to surpass these concerns through the issuance of an Executive Order (EO) issued by the Chief Minister on January 20, 2020, creating the Development Coordinating Office (DCO) tasked to administer the planning and implementation of PPAs of the MOAs in the SGA.

Further, Cotabato City officially became part of the BARMM on December 15, 2020 after a formal turnover of the supervision of Cotabato City to BARMM by the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Central Office.

## The BARMM extended transition

President Duterte signed on October 28, 2021 the law extending the transition period of BARMM from 2022 to 2025, thereby postponing the first regional parliamentary elections in the region. RA No. 11593 stipulates that the first parliamentary elections shall be held and synchronized with the 2025 national elections. It also stipulates that the BTA shall continue as the interim government during the extension of the transition period and the President may appoint the 80 new members of the BTA, who shall serve up to June 30, 2025 or until their successors shall have been elected. The BTA will continue to be MILF-led.

## The 2nd BDP 2023-2028

### Legal Basis

As the 1st BDP is now in its final term, the Office of the Chief Minister issued Memorandum Order No. 0092, directing all heads of ministries, offices, and agencies for the formulation of the 2nd BDP, Results Matrices (RM), and the Bangsamoro Development and Investment Program (BDIP) for 2023-2028. The 2nd BDP is envisioned to sustain the gains and pursue the development direction, priorities, and strategies outlined in the 1st BDP.

The formulation of the 2nd BDP commenced with the conduct of a rigorous review and assessment of the 12-Point Priority Agenda and the 1st BDP 2020-2022. The assessment findings and recommendations served as guideposts in the design of the 2nd BDP process.

### Approach

A whole-sector approach was adopted in the planning process. The five BEDC sectoral committees and special committee were the mechanisms tapped in the four phases of the planning process. The BPDA as the technical secretariat of the BEDC was instrumental in ensuring that the sectoral and special committees were mobilized in crafting the strategic directions of their respective sectors and assigned chapters.

### Cross-cutting themes

While moral governance is the overarching guiding principle, this is being operationalized in the 2nd BDP in terms of inclusion, equity, and justice. These three elements served as the cross-cutting themes and, to some extent, the guiding principles in crafting the strategic directions of the five sectors of the 2nd BDP.

### Planning Standards and Principles

**Building on the gains.** There was a recognition that key results, particularly outcomes, and the corresponding strategies in the 1st BDP are still relevant and significant for adoption in the 2nd BDP 2023-2028.

**BOL as the policy anchor.** The stipulations in the BOL served as the policy framework of the strategic directions in each of the sectors. As the framework, it provides the coverage or the limits in terms of rights, powers, and authority to exercise and the mechanisms and systems to create.

**Moral governance as the guidepost.** Moral governance continues to be the guidepost in terms of leadership and overall service delivery, but this will be operationalized through its cross-cutting themes of inclusion, equity, and justice for the next six years.

**Vertical and horizontal alignment.** There was a deliberate effort to ensure that the 2nd BDP was vertically aligned to the SDG, 8-point Socioeconomic Agenda of the Marcos administration, PDP 2023-2028, and the Mindanao Development Agenda. Coordination meetings were conducted with NEDA Central Office and NEDA Regional Office (NRO) XII. Close coordination was also conducted with MinDA to ensure alignment with the Mindanao Development Agenda. The Bangsamoro Spatial Strategy was a byproduct of such close coordination.

In terms of horizontal alignment, it was ensured that the 2nd BDP was able to translate the priorities set in the enhanced 12-Point Priority Agenda into specific strategies and initiatives. In addition, the ranked priority list of projects reflected in the BDIP was based on the list in the 2nd BDP. The annual priorities in the BDIP will be the basis for the Annual Investment Program (AIP), which will serve as the basis for the General Appropriations Act for the Bangsamoro (GAAB).

Coordination was conducted with several ministries for the sectoral plans such as the Gender and Development (GAD) plan, Disaster Risk Reduction and Management - Climate Change Adaptation (DRRM-CCA) plan, Camps Transformation Plan (CTP), Bangsamoro Food Security and Nutrition (BFSN) plan, among others, to ensure its alignment in terms of results, strategies, and priority programs and projects.

**Evidence-based.** Data from the different agencies with the mandate to produce official estimates were used in formulating the sectoral profile and trends. Majority of the data were taken from the PSA and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). Data systems of agencies such as the Enhanced Basic Education Information System (EBEIS) of the MBHTE and the Field Health Services Information System (FHSIS) of the Ministry of Health (MOH) were key sources of data.

Various literatures were also used to ensure that claims are supported with research or scientific inquiry.

**Strategic or critical thinking.** One of the biggest investments of this planning process was strategy formulation because strategies are the direct link between results and initiatives. Several consultations and workshops were conducted to ensure that the strategies formulated were not only effective in addressing the "wicked" problems but also have multiplier or cascading effects. Strategies are the link between the desired result and the interventions. There will be no program that will be implemented that is not anchored to a strategy. The sectoral committees referred to the clusters in the objective tree and formulated a strategy. Each strategy should be able to address multiple critical issues in the problem tree.

**Inclusive and participatory.** Consultations with the provincial, municipal, city, and barangay LGUs, CSOs, academe, private sectors, and other stakeholders were also conducted for an inclusive and participatory planning. The five sectors were meaningfully engaged in problem analysis, target setting and strategy formulation, investment programming, and results-based monitoring and evaluation.

### Strategic shifts from the 1st BDP

**Setting targets.** A shift from point estimate to a range of values was undertaken in setting targets to accommodate internal and external shocks that are oftentimes beyond government or state control. In addition, annual average growth rates as opposed to annual growth rate were used because the sustained or long-term performance is more critical as opposed to a one-time or annual performance. Further, measures of inequality and severity have been added as indicators of performance.

**Defining accountabilities.** The notion of "objectives" is being introduced in the 2nd BDP. This is to make the distinction which accountabilities are at the sectoral level, the sub-sector level, and at the institutional level.

**Emphasis on strategy.** Strategy is treated as the unifying element as this is the direct link between targeted results and the initiatives. This implies that no program or project will be proposed and implemented that is not anchored to a development strategy. The strategies have been instrumental in promoting vertical and horizontal alignment. This also implies that regional strategies have to be at some points supporting international and national strategies. Likewise provincial, city, and municipal strategies have to be supporting regional strategies. Contextualization can be done in terms of programs and projects, but alignment at the strategy level must be pursued.

### Process

**Assessment of 12-Point Priority Agenda and the 1st BDP.** In anticipation to update the 12-Point Priority Agenda and the formulation of a successor plan of the 1st BDP, the BEDC sectoral committees started a series of assessment activities in January 2022.

**Issuance of memorandum.** Memorandum Circular No. 0092 was issued on May 16, 2022, directs the BEDC through its five sectoral committees to spearhead the 2nd BDP formulation process with assistance from the BPDA being the technical secretariat. The said memorandum also mandates the BEDC sectoral committees to initiate and draft the BDIP and the RM as accompanying documents.

**Situational analysis and problem analysis.** Several studies and assessment reports were used in formulating the sectoral profile and trends. The five BEDC sectoral committees underwent problem analysis using the Strength-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) analysis, Political-Economic-Sociological-Technological-Legal-Environmental (PESTLE), and the Problem Tree analysis as tools.

**Target setting and strategy formulation.** The five BEDC sectoral committees formulated the sectoral goals and objectives based on the Objective Tree analysis. The sectoral goal and objectives reflect the transformational results to be achieved by the end of 2028. This is supported by Indicator-Baseline-Target Matrix.

The biggest investment was strategy formulation because not only the strategies should be distinct from activities, but they should be able to demonstrate a cascading or broad-based effect. Strategies are the link between the desired result and the interventions. There will be no program that will be implemented that is not anchored to a strategy. The sectoral committees referred to the clusters in the objective tree and formulated a strategy. Each strategy should be able to address multiple critical issues in the problem tree.

**Investment programming.** The five BEDC sectoral committees underwent a rigorous prioritization process of projects using the Conflict-Compatibility-Complementarity Matrix, Urgency Test, and the Goal Achievement Matrix (GAM). The output was a ranked list of priority projects with individual and cumulative cost estimates. Stream 2 of investment programming was determining the investible funds and stream 3 delved into matching the fund requirements with projected funds available and deciding on financing options should the funds available are insufficient.

**Results-based monitoring and evaluation.** A Results Matrix (RM) was formulated that covers the full hierarchy of results with baseline, targets, and means of verification. The RM is being supported with a Performance Measurement System (PMS) to reflect the institutional accountabilities and arrangements.

**LGU consultations and validation.** Strategic directions reflected in the draft 2nd BDP were presented during the LGU consultations and validation workshops. These were participated by representatives of six provincial governments, three city governments, 75 municipal governments, 142 barangay governments, 49 CSOs, three academic institutions, five private sector organizations, and BARMM MOAs.

### Accompanying Documents

The 2nd BDP has three accompanying documents. These are:

**Bangsamoro Development Investment Program (BDIP).** The BDIP contains the list of priority programs and projects, financing options, and the development approach to be undertaken.

**Results Matrices (RM).** The RM presents the hierarchy of results with indicators and means of verification. It delineates levels of accountabilities at the sectoral level, sub-sector level, and at the institutional level.

**Bangsamoro Development Policy and Research Agenda (BDPRA).** The BDPRA contains a detailed accounting of policy research requirements that have to be pursued within the term of the 2nd BDP. It guides how the enabling environment can be further enhanced to push the reforms forward.

# Chapter 2: Regional trends and prospects for development

The next six years will hold several challenges for the BARMM as it navigates a critical transition period until 2025, while attempting to sustain the dividends of peace amidst tackling the hurdles brought by COVID-19 and the broader development challenges.

Several trends and developments at the global and regional levels have and may affect the region as well. It is therefore imperative that the Bangsamoro government takes these current and emerging trends into account when charting its development directions for the next six years.

As the BARMM works towards achieving an empowered, cohesive, and progressive Bangsamoro, it will have to strategically navigate through the political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental landscapes.

#### 7.9 million more people in BARMM by 2030, with the greatest increase in Lanao del Sur

BARMM's population is projected to reach 5,250,500 by 2030. This indicates a 1,986,400 increase in the population of the region in ten years.

### Table 2.3 BARMM Projected Population 2010-2030

| REGION | 2010 | 2015 | 2020 | 2025 | 2030 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Philippines | 93,135,100 | 101,562,300 | 109,947,900 | 117,959,400 | 125,337,500 |

*Source: PSA, 2010 Census-Based Population Projections*

Throughout the projection period (2010-2030), the population of the six provinces of BARMM would continue to increase, albeit at a slower rate. Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao del Norte and del Sur, and Sulu will contain more than 1 million people and have the largest populations by 2030, with 1.5 million, 1.4 million, and 1.1 million persons, respectively, by 2030. Populations of Tawi-Tawi and Basilan are expected to reach 588,500 and 497,900, respectively, in the said period.

#### Projected rapid growth of the working-age population

Overall, the projected population in BARMM from 2010 to 2030 will increase across broad age groups. Ages 0 to 14 will have a gradual but consistent growth in population over the projection period. By 2030, the number of people in this age group will increase to 1,843,400, a rise of approximately 457,000 individuals.

BARMM's working-age population (15-64 years old) is also expected to grow, reaching 3.2 million in 2030. This is an increase of 1.4 million people compared to 2010.

Moreover, the number of people in BARMM aged 65 and older is projected to expand four-fold, representing a jump from 53,500 individuals in 2010 to 202,200 in 2030. While the number of people within this age group is expected to increase continuously, it will not be able to keep up with the rapidly growing number of people of the working age. The number of women in BARMM between the ages of 15 and 49 is expected to show a consistent growth pattern, going from 838,000 in 2010 to 1,355,200 in 2030.

### Table 2.5 BARMM Projected Population by Selected Age Group, 2010-2030

| REGION | 2010 | 2015 | 2020 | 2025 | 2030 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pop 0-14 | 1,386,400 | 1,461,800 | 1,580,100 | 1,741,400 | 1,843,400 |
| Pop 15-64 | 1,824,200 | 2,173,900 | 2,517,600 | 2,839,600 | 3,204,900 |

*Source: PSA, 2010 Census-Based Population Projections*

Among the BARMM provinces, Lanao del Sur is projected to register the largest increase in the working-age population by 2030, growing from 512,100 in 2010 to 941,900. Maguindanao comes next and is projected to gain 913,600 in its working-age population throughout the projection period, followed by Sulu at 686,200.

Tawi-Tawi and Basilan are expected to experience slow but steady growth. Approximately 364,900 people will be working-age in Tawi-Tawi by 2030 from 210,500 in 2010. Over the next 20 years, Sulu will gain 264,900 people aged 15-64 years, growing from 421,300 in 2010 to 686,200 in 2030.

### Prospects

#### Reaping the demographic dividend

BARMM is well positioned for accelerated economic growth and social development as a result of the high percentage of its population in the working age group (15-64 years old) in 2020. The population projections (2010 to 2030) also signify the potential for BARMM to reap a demographic dividend.

The region's economic growth potential will likely be very high if this projected population growth is realized, especially for the working-age population, as there will be a greater number of people in the workforce relative to the number of dependents.

To reap the full benefits of a favorable age distribution, the Bangsamoro government must invest further in human capital development by assuring access to health care and quality education for all ages, as well as increasing opportunities for productive employment and decent labor.

## Political

### Trends

#### New leadership making headways

The Bangsamoro government is confronted with enormous challenges in setting up the necessary structures, processes, and mechanisms to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of services to the Bangsamoro. With a complex transition process, combined with the compounding effects of COVID-19, tackling the region's development challenges is doubly difficult for BARMM as a fledgling government.

Building a bureaucracy is not an easy task; however, the Bangsamoro government has been making significant strides in institution building. The Bangsamoro government has doubled its efforts to operationalize the newly established offices and fill key positions within the government. Subsequently, developing the capacities of new civil servants and newly established institutions will be a high priority for the new leadership. This is a critical component of this effort to cultivate effective public service.

#### Moral governance as an instrumentality for inclusion, equity, and justice

It has been a central component of the Bangsamoro government's efforts to create a more empowered, cohesive, and progressive Bangsamoro that has always put moral governance as a critical underpinning principle to ensure inclusivity, equity, and justice within the Bangsamoro.

#### Shift in the system of governance

The birth of this new political entity faced various challenges. Most notably, changes in government structures and political leadership. The ARMM adopted a unitary government system. However, with the change in political entity following the ratification of the BOL, the Bangsamoro government has adopted a parliamentary system in running the BARMM. As mentioned above, the Bangsamoro government is continuously strengthening its effort in establishing this new political structure.

#### Policy support in relation to fiscal autonomy in-place

According to Section 1, Article XII of the BOL, "The Bangsamoro Government shall enjoy fiscal autonomy with the end in view of attaining economic self-sufficiency and genuine development." This means that the Bangsamoro government has the power to create its own sources of revenue in addition to the equitable share in the national taxes from the national government and block grant and prepare its budget and allocate this revenue within the bounds of the BOL. The Bangsamoro government has now the power to pass annual regional appropriations law through the Parliament in accordance with the needs and priorities of the region.

Through the annual block grant, the national government can automatically provide a sum equal to 5 percent of the net national internal revenue tax collections generated by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and the Bureau of Customs (BOC). This is the fiscal autonomy granted to the Bangsamoro government to control over its appropriations.

In addition to the annual block grant, the Bangsamoro government's taxing powers have also been expanded. It shall have the power to levy taxes, fees, and charges, but are subject to provisions of the Organic Law. Other than tariff and customs duties, the Bangsamoro government shares in national government taxes, fees, and charges collected in the BARMM are increased to 75 percent, inclusive of the shares of its constituent LGUs.

#### LGUs' functionality and performance demonstrating progress

During the start of a transition of leadership from ARMM to BARMM, LGUs' functionality was recorded at 45 percent (or 56 LGUs) of the 123 LGUs in ARMM. The Ministry of Interior and Local Government (MILG) has strategized its implementation of PPAs that include the giving of incentives to performing local governments. The tool used by the ministry was the Performance Audit and Compliance Tracking System (PACTS).

In 2021, the functionality rate jumped to 80 percent, which is equivalent to 98 LGUs. This remarkable increase shows that the strategy of incentivizing the performing LGUs is a good way of enticing others to do the same. Incentives were given in the form of a project amounting to Php1.5 million. A menu of projects was also given for the performing LGUs to choose from such as support to social, education, revenue generation, and disaster-related projects.

The ministry treated it as its regular program that serves as a support mechanism to the Seal of Good Local Governance (SGLG) being implemented by the DILG. The BARMM recorded 28 LGUs as passers in the prestigious search for SGLG, making the region ranked 1st out of the six regions in Mindanao and ranked 3rd out of 17 regions in the Philippines that passed and awarded with SGLG.

### Prospects

#### The Bangsamoro Electoral Code and democratic process in BARMM

There is much anticipation about the passage of the Bangsamoro Electoral Code, which is perceived to pave the way for a more democratic and credible system of electoral processes in BARMM to ensure genuine, credible, free, open, and honest elections.

#### Towards a more stable and stronger bureaucracy

In the coming years, BARMM will be seeing a stable and stronger governance system with the amount of progress made and the continuing effort to build and strengthen the bureaucracy.

#### Policy support to harness revenue generation needed

BARMM's revenue generation capacity will be boosted by the passage of the Bangsamoro Revenue Code. It shall cover the taxing powers of the Bangsamoro government. The BARMM is optimistic that this Code will act as a catalyst for boosting revenue collection and enhancing the overall revenue generation, thereby contributing to the improvement of the quality of the delivery of services in the region.

#### Well-defined relationship between BARMM and its constituent LGUs

The Bangsamoro Local Government Code shall strengthen the supervisory powers of the Bangsamoro government through the MILG and provide clear guidance on the relationship between the Bangsamoro government and its constituent LGUs.

Through this proposed Code, it is expected that the Bangsamoro government will develop a more responsive and accountable local governments in the region.

#### Implementation of the Mandanas-Garcia ruling poses opportunities and challenges

The implementation of the Mandanas-Garcia ruling in BARMM will equip LGUs with more resources to implement its devolved functions. However, the implementation should be accompanied with a range of capacity development support in terms of the structure, policies, skills, mechanisms, and systems and processes.

#### Strong support of national government and international development partners

The BARMM is strongly supported by the national government and international development partners in its efforts for institutionalization and socioeconomic development. Their assistance has significant contribution in BARMM's efforts toward a peaceful transition.

The national government has been a major player in the process of achieving long-term peace in the BARMM. Peace dividends have been sustained due to the joint efforts of the GPH and the MILF. The ongoing decommissioning of MILF combatants, which is one of the key provisions of the Annex on Normalization of the CAB, is a specific indication of strengthened partnership between the GPH and the MILF.

The development partners have also played an important role as knowledge and resource brokers, allowing the BARMM to bring together relevant stakeholders from the international, national, and local levels to promote sustainable and inclusive peace and development in the Bangsamoro region. The Bangsamoro government was heavily supported by development partners in charting its development direction through their assistance during BARMM's delicate transition. Also, the development partners have contributed in the region's response and recovery efforts to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Economic

### Trends

#### Second fastest-growing economy in the country

The ARMM experienced the highest economic growth in 2017, registered at 10.1 percent. However, the region's economic performance decelerated in 2018 and 2019 at 7.7 percent and 5.8 percent, respectively. Though the economy of ARMM was growing, the region had the lowest contribution to the overall economic output of the country due to the nature of its economic base, being a producer of raw materials.

According to the PSA, the economy of the BARMM decelerated from a positive rate in 2019 of 5.8 percent to -1.9 percent in 2020. However, the regional economy strongly recovered in 2021, registering a 7.5 percent increase, the second highest growth rate in the country. The region's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate was mainly fueled by AFF at 8.3 percent, industry at 7.9 percent, and services at 6.6 percent.

However, it should be noted that BARMM, which is still in transition, continues to make minimal economic contribution despite its positive economic development. The region's share of the national economy averaged at 1.0 percent between 2010 and 2018, making it the smallest region's share of the country's overall economic performance.

#### Bigger role of industry and services

Over the last two decades, structural changes have been observed. In 2021, the services sector replaced AFF as the leading sector, accounting for 36.40 percent of the region's overall economic output. The industry sector has also seen a dramatic rise from 8.13 percent in 2000 to 24.70 percent in 2021.

However, this does not mean that the AFF has weakened in recent years. AFF remains to be one of the most important sub-sectors in the economic sector. It played a major role in the economic resiliency of the region at the time of the pandemic. It remains to be the main source of food, employment, and income of most of the Bangsamoro households. This only indicates that the region is heading towards a balanced economy. Industry and services are now playing a bigger role and contribute significantly to the region's economic output.

#### Idle land assets and untapped tourism and investment potentials

BARMM sees numerous opportunities to revitalize the region's economy, owing to its abundant natural resources and diverse rural topography, which includes vast tracts of fertile land and marine resources. BARMM is also endowed with natural landscapes and environment, beaches, historical landmarks, and sceneries comparable to known tourist destinations in the Philippines. It has a wide range of flora and fauna, pristine white sandy-beaches, crystalline spring water and towering waterfalls, and a variety of tourist attractions.

Due to this competitive advantage, the Bangsamoro region is viewed as a viable source for producing goods or services at a lower opportunity cost than its trading counterparts. A growing tourism industry is also emerging in BARMM. The Bangsamoro government is making unprecedented investments in tourism. The opening of an inter-regional airline route between Cotabato City and Bongao in Tawi-Tawi province marks an important milestone in promoting tourism in the region.

### Prospects

#### Agriculture development to move at a faster rate

The AFF sector is expected to grow at a faster rate as more lands will be opened for agricultural investments and industry players will have better access to technology, market information, and government support.

#### Expanding industry and services sectors

Construction, real estate, trade, tourism, and investment are perceived as the sunrise industries in the region as the gains in the peace process and overall regional stability will boost investors' confidence.

#### Halal industry growing and expanding markets

Halal industry development is viewed as a very promising investment opportunity. The BARMM is a potential market for Halal-compliant products due to its large Muslim population. The region is also geographically well-situated due to its proximity to most major cities in Mindanao, its access to international maritime routes, and its strategic location along the Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) trade corridor.

#### Islamic finance as a component driver of socioeconomic development

The pursuit of an operational and functional Islamic finance system in the Philippines remains as important and urgent. The current financial system, which is still largely fueled by interest-based and conventional transactions and instruments, does not conform to the needs, identity, aspirations, and way of life of the Bangsamoro.

With this, some Bangsamoro and other Muslim Filipinos were not able to participate in the financial system as exemplified by the very low rate of financial inclusion across the region. This means that a vast number of constituents in the BARMM are excluded from accessing useful and affordable financial products and services that are supposed to meet their needs and improve their overall quality of life.

Cognizant of the pressing need to provide an alternative financial system that is responsive to the needs and aspirations of the Bangsamoro, and recognizing the importance of establishing Islamic finance as a component driver of socioeconomic development, the OCM issued Memorandum Circular No. 0012 in 2021 creating a technical working group for Islamic finance in the BARMM. It primarily aims to develop a roadmap for the comprehensive promotion and development of Islamic finance in the region. This was followed by the issuance of Joint Circular dated 26 April 2022 and a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) dated 04 May 2022 between the Bangsamoro government, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMEF), and the Department of Finance on establishing the Shari'ah Supervisory Board in the BARMM.

In creating the enabling environment for the Islamic finance industry, the Bangsamoro government develops the roadmap for the promotion and development of Islamic finance in the region. It offers a workable and grounded framework intended mainly to serve as a guide in designing the region's Islamic finance development and strategic pathways in a manner that supports and fits seamlessly into bigger socioeconomic development trajectories and objectives. It also lays the foundations for the continuing and sustainability-oriented directions for stakeholders, industry, and inter-governmental dialogue, cooperation, and collaboration.

As part of its holistic approach, the roadmap's strategic thrusts are designed for the Islamic financial services providers, consumers and end users, government regulators, and environment enablers. This translates to interventions that will establish and institutionalize Islamic banks, Islamic microfinance, Islamic pawn brokering or "ar-rahnu", Islamic insurance or "takaful", and the Islamic capital market. Moreover, "zakah", "waqf", and "hajj" financing are important complementary industries and services to the overall development of an Islamic finance ecosystem. Cross-cutting strategies will include the development of human capital, and institutional, regulatory, and market environment.

#### Tighter BIMP-EAGA economic integration

The economic integration through the BIMP-EAGA opens up opportunities for trade and investment. Advancing BARMM's integration in the BIMP-EAGA trade window has been regarded as a means of stimulating its development as a strategic player, as well as increasing its economic competitiveness within Mindanao and the BIMP-EAGA region.

In June 2022, the MinDA and the Bangsamoro government through the BPDA inked a Memorandum of Cooperation aimed at fostering stronger partnership and collaboration to scale up efforts towards more robust participation of BARMM in the BIMP-EAGA and other Mindanao development initiatives. This collaboration is also seen as advancing long-term peace and development across Mindanao and BARMM.

To pursue this integration to the BIMP-EAGA, the BARMM and the national government must promote sustainable and competitive cross-border trading and trade investments, increase strategic infrastructure including digital connectivity, develop value chains for priority commodities with high trade and processing potential, mainstream sustainable and climate-resilient resource management, and strengthen partnerships for knowledge exchange and capacity building.

## Social

### Trends

#### Low human development index but gradual improvement in accessing health and education services

BARMM has the lowest human development index (HDI) in the country, particularly on the performance outcomes in the areas of health and education as well as standard of living. The HDI for BARMM was the lowest of all the regions in 2017. BARMM's score on HDI in 2019 was categorized as medium human development, which is also the lowest in the Philippines. The three provinces with the lowest HDI or low human development in the country are all from BARMM namely, Sulu, Maguindanao, and Lanao del Sur.

#### Historic drop in poverty but remains to be the highest in the country

Poverty remains a major challenge in the region. Poverty incidence in the ARMM continues to rise from 55.8 percent in 2012 to 53.7 percent in 2015. Among the regions of the country, ARMM registered the highest poverty incidence at 61.3 percent in 2018. This rate is almost four times the national poverty incidence posted at 16.6 percent in 2018. The three provinces of the ARMM namely, Sulu, Basilan, and Lanao del Sur, were among the poorest provinces in the country in 2018.

BARMM's poverty incidence plummeted to 29.80 percent in 2021 as compared to 54.20 percent in 2018. However, this rate is still high when compared to the national poverty incidence posted at 23.7 percent in 2021.

#### Gains in overall regional peace and security but threats remain a concern

In recent years, the region has seen sporadic violence, particularly in relation to horizontal armed conflicts like clan feuds/"rido" and other forms of violence such as organized crime, and gender-based violence, among others. There is still a threat to the region's peace, public order, and security. Therefore, strategic efforts to prevent and counter violent extremism, formation of private armies, rise in number of crimes, and other types of threat and violence in the region should remain a top priority.

In addition, efforts to build peace should be directed toward addressing the causes and factors that contribute to instability to lessen the likelihood of the occurrence of violent conflict. COVID-19 also came at a critical time in BARMM's transition period, adding another layer of challenges to the Bangsamoro government's peacebuilding efforts.

#### Normalization process has been sluggish

In 2014, the MILF and the GPH reached a peace deal through the signing of the CAB. Normalization is an important component of the peace process as outlined in the CAB. The Annex on Normalization defines normalization as the process by which communities can attain their desired quality of life, including sustainable livelihood and political participation within a peaceful deliberative society.

Little progress has been observed in the implementation of the normalization process and its essential components, including but not limited to the deployment of peacekeeping teams to bolster conflict mitigation efforts, Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC), the decommissioning of MILF combatants, and confidence building measures such as amnesty and pardon and transformation of the six MILF-acknowledged camps into peaceful and productive communities.

There was a relatively positive start to the normalization process, but COVID-19 has significantly slowed it down over the past years. Efforts to reintegrate former combatants have been hindered by the pandemic by limiting the already scarce funding for Normalization and restricting the mobility of implementers, particularly in the implementation of the socioeconomic programs for decommissioned MILF members and their communities.

#### Camp transformation has yet to be realized but will soon get underway

Camp transformation, a critical aspect of Normalization as noted above, has so far remained largely unfulfilled. In spite of this, a funding mechanism has already been established to support the process of normalization, so it will be possible to move forward with the implementation phase in the following months.

The Bangsamoro Normalization Trust Fund (BNTF), which had its official launch in 2021 will finance, coordinate, and oversee the delivery of assistance from international partners and other donors during the implementation of the normalization process. This assistance will primarily be used for development efforts as well as the rehabilitation, reconstruction, and development of Bangsamoro communities, particularly six previously acknowledged MILF Camps (Abubakar, Omar, Badre, Rajamuda, Bushra, and Bilal), as well as vulnerable sectors across BARMM.

#### Recovery in COVID-19 pandemic

BARMM is not immune to the negative repercussions of COVID-19, especially since the pandemic has struck at a critical juncture in the region's transition period. While the region is still reeling from the negative effects of the pandemic, BARMM is also addressing the challenges brought on by the transition period. COVID-19 has posed a direct challenge to the peace and development in the region by straining the Bangsamoro government's peacebuilding efforts, driving up competition for scarce resources in localities with historical tension, and shifting institutional focus away from building inclusive policies during the formative stage of the region's new administrative apparatus.

The BARMM, like the rest of the Philippines, has been developing strategies to recover faster from the COVID-19 pandemic and address the substantial disruptions it caused. As part of the Bangsamoro Response and Recovery Plan (BRRP) on COVID-19 (2020-2022), the Bangsamoro government outlined critical strategies, including how the government will mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, facilitate adaptation to a new normal, and support gradual socioeconomic recovery over the three years.

As stated in the BRRP, the Bangsamoro government will encourage a whole-of-government approach as well as the convergence of efforts in the implementation of priority PPAs such as intensification of health-care services, strengthening social protection mechanisms, improving livelihood support, sustaining the food supply-chain, ensuring continuity of educational opportunities, and improving the region's adaptive capacity to the current crisis, among others.

### Prospects

#### Significant improvements in education and health performance

Access to education and health services is expected to improve significantly due to greater public investments in education and health and improved capacities of the MBHTE, MOH, and LGUs. Improved research capacities, particularly the use of data, will result in the deliberate targeting of unserved and underserved communities.

#### Declining trend in poverty

Two years have passed since COVID-19 swept the globe, but the pandemic is by no means over. COVID-19 is as much a social and economic crisis as it is a health crisis, yet one thing is certain: it has affected all segments of society with the most severe consequences falling on the marginalized and vulnerable. As we have witnessed, COVID-19 has disproportionately affected the poor and vulnerable who have borne the brunt of the damage.

Our government's efforts to combat poverty have been hampered by COVID-19. According to a study conducted by the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), the pandemic would make it more difficult for the Philippines to reduce poverty and return to its pre-pandemic growth path. But despite this setback, the implementation of poverty alleviation programs has continued, and our government has been ensuring that services were delivered to the basic sectors during the pandemic.

In the case of BARMM, poverty reduction is the most important success story in the region. All of the BARMM government's efforts to reduce poverty are starting to bear fruit, despite the challenges that have been brought about by the region's transition, as well as the pandemic's compounded effects. It is remarkable to note that the BARMM has seen a huge decrease in poverty incidence over the last three years, from 54.20 percent in 2018 to 29.8 percent in 2021. Thus, the region recorded the greatest percentage drop among the regions in the Philippines.

In spite of achieving this significant milestone, BARMM still has the highest poverty incidence among the regions in the country. This entails that the region must scale-up its efforts to ensure that anti-poverty programs and interventions are holistic by means of integrating the necessary social protection components especially for those in need.

As BARMM moves forward with programs meant to hasten its socioeconomic recovery and maintain progress in poverty reduction and economic growth, it must mobilize a larger, whole-of-government and whole-of-society effort to ensure long-term economic growth, lasting peace, and sustainable development in the Bangsamoro.

#### Threats of violent extremism and land conflict remain a challenge but with stronger local government response and support

Violent extremism will continue to be a threat as long as the pernicious shadow economies remain significant in selected localities. However, it is expected that there will be local government response and support as a result of continuing institutional strengthening of the LGUs.

Land conflict is expected to continuously persist in the region in the next few years given the lack of enabling laws in terms of land governance. Thus, a stronger government support should be realized to resolve land conflicts.

#### Social protection will be efficiently and adequately delivered to internally displaced and marginalized communities

The continuing improvement of systems in the BARMM MOAs and the LGUs will result in the efficient and adequate provision of social protection to marginalized communities and internally displaced persons, particularly during emergencies. Technology will grow rapidly in the next few years, making it cheaper and more accessible to state actors and organizations for disaster response and recovery.

#### Madaris education will be strengthened and promoted in the BARMM

The importance of Madaris education in BARMM cannot be overstated. It is particularly important in the context of the Bangsamoro, which is a region that is in a country with a non-Muslim majority. Madaris education plays a vital role in preserving the Islamic faith and culture.

The passage of the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act (BAA) No. 18, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Education Code, is hoped to pave way for a Bangsamoro educational system that is relevant and responsive to the needs, ideals, and aspirations of the Bangsamoro people. More importantly, this Code is seen to strengthen the Madaris system.

As more traditional schools/Madrasahs get accredited and, in the process, getting more government support, Madaris education will be a potent pathway for accessing education in the BARMM. Therefore, there is a need for the Bangsamoro government to focus its efforts on adopting a curriculum for Madaris that is relevant and responsive to the needs and context of the Bangsamoro people.

## Technological

### Trends

#### Demand for high-quality digital connectivity

BARMM continues to face digital connectivity challenges, with inadequate information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure being one of the causes. There is a digital divide in terms of ICT access and utilization. Based on the results of the 2019 National ICT Survey, BARMM has the highest percentage of households without digital access and largest percentage of people who are not using computers among the regions in the Philippines recorded at 95.5 percent and 91.5 percent, respectively.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought this issue to the forefront by demonstrating the critical importance of digital connectivity in dealing with a crisis. The pandemic has revealed the realities that underpin our economies; limited internet connectivity means missing out on employment opportunities, education, health care, public services, as well as the power of information and digital transformation. This is particularly glaring in BARMM especially among the underprivileged and marginalized populations who lack access to computers and the internet.

### Prospects

#### Technology as a potent instrument to reduce inequity and address development challenges in BARMM

Technology is projected to be cheaper and more accessible in the next few years. It can be utilized to enhance the capability of BARMM MOAs to respond to disaster-stricken communities in an adequate and timely manner. Provision of social protection will also be rationalized through better targeting in the use of data and technology. A more important advantage of technology is the ability to leverage it to promote transparent and accountable governance.

On the economic empowerment of the poor and vulnerable sectors, technology can be used to aid farmers and fisherfolks to have better access to market information and in promoting resilient farming. With better access to technology, MSMEs can develop more competitive products and promote them more effectively. Players in the industry will also have the opportunity to access international markets and will have better access to innovations through technology.

In order to harness the potential of technology, BARMM must prioritize and increase budgetary support for digital infrastructure, including ICT, as well as research and innovation. Further, it is important to provide equal access to technology throughout BARMM, particularly to the geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas (GIDA).

#### E-Governance for efficient and effective service delivery

The Bangsamoro government focuses on e-governance in order to improve service delivery. As part of its efforts to strengthen local governance in the region, the Bangsamoro government is currently developing an innovative, citizen-centric service delivery system that fosters innovation. This entails enabling citizens to make use of the benefits of digital transformation via the application of technology for greater access to services and information. Hence, efforts have been focused on improving digital connectivity throughout the Bangsamoro region with the aim of bolstering e-governance.

## Legal

### Prospects

#### The passage of the remaining priority codes

The BTA strives to fast track the passage of priority codes that will aid in the overall development of BARMM. The delay in the passage of priority codes and other significant legislations is believed to have impeded the full realization of some development goals of the region. For instance, revenue generation in the region is a major development concern because of the delay in the passage of necessary legislation. Therefore, the BTA must enact the remaining priority codes, such as electoral, local governance, revenue, and indigenous peoples' rights before the end of the extended transition period.

#### Setting a legislative and policy agenda

For the next six years, it will be crucial for BARMM to set a legislative and policy agenda that will shape relevant and responsive policies and programmatic outcomes, both in the medium-term and in the long-term. As an important precursor to setting up this agenda, it would be necessary to ensure meaningful participation of all relevant stakeholders, particularly those from marginalized and disadvantaged communities, to achieve results that are inclusive and holistic. Additionally, the BARMM must ramp up its efforts to leverage research and evidence-based data to set the legislative and policy agenda for the BARMM.

## Environmental

### Trends

#### Climate change and increasing threat of environmental degradation

BARMM is vulnerable to natural disasters and effects of climate change. It has some of the highest risk indicators in the Philippines. BARMM's geographical location makes it vulnerable to natural disasters. Many of the areas in the region are situated in low lying areas and surrounded by water ways. The region's three mainland provinces, namely, the Maguindanao del Sur, Maguindanao del Norte, and Lanao del Sur are more susceptible to disasters like flooding and landslides.

Aside from this, illegal activities like illegal logging and deforestation have also put the region at risk, noting that the region has a total forest cover of 299,839 hectares. Many of the areas in the region have become more exposed to disaster as their protection is taken off due to illegal activities. Further, rapid commercialization and urbanization of many areas in the region has put it more at risk to disasters due to lack of proper planning and conversion of rivers, forest, and agricultural lands to commercial areas.

Climate change has exacerbated the effects of natural disaster. Among the effects of climate change is rising levels of water, rising temperature, and severe weather events. Rising level of water tide has caused frequent sea surge in the island provinces and the increase in water level causes submersion in some areas of the island provinces in the region. Also, the rising temperature has caused severe drought while severe weather events have caused frequent flooding and flood-induced landslides.

The recent onslaught of Typhoon Paeng (Nalgae) has drawn attention to the fact that typhoons and other natural disasters are becoming stronger due to climate change, resulting in more damages and casualties even in regions that are far from the eye of the typhoon, as in the case of BARMM.

### Prospects

#### Taking an all-of-government and all-of-society approach to CCA and DRRM

Taking into account the context of BARMM, which involves a confluence of man-made and natural disasters, an approach encompassing inter/intra-governmental and multi-sectoral integration shall be pursued. The Bangsamoro government shall also continue to leverage on the capacities of the CSOs to reinforce peacebuilding initiatives. Engaging and empowering CSOs is always central to the BARMM government's strategy in laying the groundwork for a peaceful transition.

Therefore, BARMM's disaster risk reduction and management and climate change adaptation (DRRM-CCA) should espouse a whole-of-government and a whole-of-society approach that underpins effective coordination and convergence of efforts among BARMM MOAs, as well as between the national government and the regional government.

#### Better monitoring, regulation, and supervision in managing environmental assets

The presence of enabling policies and the continuing improvement of systems using data, technology and innovation will equip key agencies such as the MENRE and the concerned LGUs to efficiently and effectively monitor and manage the utilization of environmental assets.

#### Strengthening BARMM's capacity to improve community resilience

The Bangsamoro government plays a critical role in the ability of the communities to recover from the ill-effects of climate change and human-induced shocks through prevention and mitigation, disaster preparedness, and improved disaster response, recovery, and rehabilitation. As the Bangsamoro government improves its systems and as communities gain better access to critical information, a manageable loss in time of emergencies is anticipated.

# Chapter 3: Bangsamoro Spatial Strategy

The Bangsamoro Spatial Strategy (BSS) sets the long-term direction for the development in the BARMM. This chapter introduces the BARMM's vast comparative advantages and potentials that determine the functional roles of its provinces, capital city, and special geographic area that will support and sustain economic development in the region. These functional roles shall support the expansion and emergence of new economies that will sustain economic growth and development across the region.

## Introduction

RA 11054 establishes the BARMM which is composed of the provinces of Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi; and the cities of Marawi, Lamitan, and Cotabato. In addition, 63 barangays from the province of North Cotabato, which is referred to as the Special Geographic Area (SGA), are also included in its territory.

With the ratification of RA 11550 through a plebiscite held on September 17, 2022, the province of Maguindanao is now divided into two: Maguindanao del Norte and Maguindanao del Sur.

## BARMM Profile

*   4,944,800 Million Population (Source: PSA Census, 2020)
*   32,953.01 sq.km. Land Area (Source: NAMRIA)
*   6 Provinces
*   3 Cities
*   116 Municipalities
*   2,590 Barangays

BARMM is the largest region in the Philippines in terms of land area with a total of 32,953.01 sq.km. It covers the 10.98 percent of the total land area of the Philippines which is 300,000 sq.km. It is composed of 6 provinces, 3 cities (1 independent component and 2 component cities), 116 municipalities, and 2,590 barangays. The city of Isabela, despite being part of Basilan, is not under the administrative jurisdiction of the region. Likewise, the SGA is also part of the BARMM as a result of the plebiscite conducted to ratify the BOL.

### Table 3.1 BARMM Land Area, 2018

## Regional Spatial Strategy

Agglomeration, Connectivity, and Vulnerability Reduction are the three key spatial strategy principles that are vital in the identification of the overall spatial strategy of the BARMM and basis for the assessment of the region's growth centers and functional roles.

### Agglomeration

Agglomeration in BARMM is mainly demonstrated by the hierarchy of settlements which reflects the pattern or structure of settlements laid down in the region. The spatial arrangement and distribution of existing settlement strata or services was based primarily on population size, function, degree of urbanization, and presence of economic and social services. In essence, the larger the population of a settlement, the larger the scale of activities, therefore, the greater opportunities for division of labor and specialization.

### Table 3.4 Hierarchy of Networks of Settlements

| Level | Role | Indicator Functions | Population |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Regional Growth Center | Major center that provides services to national and international companies. | Presence of international port, airport, commerce | 1,200,000 and above |
| Sub-regional Growth Center | Provide support services that serve beyond local boundaries | Presence of national airport, level 3 hospital, commerce, and national developers | 120,000 - 1,200,000 |
| Provincial center | Provincial services and administration | Presence of tertiary level education, level 2 hospital, commercial banks, commerce residential subdivision, auto repair shop, service forwarders, cable | 50,000 - 120,000 |
| Local center | Rural and agricultural services | Presence of food retail, secondary school, primary health care, bus terminal, lodging inn | 50,000 and below |

The urban centers in the BARMM have been classified as regional centers, sub-regional centers, provincial centers, and local centers.

### Table 3.5 BARMM Existing Network of Settlements

| Hierarchy | City and Municipality |
| :--- | :--- |
| Regional Center | Cotabato City* |
| Sub-regional Center | Marawi City, Lamitan*, Jolo*, Datu Odin Sinsuat*, Bongao*, Buluan* |
| Provincial Center | Parang, Upi, Wao, Malabang, Sultan Kudarat, Indanan, Maimbung, Parang, Siasi, Talipao. |
| Local Center | **Basilan:** Lantawan, Maluso, Sumisip, Tipo-Tipo, Tuburan, Akbar, Al-Barka, Hadji Mohammad Ajul, Ungkaya Pukan, Hadji Muhtamad, Tabuan-Lasa, **Maguindanao:** Ampatuan, Buldon, Datu Paglas, Datu Piang, Shariff Aguak, Matanog, Pagalungan, Kabuntalan, Talayan, South Upi, Barira, General Salipada K. Pendatun, Mamasapano, Pagagawan, Sultan Mastura, Datu Saudi Ampatuan, Datu Abdullah Sangki, Rajah Buayan, Datu Blah T. Sinsuat, Datu Anggal Midtimbang, Mangudadatu, Pandag, Northern Kabuntalan, Datu Hoffer Ampatuan, Shariff Saydona Mustapha. **Sulu:** Kalingalan Caluang, Luuk, Hadji Panglima Tahil, Old Panamao, Pangutaran, Tongkil, Panglima Estino, Lugus, Pandami, Omar. **Tawi-Tawi:** Panglima Sugala, Mapun, Simunul, Sitangkai, South Ubian, Tandubas, Languyan, Sapa-Sapa, Sibutu. **Lanao del Sur:** Balabagan, Balindong, Bayang, Binidayan, Bubong, Ganassi, Lumba-Bayabao, Madalum, Malabang, Marantao, Masiu, Piagapo, Poona Bayabao, Saguiaran, Tamparan, Taraka, Marogong, Maguing |

*Note: Did not meet the population criteria but considered regional and sub-regional centers because of the presence of services, and income class.*

In the existing hierarchy of settlements, Cotabato City serves as BARMM's Regional Center based on presence of services, and income class. Being one of the functional urban centers with high access to basic facilities and services, Cotabato City shall serve as the financial and commercial hub. It connects to and serves as service center for provincial and local centers on major services such as financial, commercial, education, and health services as the current seat of the Bangsamoro government. Hence, it plays a critical role in linking strategic areas and business centers that are critical to trade and investments.

In 2050, there are 25 municipalities that will be elevated to sub-regional centers and 73 municipalities for provincial centers in terms of projected population as reflected in Table 3.6. All other municipalities in the region will play their role as local centers of their respective provinces.

Meanwhile, the proposed sub-regional centers will provide the services for its nearby provincial centers towards the realization of its functional roles as provided in Table 3.6.

### Table 3.6 BARMM Hierarchy of Settlements Based on Population Projection, 2050

| Province | Sub-Regional Center | Provincial Center | Local Center |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Maguindanao del Norte** | Datu Odin Sinsuat, Parang, Sultan Kudarat, Upi | Buldon, Matanog, Kabuntalan, Barira, Sultan Mastura, Datu Blah T. Sinsuat, Northern Kabuntalan | All other areas |
| **Maguindanao del Sur** | Buluan | Ampatuan, Datu Paglas, Talayan, Mangudadatu, Pandag, Guindulungan, Datu Saudi Ampatuan, Datu Abdullah Sangki, Rajah Buayan, Datu Anggal Midtimbang, Datu Hoffer Ampatuan, South Upi, Shariff Saydona Mustapha, Pagagawan, General Salipada K. Pendatun, Mamasapano, Sultan sa Barongis, Shariff Aguak, Datu Piang | All other areas |
| **Lanao del Sur** | Marawi, Wao, Malabang, Lumba-Bayabao | Balindong, Marantao, Piagapo, Saguiaran, Bacolod-Kalawi, Balabagan, Bayang, Binidayan, Bubong, Butig, Ganassi, Kapai, Lumbatan, Madalum, Madamba, Masiu, Tamparan, Taraka, Tugaya, Marogong, Maguing, Kapatagan | All other areas |
| **Basilan** | Hadji Mohammad Ajul, Lamitan | Maluso, Sumisip, Lantawan, Tipo-Tipo, Tuburan, Akbar, Al-Barka, Ungkaya Pukan, Hadji Muhtamad, Tabuan-Lasa | All other areas |
| **Sulu** | Jolo, Patikul, Talipao, Indanan, Kalingan Caluang, Luuk, Maimbang, Old Panamao, Parang, Siasi | Pata, Tapul, Lugus, Pandami, Omar, Pangutaran, Tongkil, Panglima Estino | All other areas |
| **Tawi-Tawi** | Bongao, Sitangkai, Languyan, Mapun, Sapa-Sapa, Sibutu, Simunul | Panglima Sugala, South Ubian, Tandubas | All other areas |

Moreover, Cotabato City will remain as the regional growth center of the region in 2050 with a projected population of 802,958 and being the primary commercial, financial, and industrial center of the region. It shall likewise continue its role in providing basic services, particularly to the incoming and outgoing visitors and investors in the region.

Further, it is also visualized that in 2050, Cotabato City will stimulate the growth of the region, thus developing into Metro Kutawato consisting the municipalities of Parang, Datu Odin Sinsuat, Sultan Kudarat, Sultan Mastura, and Upi. The creation of Metro Kutawato aims to improve the competitiveness of the region's mainland provinces taking into account the key contributions of other nearby municipalities in intensifying the economic development of the region.

As a metropolitan area, it shall be the center of development where government services, trade, finance, logistics, and social services are enhanced and harnessed to its full potential and paved the way for a more competitive region that is connected to other metropolitan cities in Mindanao.

## Overall BARMM Spatial Strategy, Functional Roles, and Growth Centers

The BARMM shall adopt a multi-nodal overall spatial strategy that consists of primary growth centers and secondary growth centers across the region. The six provinces, Cotabato City, and the SGA shall be the development nodes, and the growth centers are the areas from where the development emanates and radiates all over the region.

While there is an equitable support for the development of these areas in the multi-nodal approach, the level of development may vary among the different nodes. The eventual result in the long-term physical development of the eight nodes shall be the Corridor of New Economies (CONE) that is anchored on the functional roles.

Functional roles were determined by assessing the comparative advantages and potentials of the provinces. These functional roles, once developed, shall stimulate the growth the new economies and thereby help boost the region's economy.

### Cotabato City as the regional financial and commercial hub

Cotabato City is the Central Business District (CBD) of BARMM.

## Vulnerability Reduction

Vulnerability reduction is a principle of spatial strategy that includes the security and protection of agglomerated and connected infrastructure against threats from man-made and natural disasters. It considers the climate change projections and threats of hydrometeorological and geologic hazard, and other events including public health emergencies with increasing initiatives on disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation.

### Hydrometeorological Hazards

The BARMM has become more susceptible to climate change and disasters. This is reflected in their high exposure and vulnerability to floods and droughts. Natural disasters have become more frequent and damaging. Therefore, typhoons and droughts caused displacement, loss of livelihood, disruption of agricultural activities, and food insecurity.

Frequent flooding in low-lying areas, especially in Cotabato City, Maguindanao, and Lanao del Sur, is caused by persistent rainfall in the BARMM and Northern Mindanao that affects large numbers of communities in the region. In addition, BARMM is affected by storm surges particularly in Maguindanao, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi.

Recently, the diminishing area of forest cover, rain-induced landslides, and soil erosions are experienced in the provinces of Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Basilan, and Sulu.

### Geological Hazards

There are two trenches that engulf the region causing the occurrence of earthquakes and tsunamis. Epicenters are located around faults and trenches. Sulu Trench is on the west side of the island provinces of the region and the Cotabato Trench is located in the southwestern coast of the mainland area of the region.

### Volcanic Hazards

The region has two dormant stratovolcanoes, namely, Mt. Ragang and Mt. Makaturing. Both are located in the province of Lanao del Sur. The Mt. Ragang is the 7th highest volcano in the country and recorded its last eruption in 1916 while Mt. Makaturing erupted in 1882.

# Chapter 4: Bangsamoro Development Framework 2023-2028

This chapter consists of three sections. The first section presents the Bangsamoro Development Framework, covering the full hierarchy of results and the corresponding strategies. The second section covers the macroeconomic targets, justifications, and key assumptions. The third section discusses how the 2nd BDP satisfies a crucial planning standard - vertical and horizontal alignment.

## Bangsamoro Development Framework 2023-2028

### Vision

Consistent with the national direction, the Plan's sectoral framework is based on the national framework, but with a focus on regional strategies. It also emphasizes the regional vision: "A Bangsamoro that is united, enlightened, self-governing, peaceful, just, morally upright, and progressive."

The Bangsamoro government also envisions a territory devoid of all types of conflict - one that is permanently peaceful and where residents enjoy a sense of security and comfort as well as just, morally upright, and forward-thinking leadership.

Aside from the fact that a vision is typically long-term in character, key elements such as peace, unity, and justice continue to be relevant as a desired state by the end of 2028.

### Mission

In support to the realization of the vision, the Bangsamoro government is determined to accomplish this mission:

"Guided by moral governance and in pursuit of genuine and meaningful autonomy, the Bangsamoro government ensures the necessary conditions for enduring peace and sustained socioeconomic development suitable to the systems of life, needs, and aspirations of its people by providing services to communities, ensuring multi-stakeholder participation, and facilitating appropriate partnership."

Principles of moral governance and genuine and meaningful autonomy remain central for the Bangsamoro government in achieving the twin goals of lasting peace and sustainable socioeconomic development in the region. Further, the value of inclusion through multi-stakeholder participation and effective governance through services to communities remain to be salient features of the Bangsamoro leadership.

### Overall Goal

The framework of this plan is intended to help the Bangsamoro government in taking a systematic approach to help identify, quantify, and justify the strategies that will help attain the objectives of the region.

The overall goal is to have an empowered, cohesive, and progressive Bangsamoro. "Empowered" refers to the improved capacity of the communities as a byproduct of improved access to quality basic social services and widening of economic opportunities, which are caused by a remarkable growth in institution building and service delivery. "Cohesive" aims to have improved relationships between and among the stakeholders in the Bangsamoro as evidenced in reduced incidence of violent conflict and forged partnerships in governance or in broader development work, while "Progressive" aims to attain a sustained ability of the Bangsamoro region to optimize existing and potential resources in addressing the development needs of the communities and in realizing the economic and the human potential of the region.

### Development Goals

The 2nd BDP consists of six (6) development goals, as follows:

**Goal 1: Stable, just, and accountable government**

Development administration assumes a level of stability in the face of external and internal shocks, ensuring continuity of service delivery. It reflects the ability of ministries, government offices, and authorities to carry out their duties effectively and efficiently, even during emergencies and political events such as elections or any changes in power.

A just government means that the government is the primary agent of economic and social justice. It also means that the government will exercise all powers prudently to advance the public interest and the leaders use their powers to ensure inclusive and pervasive growth.

On the other hand, accountable government means that institutions, leaders, and staff are held accountable for the use of government resources and powers. It also means having accountability frameworks, mechanisms, systems, and processes in place to recognize and reward good performance, learn lessons, and avoid or stop bad practices.

**Goal 2: Equitable, competitive, and robust economy**

An equitable economy implies that economic gains are benefitted by all with special consideration for the poor and marginalized. It also implies that remarkable improvements in key inequality indicators such as Gini coefficient, poverty gap, and poverty severity have been observed.

Competitive economy implies that the BARMM economy enjoys comparative and competitive advantage in selected commodities, and these advantages have been optimized through improved local and international market linkages. It also implies the use of technology by key players in the development and promotion of local products. At the macroeconomic level, this implies a sustained double-digit growth in GDP, and that industry and services sectors account a significant share in the overall economy.

Robust economy implies that the Bangsamoro economy exemplifies a sustained growth over the next six years. It also means that the Bangsamoro government's goal and supporting policies strive to diversify and stabilize the economy to increase the number of quality job opportunities and improve access to goods and services.

**Goal 3: Peaceful, safe, and resilient Bangsamoro communities**

The Bangsamoro aims to achieve lasting peace through ensuring security and intensifying peace-building efforts. It also aims to have a safe community for the Bangsamoro by protecting the Bangsamoro people as well as creating communities that able to withstand natural calamities and human-induced disasters.

**Goal 4: Inclusive, responsive, and quality social services**

The Bangsamoro government aims to have quality social services that are inclusive of all sectors regardless of colors, tribes, and political affiliations to ensure that it will leave no one behind. The Bangsamoro government also ensures that services respond to the needs of the people of all kinds and the Bangsamoro as a whole.

**Goal 5: Rich and diverse Bangsamoro culture and identity preserved and recognized**

The Bangsamoro should exercise its powers and authority to maintain and promote its rich, diverse culture and identity. Its recognition and promotion are mandated under the Sec. 24, Art. IX of the BOL as it is the primary cause of the Bangsamoro struggle.

**Goal 6: Strategic, adequate, and climate-resilient infrastructure**

Strategic refers to the type of infrastructure that has broad-based and inclusive effects to the industries and communities. Adequate refers on the ability to meet infrastructure demands of the industries and communities, and climate-resilient refers to the type of infrastructure that can withstand calamities induced by climate change.

### Development Strategies

Development strategies are identified to ensure that development initiatives in the BARMM are geared towards the attainment of the higher-level development goals, thereby contributing to the national priorities.

1. Improve and strengthen governance mechanisms for a stable, just, and accountable Bangsamoro government;
2. Create an enabling environment towards an equitable, competitive, and robust economy;
3. Harness technology and innovations to increase socioeconomic opportunities and improve government services;
4. Improve ecological integrity, resilience of communities, and ensure a healthy and clean environment;
5. Enhance and strengthen the peace, public order, safety, and security and uphold human rights for inclusive, peaceful, progressive, and sustainable development;
6. Ensure inclusive and equitable access to quality services for social justice and human capital development;
7. Mainstream Bangsamoro cultural diversity, beliefs, heritage, and identity; and
8. Scale-up functional, strategic, climate-resilient, and quality infrastructure to support sustainable socioeconomic development in the Bangsamoro.

## Pillars of Moral Governance

Moral Governance is at the centerpiece of BARMM's leadership and governance for 2023-2028. This core value is exemplified in the principles of the following:

1. **Integrity.** In order to avoid being influenced in the execution of their official duties, those in positions of public trust should not bind themselves in any manner, whether financially or otherwise.

2. **Accountability.** Public office holders should be as open and transparent about all decisions and actions they take. They should document their decisions and limit information only when the larger public interest clearly requires it. Public servants must answer to the people and the authority.

3. **Transparency and honesty.** Holders of public offices must declare any private interests related to their public duties and take steps to resolve any conflicts that arise in a way that protects the public interest. All public transactions should be made public.

4. **Sense of patriotism.** Government officials should invest heavily in their way of life, achievements, rich history, and love for country. Also, the reputation and integrity of the place must be maintained and protected.

5. **Striving for excellence.** To achieve excellence, we must uphold the legitimacy of all our actions. The community will benefit whether public servants consider the credibility and transparency of their work. They should strive to deliver the highest quality in everything they do, prioritizing process over results for the good of all.

6. **Cultural understanding and tolerance.** Public officials should gain a better understanding and awareness on the socioeconomics and differences between societies. They should invest heavily in how they are important for these specific provincial elements, adding variety to the entire Bangsamoro.

7. **Unwavering loyalty to God.** Unwavering devotion to God is one characteristic of an effective public servant. As a result, public officials designated as leaders are required to strictly follow the rules and regulations set by authorities.

8. **Justice.** A public servant should serve the public without prejudice. Equity should triumph without regard for oneself, family and members, companions, or social and political alliances.

9. **Inclusivity.** A good public servant fosters an inclusive environment that makes communities more welcoming and freer from discrimination based on religion, ethnicity, or culture. They appreciate the region's identity-building and cultural characteristics.

10. **Objectivity.** Holders of public office should make only merit-based decisions when conducting public business, such as making public appointments, awarding contracts, or recommending individuals for rewards and benefits. Public officials should decide solely in the public interest. They should do nothing to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their families, and others.

11. **Dialogue and meaningful engagement.** Public servants should ask the opinion of the community by making dialogue with them to specify what needs to be addressed and to get meaningful engagement and positive change to benefit both parties.

12. **Balance between practical life and the moral side.** In carrying out government duties, public servants must balance the practical and the moral or ethical values. They must not deviate from the moral aspect of carrying out their duties and responsibilities, especially in the public's interest.

### Target 1: Sustain an annual average growth rate of 8.0 percent to 9.0 percent for six years

The primary target is to have a sustained growth rather than one-time growth and using an annual average growth rate allows an economy to recover from an internal or external shock. As the region with the lowest economic performance at 1.4 percent share of overall economic growth, it cannot achieve the same level of growth as the national average. The growth rate must be higher to be able to catch up with other regions.

One of the assumptions is that there will be no sustained large-scale war in the next six years. Significant headways in the peace process and a sharp decline in incidents of violent conflict will bolster investor confidence, leading to fresh investments in the BARMM. The region will recover from the ill-effects of the pandemic and there will be no large-scale external shock that will require long term lockdowns and economic restrictions. With most sectors and industries still in their infancy, government expenditure is expected to "pump-prime" the economy. In addition, there are no large-scale internal and external shocks that could potentially wipe out initial economic gains with the scale of a pandemic.

### Target 2: GRDP per capita will have an annual average growth rate of 6 percent to 9 percent within six-years

The economic growth rate will largely outpace the population growth rate. GRDP per capita is a good complement to GRDP as it reflects distribution.

There will be a sustained economic growth rate within the range of 8.0 percent to 9.0 percent and annual population growth will be between 2.0 percent to 4.0 percent for the next six years.

### Target 3: Services and industry sectors to register a sustained double-digit real growth, ranging from 10 percent to 12 percent

Growth in the services and industry sectors is instrumental to inclusive and broad-based growth, as these are the sectors that generate jobs, create wealth, and have greater resiliency at the time of natural calamities such as unfavorable weather conditions. AFF remains BARMM's strongest economic sector, but it needs to be complemented with growth in industry and services to create a more balanced, resilient, and equitable economy. A large portion of the new investments coming into the region as BARMM opens its economy will be in the industry and services sectors. Construction, mining and quarrying, wholesale and retail trade, real estate and ownership of dwellings, accommodation, and food service activities are among the sub-sectors that are expected to be bullish that will generate more jobs.

### Target 4: An upward trend in capital formation in the next six years is anticipated as BARMM registers greater stability and predictability in terms of investment climate. By the end of 2028, Gross Capital Formation should account for 18 percent to 20 percent of GRDE or GRDP.

It is capital formation that will cause long-term and sustainable growth in the region. However, it is highly sensitive to the political and social realities in the region. The passage of priority codes, particularly the Investment Code, will put in place a set of rules and procedures - creating a healthy, stable, and predictable investment climate.

Assumptions include priority codes and other important bills that will be enacted during the extension period; and political events (or changes in power) will not cause or lead to overall regional instability.

### Target 5: Inflation rate maintained at 2.0 percent to 4.0 percent

An inflation rate beyond 4.0 percent will already have repercussions on food items and basic necessities. This target can be achieved by improved competition in markets, a reliable supply chain, and improved connectivity between and across markets as a result of large-scale investments in infrastructure.

Among the assumptions are the national government's investments in large-scale public infrastructure in the region, such as airports, ports, national roads, bridges, and telecommunications that will facilitate trade, improve competition, and reduce operational costs; and BARMM and the LGUs will complement this by investing in local roads, public terminals, and other public infrastructures.

### Target 6: Unemployment rate at 3.0 percent to 5.0 percent; and underemployment rate at 4.0 percent to 7.0 percent

An increasing number of investments and the assistance of the development partners in the region that contributes to the economic performance and development will result to a lower unemployment rate.

Underemployment is a more critical feature in BARMM as a large portion of the population depends on AFF for food and income. With services and industry registering significant shares to overall economic performance, underemployment is likely to be reduced and maintained within 4.0 percent to 7.0 percent since underemployment is more of a rural phenomenon.

Services and industry sectors will have a steady growth in the next 3-6 years, reducing the vulnerability of a significant percentage of the labor force to underemployment issues.

### Target 7: Poverty incidence at 20 percent to 25 percent; poverty gap at downward trend, and poverty severity at downward trend

Given the significant reduction in poverty incidence in 2021, the Bangsamoro government can sustain a double-digit drop in poverty incidence of the region. The target is to reduce poverty incidence to a range of 20 percent to 25 percent with poverty gap and poverty severity on a downward trend.

The poverty gap and poverty severity are critical indicators for BARMM as these reflect distribution issues. The poverty gap is critical because it reflects the depth of poverty, while the poverty severity is equally critical because it reflects inequality between and among the poor. Conflict in BARMM is an injustice issue, and inequality between and among the poor is a strong manifestation of economic injustice.

Social protection programs will continue and will be further strengthened through better systems at the regional and local levels. These programs are vital and, in fact, serve as lifelines during emergencies.

## Ensuring Horizontal Alignment

When it comes to horizontal alignment, the Bangsamoro government also ensures that the 2nd BDP is aligned with the Enhanced 12-Point Priority Agenda of the BARMM.

The BDIP translates the 2nd BDP's development thrusts and priorities into concrete programs and projects. The AIP shall be prepared to serve as basis in the preparation of the budget proposals of BARMM MOAs for possible funding through the GAAB.

---

## Ensuring Vertical Alignment

The Bangsamoro government ensures that the strategies were vertically linked to the Mindanao development plans, the 8-Point Socioeconomic Agenda of the Marcos Administration, PDP 2023-2028, Ambisyon Natin 2040, and SDGs.

### Alignment to the Mindanao Development Agenda

The Bangsamoro government ensures that its development strategies were in line with the development agenda of Mindanao in order to create economic opportunities, integration, and growth throughout the entire Mindanao. Through this strategy, the BARMM will be part of future development initiatives in Mindanao as well as in the BIMP-EAGA.

### Alignment to the 8-Point Socioeconomic Agenda of the Marcos Administration

The 2nd BDP is bolstered, outlining its strategies to contribute to the Marcos administration's 8-point socioeconomic strategy to intensify efforts to mitigate the effects of inflation through its overarching objective of reviving job growth and reducing poverty by guiding the economy back to its high-growth course and, more significantly, via economic reform for a wealthy, inclusive, and resilient society.

The 8-Point Socioeconomic Agenda is strategically focused on several economic issues, including minimizing socioeconomic scarring, reducing transportation and logistics costs, enhancing social protections, ensuring sound macroeconomic fundamentals by improving bureaucratic efficiency, increasing employability to create more jobs, improving infrastructure, achieving energy security, and encouraging research, development, and innovation.

In a similar vein, the 2nd BDP's overarching goal is to create an empowered, cohesive, and progressive Bangsamoro. The plan has identified development strategies that will ensure that activities in the BARMM are directed toward achieving higher-level development goals and also supporting national priorities.

### Alignment to the PDP 2023-2028

In achieving the nation's development agenda, the Bangsamoro government collaborates with the national government. The 2nd BDP is a six-year plan that follows the national planning period.

The Bangsamoro government guaranteed that the 2nd BDP is in conformity with the PDP 2023-2028, which is focused on achieving economic transformation for prosperity, inclusivity, and resilience. It is also aligned and supporting the realization of the Ambisyon Natin 2040.

### Alignment to the SDGs

The SDGs provide a practical framework for pinpointing the region's potential contributions and developing a focused action plan for development strategy.

Linking regional development initiatives with the SDGs would significantly contribute in building a better world while addressing the development risks and concerns in the region. The Bangsamoro government could then direct its programs and projects on the pertinent problems, transforming challenges brought on by resource scarcity, population growth, poverty, and environmental issues into real opportunities.

### Table 4.2 Alignment of the 2nd BDP 2023-2028 to the Mindanao Development Agenda, 8-Point Socioeconomic Agenda of the Marcos Administration, PDP 2023-2028, and SDG

# Chapter 5: Improving and Strengthening Governance Mechanisms for Stable, Just, and Accountable Bangsamoro Government

The BOL provides the Bangsamoro government the autonomy to exercise self-governance, powers to promote the general welfare, authority to regulate its constituent LGUs, a mechanism for resolving intergovernmental relations, a justice system in consonance with traditional laws and the Constitution, and the benefit of enjoying fiscal autonomy, among others. Most critically, the BOL designates the BTA as the interim government during the transition.

This chapter describes the Bangsamoro government's overall strategy for handling its development administration or governance sector. It supports the BARMM's enhanced 12-Point Priority Agenda 1 which aims to strengthen the bureaucracy in the region and Agenda 3 which aims to increase revenue generation and economic comparative advantages. It is also consistent with the Marcos Administration's 8-point Socioeconomic Agenda 3 - Enhance Bureaucratic Efficiency and Sound Fiscal Management; aligned with the SDG 16 — Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions; and SDG 17 — Partnerships to Achieve the Goal.

This chapter covers the six sub-sectors of the development administration sector, namely: Bureaucracy, Development Planning, Legislation, Fiscal Management, Multi-Stakeholder Engagement, and the Bangsamoro Justice System.

## Sectoral Assessment

### Sectoral Trends

The development administration as a sector under the BEDC ensures to address developmental, governance and socio-economic changes, issues, and challenges. Symbiotic with public administration, the sector is presumed to be the central part of development. Together with all other sectors, the development administration sector oversees interconnecting policies and directions of the planning, programming, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation of all development programs, projects, and services and alignment to the development initiatives of the national and local governments.

The sector is steered by the DACom and composed of BARMM MOAs mandated with administration and oversight functions.

In the 1st BDP 2020-2022, the development administration sector plays an integral part in the establishment of the BARMM bureaucracy. The establishment of the foundations for an inclusive, transparent, accountable, and efficient governance is the first of the eight BDP development goals that the BARMM government identified as vital for the attainment of the overall goal of uplifting the lives of the Bangsamoro and establishing the foundations of self-governance through moral governance.

## Bureaucracy

**Organizational strengthening gaining momentum, though gaps persist.** The change of political structure provided by BOL creates opportunities for the Bangsamoro to exercise self-governance through a parliamentary form of government. The shift from unitary to parliamentary government system supports stronger executive-legislative working relationships. Further, the merging of agencies allows for systematic and integrated interventions. Thus, issues on previously non-devolved offices were strengthened, thereby addressing government response capacities.

In 2020, 15 ministries were created and fully operationalized upon the enactment of the BAA 13 or the Bangsamoro Administrative Code. Previously, the defunct ARMM had 25 regional departments, and these were restructured during the transition of ARMM to BARMM.

The approved BAA 13 and the 1st BDP 2020-2022 stated that 33 offices would be created in the BARMM. Only 48 percent of the proposed 16 offices in the year 2020 and 55 percent of the proposed 33 offices in the years 2021 and 2022 are fully operationalized.

Since the ratification of the BOL in 2019, the Bangsamoro government utilized the budget of the defunct ARMM and the allocation for the Modified Disbursement System (MDS) and locally funded agencies is applied and operated.

All the fundamentals of institutionalizing the structure of the created offices are still in process. Further, the disparity on the scale describes that the offices created and established during the ARMM period significantly differ from BARMM, which is outlined in a parliamentary form of government.

As part of establishing the bureaucracy, the Bangsamoro government, through the MFBM, has created and authorized 50,467 positions across 15 ministries and 13 executive offices as of November 18, 2022. This includes the absorbed positions of employees from the education, health, and social services sectors. Of this number, 72.55 percent or 35,812 positions are already filled-in as of November 2022.

Meanwhile, 1,078 coterminous positions are also created mostly under the Parliament with 92.67 percent hiring rate. There are also 336 contractual plantilla positions created, but only 17.55 percent are filled-in.

**Mechanism for coordinating regional development efforts fully functional.** The BEDC as the socio-economic planning, monitoring, and coordinating agency for all development policies, plans, programs, and projects of the Bangsamoro government shall evaluate and recommend short-, medium-, and long-term comprehensive development plans, programs, and projects for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region for approval by the Parliament. The development plans, programs, and projects shall take into account the development plans of the provinces, cities, municipalities, and barangays as approved by their respective local development councils.

In 2019, the BEDC was established and tasked to focus on the socio-economic development in the BARMM together with its five committees that will assist the Council in performing its mandate and responsibilities namely: DACom, PPOSSCom, EDCom, SDCom, IDCom. It also has special committees namely: RSCom, RLUC, and RPMECom. In 2021, the Bangsamoro Gender and Development Special Committee (BGADSC) was established as a special committee on GAD.

Article VI of the BOL emphasizes the importance of intergovernmental relations (IGR) between the national government and the Bangsamoro government, specifically for the integration, coordination, and harmonization of policies, and programs.

Even though the priorities of both governments are to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic during its height, six out of eight or 71 percent of the IGR mechanisms in the BOL have already been operationalized. The other two mechanisms are the Philippines Congress - Bangsamoro Parliament Forum (PCBPF) and the Bangsamoro Sustainable Development Board (BSDB).

On November 15, 2022, the first Philippine Congress-Bangsamoro Parliament Forum (PCBPF) was convened marking another milestone in the implementation of BOL. While the BSDB was already passed into law last June 2022.

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the IGRB and other IGR mechanisms continued to fulfill their mandate of resolving IGR issues between the national government and the Bangsamoro government.

**Turnover of Cotabato City to the BARMM: A major IGRB milestone.** The most significant milestone of the IGRB was the turnover of Cotabato City to the BARMM which was eventually took effect through a ceremony on December 15, 2020 at the Shariff Kabunsuan Cultural Complex (SKCC) in the Bangsamoro Government Center (BGC), Cotabato City. This was pursuant to the directive of former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte to complete the turnover in December 2020, a year after the issue was first raised by the Bangsamoro government to the IGRB during its first consultative meeting on December 16, 2019.

The DILG and the MILG spearheaded the turnover, with consultations from the city government of Cotabato and the Bangsamoro government. During the ceremony, national government secretary of the Interior and Local Government Eduardo M. Año signed the documents for the transfer of supervision of Cotabato City to the MILG, as well as the properties, assets, and records of the DILG Cotabato City field office.

Other milestones of the IGRB include salaries of teacher and education sector employees in the SGA and in Cotabato City; Omnibus Request of the Bangsamoro government to the Civil Service Commission (CSC); creation of regional offices of the National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM), Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP), and Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) in the BARMM; establishment of Bangsamoro Electoral Office (BEO); participation of the Bangsamoro government in the national development planning; and transfer of existing natural reserves and protected areas to the Bangsamoro government.

In 2021, 59 percent of the 70 LGUs in BARMM were compliant with the seven elements of LGUs functionality, compared to 50 percent in 2020. However, in 2019, data were not provided due to the transition process.

The island provinces registered a relatively low compliance with LGU functionality due to its geographic disadvantages. The mobility, connectivity, insufficiency of facilities, and the scarcity of construction-imposed materials are among the challenges in terms of the service delivery in the area.

The BARMM has high hopes that it will increase its number of functional LGUs, particularly those in the island provinces. The recent opening of routes such as the Cotabato to Tawi-Tawi flight routes and taking advantage of the Tawi-Tawi as the front door to the BIMP-EAGA will significantly change the status of concerned LGUs in BARMM.

**Transforming governance through Bangsamoro local government incentives and awards.** The BARMM through the MILG evaluates the functionality of LGUs through the following seven elements: presence of a government center with facilities; presence of working elected and appointed mandatory officials and functionaries; functional local special bodies; functional local legislative body; approved mandated plans and budget; availability of basic services; and sound fiscal management.

The Seal of Good Local Governance (SGLG) puts a high premium on integrity and good performance as pillars of meaningful local autonomy and development. Of the total LGUs, 28 were awarded in 2019 compared to the 23 in 2018. The province of Maguindanao got the most awardees, followed by Lanao del Sur. Limited mobility due to COVID-19 pandemic, MILG suspended the awarding of SGLG in 2020 and 2021. In 2022, a total of 14 LGUs were awarded with SGLG including one from Basilan, ten from Maguindanao, two from Lanao del Sur, and Lamitan City.

Despite the few percentages of awardees, the slight increase from 2018 to 2019 was a good indication for the Bangsamoro government's effort in pushing its constituent LGUs to perform. However, progress was impeded due to challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, which triggered the DILG national to suspend the SGLG assessment process in all regions.

Guided by principles and advancing moral governance in the Bangsamoro, the Salamat Excellence Award for Leadership (SEAL) was launched in 2020 inspired by the documentation of life story and leadership principle and practices of Amerul Mujaheedin, and development of excellence award for Local Chief Executives (LCEs) who have demonstrated similar passion for the welfare of Bangsamoro people.

A total of six LCEs in 2020 across the BARMM were awarded for showing exemplary leadership practices in emulating accountable, participatory, and service-oriented leadership which have verifiable impact to the achievement of the four core strategies in running public organizations. The Bangsamoro government continues its efforts in delivering and inspiring more LCEs to gain such awards. To date, a total of seven LCEs have gained the prestigious SEAL award with five finalists in the year 2021.

Since July 25, 2022 to August 26, 2022, the application and nomination for the SEAL has officially opened to all LCEs that are qualified and have met the requirements based on MILG MC No. 125, series of 2022 re: Guidelines in the Implementation of SEAL Program CY 2022.

Barangay Kauran in Ampatuan, Maguindanao, was the first awardee in the BARMM that received the first runner-up for the 4-6th class municipalities category of the Lupong Tagapamayapa Incentives Award (LTIA) for CY 2022 during the national awards ceremony held on November 28, 2022 at The Manila Hotel, Ermita, Manila.

LTIA is a system of providing economic benefits and other incentives to outstanding Lupong Tagapamayapa, the body that comprises the Katarungang Pambarangay or Barangay Justice System, established to settle minor cases involving barangay residents outside of the courts that demonstrate exemplary performance in resolving disputes at the grassroots or barangay level.

On anti-drug campaign efforts for the year 2022, a total of six LGUs hailed as national awardees for the Anti-Drug Abuse Council (ADAC) Performance Audit. The award is in recognition of the exemplary performance in the implementation of all anti-illegal drug programs, projects, and activities of the LGUs.

The search continues with the implementation of the 3rd annual LGU Grant Assistance for Innovative Practices (LGAIP) that aims to highlight LGU innovative practices at the regional level, making it a benchmark for strategies that LGUs may utilize in delivering quality services through innovative means despite the challenges being faced by the local governance. The MILG conducted the final screening process for the shortlisted 10 applicants of the program and was able to identify innovative practices worthy of the award and secure agreement between the winning parties and the ministry. To date, a total of 14 LGUs have been awarded with LGAIP award.

The Search for Model Barangays (SMB) is the newest incentive program of the MILG that aims to recognize barangays with exemplary performance and to serve as fine examples and inspirations on good governance among the 2,590 barangays in the region.

Barangay Rempes in Upi, Maguindanao was declared the first Model Barangay Awardee for CY 2021 and received Php1 million and building marker as incentives. A total of 11 barangays were awarded as Model Barangay for CY 2022.

The shortlisted barangays are also passers of the SGLG for Barangay (SGLGB) and LTIA, garnered IDEAL rating for the Local Government Functionality Appraisal for Barangay (LoGFA-B), and have the HIGH or IDEAL rating of Functionality Audit for the Barangay Based-Institutions as pre-requisite to be eligible to this award.

The LoGFA and Performance Assessment Scorecard System (PASS) are the performance oversight assessment tools that intend to assess the functionality of LGUs in BARMM. These tools aim to assess the LGUs, particularly on the abovementioned seven elements of functionality as implementing tool for the LoGFA. A total of 57 LGUs in 2020, 66 in 2021, and 59 in 2022 with Ideal Functionality were awarded under the LoGFA.

**More LGUs compliant to Seal of Good Financial Housekeeping (SGFH).** In 2019, a total of 89 LGUs in the BARMM were awarded with SGFH, accounting for 75 percent of the total number of LGUs.

Maguindanao provincial office passed the SGFH standards with only a few barangays not fully compliant. Remarkably, in 2021, despite the challenges due to the breakout of COVID-19 in the previous year, which impeded the progress of the program. The province is now completely recognized with a hundred percent SGFH compliant. Followed by the province of Lanao del Sur with 29 LGUs or 74 percent, in 2019 and 22 LGUs or 56 percent, in 2021. Similarly, the majority of the functional LGUs across the Bangsamoro region were awarded with SGFH, which implies a respectable change compared with preceding years.

**More LGUs are compliant to the Full Disclosure Policy (FDP).** The MILG sustained the drive for greater LGU transparency and accountability with 98 LGUs in 2019, 103 in 2020, and 102 in 2021 compliant with FDP.

Pursuant to the mandate of the MILG to assist the Chief Minister in exercising general supervision over the constituent LGUs of BARMM, one of the fundamentals of the regulatory dimensions of such supervision is compliance to government policies. Progress in compliance among LGUs to national and regional policies was demonstrated.

The compliance of LGUs to national and regional policies is regularly monitored using the Performance Audit and Compliance Tracking System (PACTS). From 2020-2021, the number of PACTS passers in the BARMM slightly improved from 33 LGUs to 43 functional LGUs. Among the LGUs, Cotabato City has been consistent and strictly complying with the policy despite the pandemic in 2020.

Under PACTS, the acquiescence of the 10-Policy Areas is regularly monitored in the level of the LGUs, namely: 1) Full Disclosure of Local Budget and Finances, and Bids and Public Offerings, 2) Attendance of Local Chief Executives, 3) Sanggunian Functionality, 4) Attendance of Local Authorities, 5) Implementation of the five percent disaster risk reduction and management fund (DRRMF), 6) Local Special Bodies, 7) Physical Implementation and Utilization of 20 percent Development Fund, 8) Submission of Annual Accomplishment Report, 9) Ecological Solid Waste Management (ESWM), and 10) Provincial Development and Physical Framework Plan (PPDFP)/ Comprehensive Development Plan (CDP).

**Inconsistent trend in terms of compliance to mandated plans.** In terms of PDPFP, the data shows that there is a fluctuating trend of performance in 2021 with only two compliant LGUs or 40 percent in comparison to the 2020 figures where only four provincial offices or 80 percent out of five have complied.

Province of Maguindanao had the highest number of LGUs that submitted comprehensive land use plan (CLUP) from 2020 to 2021. On the other hand, the preparation of CLUP must be prioritized by every LGU, as only 45 LGUs accomplished this in 2021, compared to 50 in 2020.

**Presence of Government Centers with Facilities.** In order for local government centers to be classified as functional, data on presence of government centers with facilities serve as the basis. Increase and decrease in the numbers through the years can be attributed to Bangsamoro Government interventions through Support to Local Moral Governance (SLMG) program, and a more stringent inventory of facilities.

---

## Development Planning

**Regular plans formulated and adopted in the BARMM for the year 2019 to 2022.** The BPDA, as a technical arm of the Bangsamoro government, had formulated three regular plans for the past three years and were adopted by the BEDC. In 2020, the 1st BDP, 2022-2025 was formulated and adopted, while, the Bangsamoro Response and Recovery Plan (BRRP) and the Camp Transformation Plan (CTP) were adopted in the year 2021. The mentioned preceding plans were crafted and aligned to the BARMM 12-point priority agenda in realization of the Bangsamoro government's overall goal of uplifting the lives of the Bangsamoro people through moral governance.

As a key component for achieving moral governance, the Bangsamoro government ensures formulating relevant and responsive plans. The 1st BDP was primarily set to achieve its overall goal of uplifting the lives of the Bangsamoro people through moral governance, and the development planning keeps its tract gearing towards the Philippine long-term vision — Ambisyon Natin 2040. The BRRP was also formulated in response to the COVID-19 outbreak in the region, while the CTP is strongly anchored to the normalization process under the CAB to fulfill the moral obligation of the Bangsamoro.

---

## Legislation

The BTA is mandated to exercise the powers granted to it under Section 5, Article VII of the BOL. One of the functions of the parliament is to enact laws to promote, protect, and ensure the general welfare of the Bangsamoro people and other inhabitants in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

As of 2021, three of the seven priority codes were already enacted. In 2020, out of seven priority codes only the Bangsamoro Administrative Code was signed into law by the Parliament on October 28, 2020. In 2021, two additional codes were signed into law, namely, the Bangsamoro Civil Service Code, which was approved by the Parliament on February 24, 2021, and the Bangsamoro Education Code which was enacted on May 18, 2021. To date, the Members of the Parliament are working on the four remaining priority codes.

A total of 260 out of 748 resolutions or 34.75 percent were approved from 2019 to 2022. A total of 31 out of 184 or 16.84 percent of bills filed were approved by the Parliament from 2019 to 2022.

---

## Fiscal Management

The grant of fiscal autonomy as provided in Section 1, Article XII of RA 11054 paved for an exercise of self-governance not only in policy-setting but also in resource mobilization and expenditure management. Through fiscal autonomy, the Bangsamoro government is given the power to create sources of revenues besides the annual block grant provided by the national government, as well as exercise budget autonomy to ensure that these resources are spent in programmatic, transparent, performance-based, and phased manner.

The annual block grant is consistently the largest source of revenues from 2020 to 2022, accounting almost 90 percent of the total resources. This was followed by the Special Development Fund (SDF) which accounts for about seven percent of total revenues. Local collections registered the lowest contribution, accounting for less than one percent of total revenues.

Among the main causes that explain the erratic movement in the revenue collections of BARMM is the absence of enabling legislation, i.e., the Revenue Code. Its establishment will have a high impact on those agencies with collecting authority by further improving the management and mechanisms of imposition of the required tax, fees, and charges within the power conferred by the BOL. Thus, its effect is direct to local revenue collections which will improve tax revenues (i.e., regional wealth tax, contractors' tax, travel tax), regional fees and charges, and other revenues.

Furthermore, external factors also affect the increase/decrease of the revenue sources of BARMM as these are already provided in RA 11054.

First, the amount of the block grant shall be equivalent to five percent of the net national internal revenue tax collection of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and the net collection of the Bureau of Customs (BOC) from the third fiscal year immediately preceding the current fiscal year. Necessarily, the amount of annual block grants is directly dependent on the collections made by the national government. For instance, as an effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, which resulted in the dramatic decrease of the Philippine economy, hints at a lower revenue collection by the national government.

Second, the national government shall provide SDF to the Bangsamoro government for the rebuilding, rehabilitation, and development of its conflict-affected communities. The amount equivalent to Fifty Billion pesos (Php50,000,000,000.00), at five billion pesos (Php5,000,000,000.00) per year, for a period of 10 years from the ratification of the BOL, shall be allocated for this purpose.

Lastly, the share of the Bangsamoro government in the taxes collected by the national government is 75 percent inclusive of the shares of the constituent LGUs.

### Actual Expenditures

As a new government conferred with fiscal autonomy, the Bangsamoro government is placed in a strategic position which enables it to manage expenditures based on development interventions that truly responds to the peculiar needs of the region. What comes with this opportunity is the immense responsibility of the regional government to ensure that the spending of resources is not only aligned with the development direction of the region but also the management of expenditure is compliant with the generally accepted principles in budgeting as set by the national government.

For the past three fiscal years, the total revenue is utilized for the following: a) Regular Funds—funds appropriated for the regular operations of the ministries and offices; b) Special Development Funds—funds appropriated for special development projects based on the provision of the BOL; and c) Special Purpose Funds—funds which are appropriated for special programs or expenditures which may be performed or implemented by a ministry or office but are not lodged in their regular funds.

Of the total annual budget, the regular fund allocation can be seen to be on an increasing trend based on the 2020 data. This increase can be attributed to the improvement in the identification of regular functions of the implementing institutions due to the enactment of the BAA 13. On the other hand, the decrease in the Special Purpose Fund (SPF) is due to the minimal expenditures not considered to be part of the regular funds of the ministries and offices; this includes the Miscellaneous Personnel Benefit Fund (MPBF), the contingent fund, and the shares of the LGUs in the taxes, fees, and other charges collected by the national government within BARMM.

The appropriation based on the block grant and other sources commenced in year 2020 as the BTA Parliament enacted its first BAA 03 amounting to sixty-five billion nine hundred sixteen million four hundred sixty-seven thousand, six hundred eighty-six pesos and forty-six centavos (Php65,916,467,686.46) of which there is a 75 percent fund support rate as evidenced by allotment releases to the different ministries and offices.

Moreover, the second General Appropriations Act of the Bangsamoro (GAAB) enacted in 2021 appropriated an amount of seventy-five billion six hundred twenty-eight million six hundred eighty-one thousand seven hundred forty-eight pesos and twenty-six centavos (Php75,628,681,748.26), 84 percent of which were released to ministries and offices for their development interventions. Meanwhile, 52.57 percent or forty-two billion one hundred twenty-nine million two hundred forty-seven thousand three hundred thirty-six pesos and thirty-three centavos (Php42,129,247,336.33) of the appropriated funds were already released to the different ministries and offices as of October 31, 2022.

### Fund Utilization

For FY 2020, the Bangsamoro government incurred a 79.23 percent utilization rate for its BARMM MOA Regular Fund amounting to Php34,212,492,621.85 (Table 5.1). Out of this fund, 67.40 percent or Php13,567,088,578.93 was utilized for Personnel Services (PS), 95.62 percent or Php12,448,656,243.90 for Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE), and 81.69 percent or Php8,196,747,799.02 for the Capital Outlay (CO).

While the region is in its early inception, it is the priority of the Bangsamoro government to track its accomplishments and monitor its spending to ensure that the government interventions are provided in an effective, efficient, and responsive manner. Hence, the BARMM, through the joint effort of the OCM, MFBM, and the BPDA conducted a periodic assessment of the physical and financial performance of the BARMM MOAs.

### Revenue Collection

In 2019, the policy direction which the MFBM-BTO worked on was consistent with the moral governance program of the Chief Minister Ahod B. Ebrahim. Several trainings were conducted or participated by the employees of the MFBM-BTO on matters relating to treasury mechanisms, good practices, and application of moral governance to treasury practices for the purpose of increasing accountability on safe-keeping of BARMM funds. For the last quarter of FY 2019, operations have been stable and local funding requirements of BTA, and BARMM MOAs by virtue of the FY 2019 regional appropriations has been fully served.

The regional collections for FY 2019 amounted to Php394,709,755.62. The target for the period was Php248,615,000.00. Actual regional collection surpassed the target by Php146,094,755.62 or over 59 percent. Moreover, collection increased by 62.05 percent compared to the FY 2018 collection of Php243,568,364.68.

It was crucial for the MFBM-BTO to be prepared to receive the annual block grant starting CY 2020. The office ensured that the Authorized Depository Bank of the Bangsamoro has been opened in early January. The ARMM employees who were extended served as the accountable officers so there have been continuous treasury operations. The MFBM-BTO maintained a single account for all the funds received including local revenue collections. The MFBM-BTO was able to manage and safeguard revenues from the annual block grant, share from the national taxes, regional taxes, fees and charges, special development fund, and other subsidies from national government.

### Local Revenue Collection Performance

In 2019, local revenue collection surpassed the target by 59 percent. This collection is the highest collection reached by the Bangsamoro government. In 2020, even during the pandemic, the local revenue collection surpassed the target by 34 percent. Although the collection was greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the implementation of infrastructure projects and continuing increase in the collection of fees and charges particularly from the Bangsamoro regulatory offices have ensured the achievement of the target. Moreover, the remittance of the proceeds from the PAGIBIG financing of the housing project also contributed to the collection performance.

## Multi-stakeholder Engagement

Pursuant to Section 5 of BAA 06, the Council shall include all provincial governors of Tawi-Tawi, Basilan, Sulu, Maguindanao, and Lanao del Sur and all city mayors of Cotabato, Marawi, and Lamitan of the BARMM.

The participation of LGUs will ensure that the approved development plans of the provinces, cities, municipalities, and barangays are incorporated into the BDP. It also ensures its effectiveness and responsiveness to the needs of the Bangsamoro.

The Bangsamoro Parliament enacted BAA 06, establishing the BEDC, in accordance with the provisions of RA 11054. The act calls for the BEDC to include five Private Sector Representatives (PSRs) as regular members.

Section 5 of the BAA 06 states that the BEDC will select the five PSRs based on the drafted guidelines and qualification criteria developed by the BPDA and approved by the Council to ensure objectivity, integrity, and transparency. It also contains the accreditation and selection procedures, criteria, and the required qualifications of the nominating private sector organizations (PSOs) and PSR nominees. The purpose of the accreditation is to provide eligibility for the PSOs to nominate one of its members as a PSR member of the Council.

Concerning the socioeconomic development of BARMM, the BEDC has accredited CSOs working in BARMM in pursuit of public interests. In 2020, there have been 15 CSOs accredited by the Council, another 13 in 2021, and four in 2022. The first set of PSRs was nominated and accredited on December 29, 2020.

## Bangsamoro Justice System

The BARMM has its own regional judicial system that applies Shari'ah to its constituents. The BOL contains a provision to create a Shari'ah High Court. This Court will consist of five justices including a presiding justice and task to oversee the appellate courts, district courts, and circuit courts.

Aside from the Shari'ah High Court, the Shari'ah Public Assistance Office, and Bangsamoro Integrated Bar shall also be established.

To date, the Shari'ah High Court, Shari'ah Public Assistance Office, and Bangsamoro Integrated Bar are not yet established due to inadequate infrastructure facilities and the need to meet the required competencies and qualifications of Shari'ah Judges and personnel. The requirement for the office structure and personnel component of the Shari'ah High Court is crucial for the establishment of the BJS. The office structure and staffing will be patterned from the Court of Appeals (CA) justices.

In support to this, the Parliament proposed a resolution requesting the Supreme Court of the Philippines to facilitate the immediate organization of the Shari'ah High Court in the BARMM to uphold the spirit of the Shari'ah Justice System in the region.

As of 2019, the Judicial and Bar Council (JBC) has created 48 Shari'ah Circuit Courts (SCC) under the jurisdiction of the Shari'ah District Courts (SDC) in the BARMM. While only 33 of the SCC are organized and 15 are not yet organized located in Tawi-Tawi and Basilan.

It is stated in RA 11054 under section 17 that, "the Parliament shall enact laws to promote and support the traditional or tribal justice systems that are appropriate for the indigenous peoples. The traditional justice systems are the mechanisms to determine, settle, and decide controversies and enforce decisions involving disputes between members of the indigenous peoples concerned in accordance with the customary laws of these communities."

While, Section 20 under the same law provides that the Bangsamoro government shall adopt the principles of conciliation and mediation in settling disputes, with the Parliament enacting the necessary legislation to institute the mechanism for alternative dispute resolution. The Shari'ah courts and traditional or tribal adjudicatory tribunals may utilize this mode of settlement and resolution of cases.

## Development Opportunities

The following are the opportunities significant to the development administration:

**Innovation and technology as tools to facilitate good governance.** The COVID-19 pandemic has made it more difficult for people to physically gather, move around, and go about their everyday lives. Work from home, social distancing policies, and even partial or total lockdowns have been established by numerous governmental and commercial organizations or corporations.

In the area of information and communication technology, rapid advancements are already being made, and they are now widely employed to improve ease and effectiveness in many facets of daily life, including the government. Through innovation and technology, the government was able to sustain its operations by redefining its strategies and making them more creative by conducting meetings and transactions online.

This only proves that the role of technology in governance and the delivery of public services is becoming more crucial. Innovation makes progress inevitable, and technology acts as the driving force behind a government that is capable of operating on a global scale.

Hence, it is worth investing for the Bangsamoro government to take advantage of technological innovations as this help raise performance and productivity. More importantly, it makes a significant contribution to increasing accountability, transparency, information, public participation, and support for best governance practices.

On digital transparency of governance processes and bureaucracy, the launch of digital governance system strengthened through establishment of physical ICT infrastructure and systems will allow for direct and real time e-governance access of LGUs through programs such as DevLIVE+ and Localizing e-Governance for Accelerated Provision of Services (LEAPS) program. Piloted in the areas of Butig and Piagapo in Lanao del Sur with technical support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Bangsamoro team benchmarked the Access to Information (A2i) program of the Government of Bangladesh. The e-governance platform program is aimed at integrating government systems into digital service providers maximizing strong partnership with development partners and institutions.

The LEAPS project will help overcome the dependencies on archaic, paper-based, and manual processes within and among the BARMM LGUs. This project will also maximize the use of MILG's limited manpower and resources to deliver and monitor frontline services effectively and efficiently.

The DevLIVE+ generates socio-demographic profiles, not only at the municipal or barangay level but up to the household level. It also provides disaggregated data by sex, age, work, educational attainment, or spatial location through charts, lists, or even map locations that would facilitate analysis in crafting the local land use and development plans. Considering that significant socioeconomic indicators can be captured related to access to basic services among others, local decision-makers have found the tool essential in resource allocation, prioritization of barangays and delivery of services, or justify their programs, projects, and activities using the DevLIVE+ to improve the conditions of communities who are either most vulnerable, left behind, or lacking in access to government services.

To date, three Digital Service Design Lab (DSDL) workshops have already been conducted; 24 e-Services are simplified for digitalization; 24 Technical Assessment has been conducted for digital center and interactive call center; eight LGUs are already on-board for the DevLIVE+ implementation; two connectivities have already been installed; and one GPS/ICT Equipment have already been procured.

**Strong support and linkages with development partners, national agencies, and other stakeholders.** The Bangsamoro government is already receiving extensive help from development partners, national agencies, and other stakeholders. This support goes beyond local economic growth and development. They also help to address problems and difficulties the administration is facing as BARMM embarks through the extended transition.

An intensified partnership with donors and partners helps the Bangsamoro government achieve its development goal effectively and efficiently.

**3-year extension of the transition.** The BTA will continue to act as the interim administration for the BARMM under the terms of RA 11593, which also extends the transition period from May 2023 to May 2025.

This is an opportunity to review, evaluate, and update the BARMM government's current commitments as reflected in the administration's 12-point priority agenda and the region's 1st BDP in order to make sure that the strategic directions remain pertinent and responsive to the region's long-standing and new development challenges.

**Implementation of Mandanas-Garcia Ruling.** The Mandanas-Garcia Ruling ultimately broadened the national government revenue based on the computation of the annual intergovernmental fiscal transfers of LGUs; before it was estimated only on BIR collections but now it also includes the BOC collections.

## Priority Challenges to be Addressed within 2023-2028

### Bureaucracy

The following are the key challenges of bureaucracy to be addressed in 2023-2028:

**Overlapping and unclear functions in the delivery of services between and among different levels of the government.** Bangsamoro government in its transitional period faces different challenges in addressing the needs of its constituents. The ambiguous delineation of functions among national, regional, and local governments has been realized as one of the root causes of this problem. There are other ministries and offices that have the same beneficiaries for a certain program which resulted in duplication of deliverables due to the unclear distinction of their mandates. There is also an absence of a devolution policy from the national government to BARMM and BARMM to LGUs, and a slow phasing of IGRB concerns due to the multiplicity of priorities of the regional government that affect the full functionalities of other offices both in regional and local level.

**Weak inter-BARMM MOAs/LGUs coordination and linkages.** Lack of policies to enforce a strong link between BARMM MOAs and LGUs to strengthen collaboration in identifying problems and challenges on the ground and harmonizing programs to address the gaps.

Poor coordination among offices leads to poor appreciation of convergence and cooperation among offices' programs, projects, and activities that results in duplicity and unbalanced distribution of focus and prioritization.

**Mechanisms for administration and supervision of local governments not fully streamlined at the local level.** Inadequacy of regional policies in the implementation of transparency and accountability agenda and lack of awareness on existing national government policies are hindering factors to fully localized the programs.

**Intergovernmental relations mechanisms not fully established.** With the passage and ratification of the BOL and the establishment of the BARMM, the national and Bangsamoro governments realized the urgency to create an avenue that will further strengthen the relationship between both governments. Hence, On October 14, 2019, then President Rodrigo Roa Duterte approved the recommendation of the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process (OPAPP) to establish the IGRB through a memorandum issued by the Office of the Executive Secretary.

The IGRB is mandated to coordinate and resolve issues on IGR through regular consultation and continuing negotiations in a non-adversarial manner. It shall exhaust all means to resolve issues brought before it. Unresolved issues shall be elevated to the president, through the Chief Minister of the Bangsamoro government.

As of 2022, only five out of seven IGR mechanisms in the BOL have been operationalized including the Council of Leaders which began convening since January 18, 2021. The PCBPF is yet to be constituted on the side of the Philippine Congress and is to be operationalized while the bill creating the BSDB is pending in the Bangsamoro Parliament.

The national government remains steadfast in its commitment to support the BTA in fulfilling its mandate and functions within the extended transition period to 2025. The testament to this is the various intergovernmental relations bodies, most of which have already been organized. To this end, the creation of the remaining IGR mechanisms needs to be fast-tracked in order to institutionalize all avenues for greater intergovernmental cooperation.

**Nepotism and lack of political will.** One of the contributing factors of poor performance among officials and employees is the practice of nepotism or lack of political will. Those who have strong connections with the influenced individuals are accommodated to the positions regardless of their educational backgrounds, expertise, and experiences. Lack of commitment in the performance of one's duty greatly affects the service delivery to the public. Political dynamics in the process of recruitment is a hindrance in the provision of quality services.

### Development Planning

The following are the key challenges of development planning to be addressed in 2023-2028:

**Weak operationalization of planning and budgeting policies.** The absence of a harmonized regional plan and budget resulted in poor implementation of the PPAs. This poor harmonization can be attributed to limited technical know-how and expertise on planning and budgeting.

**Weak data and communications management.** The manual process and unsystematized data collection and management affects the formulation of development plan. The underlying factors aggravating the weak data and communication management include inadequate regional statistical system, insufficient evidence-based data, absence of development communication plan among BARMM MOAs, weak process of data reconciliation between the national, regional, and local levels, and absence of standardized IEC materials.

Outdated records management systems, inconvenient documents repository otherwise known as records center and regional library are also a challenge given that managing official records is a crucial part in the office operations that involves administrative, financial, and legal. Official public documents such as temporary and permanent in nature are necessary to be properly protected and preserved, as documentary evidence in any official transaction. Record is also a contributory factor to help settle the dispute and a basis of decision-making.

**Poor or non-implementation of some priority PPAs in the development plans.** Political interference and non-provision of standardized transition and strategic plan when leadership change hinders the implementation of the existing development plan to support the continuity of the identified program for implementation.

**Non-institutionalization of Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system.** The unavailability of standardized M&E system in the region prevents the generation of credible information through data collection by actual field monitoring. It is noteworthy that the monitoring activity can check the overall status and condition of the PPAs based on investment program while evaluation determines and measures the progress of its implementation and analyzes the effectivity and efficiency of the program. On the other hand, M&E also help find the emerging gaps and issues that impede its implementation.

It has been observed that slow development of the centralized database management system is driven by delayed provision of policy guidelines on the BARMM standardized M&E system. To expedite the process, while the BARMM M&E system is in the development phase, the adoption of the existing National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Regional Project Monitoring and Evaluation System (RPMES) is recommended to serve as guiding tool in the operationalization of the M&E in the BARMM.

In the development of guidelines on BARMM M&E system's operations manual, a strong support by the BEDC to its adoption and approval is imperative for the full-blown operation of the latter. Dedication and collaborative efforts of the BARMM MOAs and the capacity building that includes orientation, trainings, and benchmarking activities are essential as main catalysts that will greatly contribute to the creation of a functional technical working group in the desk and actual M&E activity.

Nonetheless, there is a need to invite M&E experts, specialists, or consultants from the national government to help develop the human resource capacity of both administrative and technical concerns of the M&E system, given the increasing and multiple development projects being implemented in the BARMM.

### Legislation

The following are the key challenges in terms of legislation to be addressed in 2023-2028:

**Slow enactment of some priority codes and other legislative measures.** The BARMM is currently adopting a parliamentary form of government which necessitates setting up a new bureaucracy under a parliamentary structure. The establishment of a strong organizational structure and necessary systems and processes will ensure the delivery of responsive, effective, and efficient services.

The COVID-19 pandemic has hampered the operations of the Bangsamoro Parliament. At the height of the pandemic, the Bangsamoro Parliament passed a resolution to ensure continuity in the conduct of plenary sessions, consultations, and meetings via teleconferencing. However, activities related to the enactment of priority codes and other legislative measures were still affected.

**Inadequate BTA human and physical resources.** Human and physical resources are vital in the success of one's organization as it serve as the driving factor in fulfilling its mandates. However, the Bangsamoro Parliament has inadequate human and physical resources due to weak implementation of hiring plan and merit-based selection process, political interventions, self-interest of political leaders, and inadequate infrastructure and technological support.

**Inadequate research and development in policy-making.** In policy-making, research and development (R&D) must always be considered due to its significance. The timely enactment of laws and policies is hampered by less prioritization on the importance of R&D and limited staff with competent legislative research skills.

**Inadequate exercise of oversight function.** The role of the oversight function is crucial to good governance and needs to be strengthened through appropriate parliamentary systems and procedures. With this, the Bangsamoro Parliament can ensure a balance of power and assert its role as the defender of people's interests. The Members of the Parliament (MPs) hold annual technical budget hearings in every ministry to ensure financial accountability. After the ministries' budget has been passed, the Bangsamoro Parliament has an important role to play in monitoring how the budget funds are spent. However, the Bangsamoro Parliament has an inadequate exercise of its oversight function because there is a lack of monitoring mechanism as to how the budget is being utilized.

**Slow Committee process.** Committees are the principal forum for the discussion and deliberation of policies and conduct of oversight activities. Having a strong committee system is an important determinant of the effectiveness of a Bangsamoro Parliament in implementing its powers. In order for the MPs to effectively perform their duties, the Bangsamoro Parliament must be able to provide them with support and information they need. However, slow committee processes occur due to weak implementation of committee system, limited technical expertise, competing schedules for the conduct of committee activities and public consultations on policy, and absence of internal rules and regulations for some committees.

### Fiscal Management

The following are the key challenges of fiscal management to be addressed in 2023-2028:

As it envisions a strong foundation of inclusive, transparent, accountable, and efficient governance founded on the idealism of moral governance, the BARMM takes on the responsibility to promote honest, efficient, and responsible fiscal management and fund utilization. While in a transition period, the government herald towards strengthening the foundations of sound fiscal policies, responsive budget process, and accountable safekeeping of Bangsamoro resources.

For its first three years of operations, the Bangsamoro government, through its interim ministries committed to fortify the standards and policies which are carefully and judiciously crafted in the context of Bangsamoro experience. The extension of the transition period is seen to be an opportunity for the BARMM to set a clear path and steer the government towards recovery and sustainability for the years to come.

Amidst these initiatives, the government still acknowledges its rudimentary experience in public financial management. For the past two fiscal years, the executive part of the government has experienced the challenge of achieving and maintaining satisfactory budget utilization rates. This may be primarily attributed to the continuing study to improve the efficient strategies in expenditure management. This core problem is brought about by some essential factors such as planning, implementation mechanisms, and procedures involved in fiscal management.

**Limited technical know-how in program budgeting.** One of the seen challenges in the implementation and fund utilization for the first three years of BARMM operation is the limited technical know-how in program budgeting. The BARMM adopts the national policy of cash-based budgeting, limiting the coverage of obligation to one fiscal year only, which enjoins government institutions to be more proactive in their expenditures through optimized planning and ensuring of implementation readiness of programs and projects. Understandably, the BARMM MOAs are only starting to build the foundation of its respective organization. Nevertheless, impactful results and service delivery may only be achieved through improvement in the efficiency in program budgeting.

**Manual budget processing.** Due to the advancement of technology, manual budget processing has been a problem in different organizations nowadays. Limited IT infrastructure, no new government accounting system (e-NGAs), budget and treasury management system (BTMS), unified reporting system (URS), and lack of IT experts on automated budget processing are some of its roots.

There is yet an established system for government accounting or cash management which may have some effect in the delayed implementation of programs and projects. This problem, however, is multi-faceted as it can be attributed to the lack of an efficient IT infrastructure, low connectivity, and expertise in terms of system development. Most notably, the lack of catch-up plan and insufficient capacity of program implementers in the face of natural and man-made calamities contribute greatly to the low absorptive capacity and flexibility of the implementing BARMM MOAs.

**Lack of fiscal and monetary policy.** Policies are relevant to organizations as it guides its operation. However, lack of fiscal and monetary policy has been a problem in the region as up until now there is no revenue and investment code, this might be due to lack of expert adept at BARMM context, lack of prioritization, and lack of an appropriate mechanism that would enable LGUs to generate locally sourced revenue.

Lack of expertise and awareness of Islamic finance is also a factor that can be attributed to the lack of intervention to promote financial literacy (on financial and monetary policies), poor information dissemination on financial literacy and inclusion, and less local public investment.

**Fluctuating rates in local revenue generation.** Although the collections for regional fees and charges have continuously increased in 2021, the collection in regional wealth tax and contractors has decreased, thus making the collection performance short by five percent. The restrictions from the COVID-19 pandemic affected the procurement of infrastructure projects, thus, what was disbursed during the year was mainly from the mobilization fees and some contracts have not been awarded. Thus, the collection of contractors' taxes was not maximized. The collection of regional wealth tax on the other hand is dependent on the production of mines. This type of collection is not stable due to the varying amount of mining production.

**Weak planning, programming, and budgeting linkages.** There is seemingly fragmented planning, programming, and budgeting linkages. This is manifested through the lack of mechanisms like a joint committee or body composed of the planning and financial offices, absence of long-term strategic plans, and limited convergence interventions. This is further weakened by the fast turnover of employees and slow hiring process. Another is the limited technical budgeting capacity due to changes in financial practitioners.

**Delayed implementation of PPAs.** There are several factors that hinder the timely implementation of PPAs which include unpreparedness for internal and external adversities due to lack of catch-up plan, overlapping of implementation schedule of several PPAs, limited technical capacity on program implementation, inadequate staffing and weak structure, and slow hiring process.

Improving the cash management is another concern caused by lack of an automatic reversion system (treasury). The MDS used by the national government in disbursement of funds is a good government practice that is yet to be exercised in the BARMM. Moreover, exploratory talks have been kickstarted with the government servicing bank which is aimed at improving the cash management of the region.

Lastly, the delayed submission of reportorial documents also contributes to the disparity in actual expenditure and monitoring records. The regional government is expected to consolidate reportorial requirements to streamline financial data needed for the presentation of a credible financial position.

### Multi-stakeholder Engagement

The following are the key challenges of multi-stakeholder engagement to be addressed in 2023-2028:

**Differences in approaches and strategies in governance of the political leaders.** There have been these differences in approaches and strategies in governance of leaders because of their differences in political creed and affiliation.

**Poor inclusivity and access to information.** It is being observed that the whole-of-society approach is not adopted due to lack of policy on Rules of Engagement and non-recognition of the expertise of non-state actors. There is also limited public access to information on government processes due to poor implementation of freedom of information (FOI).

### Bangsamoro Justice System

Strengthening the multi-justice system in the BARMM is crucial to ensure inclusive coverage among the diverse communities in the region. The BARMM is composed of a culturally diverse population which requires the Bangsamoro government to implement an inclusive justice system.

Under RA 11054, "The Parliament shall adopt measures to ensure mutual respect and protection of the distinct beliefs, customs, and traditions of the Bangsamoro people and the other inhabitants in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region." The BOL guarantees the protection of the rights of the people in the region.

The following are the key challenges of the BJS to be addressed in 2023-2028:

**BJS not fully implemented in the BARMM.** As provided in Article X of the BOL, the BJS shall be administered in accordance with the unique cultural and historical heritage of the Bangsamoro and shall be in consonance with the Constitution, Shari'ah, traditional or tribal laws, and other relevant laws. The Bangsamoro government is yet to establish and operationalize the BJS structure in the region.

**Lack of Shari'ah judges and personnel for Shari'ah courts.** In 2019, the JBC has created 48 SCC under the jurisdiction of the SDC in the BARMM. While only 33 of the SCC are organized, and 15 are not yet organized which are situated in Tawi-Tawi and Basilan provinces. There is a necessity of establishing additional Shari'ah courts within and outside the region. During the BJS subsector consultation, it was mentioned that the reason why the Supreme Court did not establish additional Shari'ah courts is because of the lesser statistics of cases recorded. Another factor contributing to the lack of Shari'ah judges and personnel for Shari'ah Courts is the inorganization of the Integrated Shari'ah Bar of the Philippines.

**Less prioritization on Shari'ah capacity development.** There is less priority on capacity development on Shari'ah resulting to lesser number of capacitated Shari'ah practitioners. Also, the lack of training hampered the gradual appointment of qualified Shari'ah judges.

Presently, the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF) is the only recognized institution by the Supreme Court of the Philippines to facilitate training on Shari'ah subjects which is included in the requirements for taking the Special Shari'ah Bar Examination. However, the NCMF training is very limited in the number of slots for their accommodation. Meanwhile, being a college graduate with a bachelor's degree in Shari'ah is not sufficient for taking the special bar examination as they also need to undergo training from the NCMF to secure a certificate from the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court through the Office of the Bar Confidant conducts the Special Shari'ah Bar Examination only once every two years upon the request of the Secretary/ Chief Executive Officer of the NCMF.

As a result, there is inadequate pool of highly specialized and qualified Shari'ah practitioners in the BARMM to fill in the vacant plantilla positions in the Shari'ah courts.

**Slow implementation of BOL provision on BJS.** Reiterated in Title V, Section 12B of the BAA 13, Shari'ah Public Assistance Office will be headed by a director assisted by two counselors who are members of the Philippine Shari'ah Bar and they shall be assisted by an immediate staff. The director and two Shari'ah counselors shall be appointed by the Chief Minister. The Shari'ah Public Assistance Office is mandated to provide free legal assistance to poor or indigent party litigants.

Currently, the Shari'ah Public Assistance Office has not been fully established and operationalized. No resolutions to facilitate the immediate organization of the office that would primarily provide free legal assistance to indigent party litigants; prepare and file petitions, complaints, and/or responsive pleadings, and represent indigent defendants in ordinary civil actions, special civil actions, special proceedings and in any stage criminal proceedings before the Shari'ah Courts.

The same applied to the Office for Traditional Justice System. As per Section 27, D of the BAA 13, the Office for Traditional Justice system will be the primary responsible for overseeing the study, preservation, and development of traditional or tribal justice systems within the BARMM and it shall be attached to the OCM. Up to this date, these offices have not yet been brought before the Bangsamoro Parliament.

Full implementation of these laws will significantly increase access to the justice system and swift resolution of disputes, especially among the poor and marginalized groups. In return, it will increase the trust and confidence of the public. Greater access to justice comes with immense benefits for societies, including improving social cohesion and people's well-being.

**Absence of BTA Legislation on the implementation of the Bangsamoro Justice System.** The absence of policy issuance or support for the complementation of the multi-judicial system of the Bangsamoro may cause confusion to the people in determining the applicable laws to their concerns, given the multi-racial occurrence in the BARMM.

The multi-judicial system in the Bangsamoro is composed of the Shari'ah, Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), Customary Laws, Tribal, and Regular Courts. The inadequacy in the awareness of this multi-judicial system leads to a very low public trust in the justice system that may cause community disorder and conflicts. Poor people tend to put the law into their own hands and refuse to elevate the case to the proper court.

In the case of ADR, there are no funds allocated for the Council of Elders to motivate them in resolving disputes. As a result, they are not interested in the arising altercations in their surroundings which lead to serious conflicts. Moreover, the Council of Elders is not properly identified to preserve their status in their community.

**Weak coordination among the five pillars of the justice system: Law enforcement, prosecution, courts, correction, community.** The BARMM needs a strengthened five pillars of the Criminal Justice System (CJS) for a just, inclusive, and accessible Philippine judicial system. The Criminal Justice System (CJS) shall consist of a series of actions, tasks, or activities that will constitute the formal response to perceived law-and-order issues: crime prevention and reduction; the arrest and prosecution of suspects; and the hearing of criminal cases by the courts.

According to the assessment of PDP 2023-2028, despite the positive developments, there are still lacking in the policy reforms and key legislations. The CJS in the Philippines is composed of five pillars - law enforcement, prosecution, the courts, correction, and the community. It was found out in the PDP that the fragmentation of the CJS remains a challenge; backlogs in resolving cases, delays caused by inefficient practices, and aging persist; limited resources weaken the justice sector; and low public confidence in the justice system undermines the rule of law. Also, there is a possibility of undue administration of justice such as the absence of preliminary investigation, untimely or no delivery of subpoena, no arraignment, and other due processes.

These problems mainly affect the implementation of programs and strengthening coordination. In the BARMM, the surging number of crimes keep on flashing on the news, but the authorities would only say that the proper investigation will be done. What the people want to see is minimal crime incidence. The prompt action of the authorities in the repression of criminals must be strengthened. The coordination among pillars of the justice system shall be strengthened to oversee the implementation of strict monitoring of the progress of the cases and imposing penalties on erring lawyers.

The court pillar plays a major role in the resolution of cases. They shall carefully evaluate the information and pieces of evidence before pursuing a hearing and rendering a final judgment. In this pillar, the number of cases also affects the functions of the judges such as the speedy trial. This requires sufficient facilities and an increased number of judges to facilitate the adjudication of cases. Furthermore, the court shall strengthen its coordination among other pillars for the proper administration of justice.

The necessity of strengthening the administration of justice to prevent injustices in the future is also crucial. There are cases that reached the Supreme Court petitioning for the grave abuse of discretion of the judges. Hence, a policy strengthening the coordination and monitoring mechanism for the administration of justice is indispensable.

The first to uphold the law is the law enforcement pillar. It represents public authority and is in charge of preserving public safety and order. This pillar must remain strong in order for the populace to be responsive and involved in achieving due process. The BARMM is responsible for closely monitoring law enforcement activities and enforcing sanctions for improper use of force.

There is a real pushback in the correction pillar. The rampant crimes in the BARMM could be an implication of the failure of reformation and rehabilitation of the offenders. The Bangsamoro government shall provide support to the programs and projects for reformation and rehabilitation in preventing recidivism cases. Additionally, those found guilty of ta'azir charges, which are minor infractions punishable by Shari'ah courts, must be imprisoned in separate institutions while serving their terms in order to avoid further influence from those with major offenses and to ensure their prompt reformation.

The LGUs as part of the community pillar plays a major role in the development of the justice system in the Bangsamoro. The MILG-BARMM as its counterpart is mandated to promote peace and order, ensure public safety, and further strengthen local government capability aimed toward the effective delivery of basic services to the citizenry. Through LGUs, the Bangsamoro government can contribute to easy access of the poor or vulnerable groups to justice.

Also, poor litigants' access to available legal services may be hampered by a lack of awareness on their part. The costs incurred during hearings and other legal proceedings are another common factor that contributes to injustices.

Furthermore, there should be a mechanism for inter-agency dialogue and coordinated implementation of reforms in the justice system.

## Priority Policy and Legislative Agenda

**Bangsamoro Revenue Code.** This shall cover taxing powers of the Bangsamoro Government, in accordance with the Constitution and the BOL.

**Bangsamoro Investment Code.** This shall cover the matters relating to investments and incentives regulations that will be applied in the Bangsamoro Region.

**Bangsamoro Budget System Act.** This shall provide for the creation of the Bangsamoro Budget Office (BBO) under the control and supervision of the MFBM, and is primarily mandated to promote the sound, efficient, and effective management, and utilization of all resources of the Bangsamoro Government.

**Bangsamoro Islamic Banking and Finance.** This covers matters pertaining to legal and regulatory framework for Islamic Banking and Finance in Bangsamoro, recognizes the vital role of Islamic banking and finance in creating opportunities for greater financial inclusion, and discusses this system of finance based on Islamic law.

**Bangsamoro Local Governance Code.** This shall provide for a more responsive and accountable local government structure instituted through a system of decentralization whereby constituent local government units shall be given more powers, authority, responsibilities, and resources in a gradual and systematic approach.

This policy agenda intends to support sub-sector objectives on strengthening the delivery of public service; and strengthening and enhancing local government administration and supervision; as well as in achieving the ideal functionality and performance of LGUs.

**Bangsamoro Electoral Code.** This code is proposed to be promulgated to prescribe the structural, functional, and procedural principles in the elections of officers within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, and secure honest, credible, just, and free elections thereby allowing democratic political participation and reflecting the genuine will of the electorate.

**Enactment of Bangsamoro Code of Muslim Personal Laws.** This priority legislative agenda tends to enforce and harmonize the application of laws in all Shari'ah Courts in the Philippines. This will pave way in establishing and operationalizing the structures of BJS in the BARMM and will set in motion an institutionalized coordination mechanism between the Supreme Court of the Philippines and the Bangsamoro government.

Presidential Decree 1083 provides for the general enactment on Administration of Muslim Personal Laws. The Code of Muslim Personal Laws (CMPL) refers to the law that governs the family and personal relations of the Muslim Filipinos. This decree recognizes the legal system of Muslims in the Philippines as part of the law of the land, codifies Muslim personal laws, and provides for the administration and enforcement of the Code through the establishment of Shari'ah courts.

**Codification of ADR mechanisms in resolving tribal disputes.** The Codification of the ADR will pave way to the use of the alternative dispute system as well as the establishment or appointment of focal office to implement the ADR. ADR has emerged as the key to decongesting court dockets. It's a process or procedure used to resolve a dispute or controversy, other than by adjudication of a presiding judge of a court or an officer of a government agency in which a neutral third party participates to assist in the resolution of issues. There are three types of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms: conciliation, mediation, and arbitration incorporating provisions that will strengthen the partnership among BARMM MOAs and other non-state actors.

**An enabling law for open governance.** Inspired by the Open Government Partnership initiative, the concept of Bangsamoro open governance is committed to the principles of inclusive participation, promoting transparency, fighting corruption, empowering the Bangsamoro people and leveraging on technology to strengthen local moral governance. The values of transparency and open government is crucial to make government information more accessible and available through the use of technology to ensure accountability.

This policy agenda intends to support the sub-sector objective of strengthening transparency and accountability mechanisms for a more inclusive and open participation in governmental processes.

Fiscal openness will provide the platform to inform the Bangsamoro people and local and international partners on regional and local governance, maximize engagement and establish citizen feedback mechanisms to help fight corruption.

**Strengthen the standardization of monitoring and evaluation mechanism of the Bangsamoro Government and Local Development Council of BARMM LGUs.** The standardized M&E mechanism shall provide a scheme for the Bangsamoro government and Local Development Council in monitoring and evaluation of development programs or projects in the BARMM.

**Bangsamoro Government Communications Policy.** This encompasses the central objectives and principles for the Bangsamoro government's communication with its constituents, civil society organizations, academe, businesses, and other stakeholders. The principles of the policy will serve as the basis for all the BARMM MOAs on how communication will operate within government departments and across the regional government, mainland, and island provinces.

This policy agenda intends to support the sub-sectoral objective of strengthening data and communications management. Moreover, it shall serve as a framework in the development of communication plans and strategies for the government.

**Creation of Bangsamoro Human Settlements Adjudication Commission.** The Commission shall assume and continue to perform the adjudication functions of the former HLURB-ARMM, now Ministry of Human Settlements and Development (MHSD) - BARMM, and shall be attached to the Ministry for policy, planning and program coordination only. In the performance of its functions, the Commission shall be guided by the Constitutional provision that affords all persons the right to a speedy disposition of their cases before all judicial, quasi-judicial or administrative bodies. Toward this end, the independence of the adjudication process and the speedy resolution of disputes involving housing and real estate development and transactions, land use, and HOAs within BARMM jurisdiction shall be ensured, and all parties to these controversies shall be accorded equal access to legal processes.

# Chapter 6: Mainstreaming of Bangsamoro Cultural Diversity, Beliefs, Heritage, and Identity

Section 24, Article IX of RA 11054 known as the BOL provides that the Bangsamoro government shall preserve the history, culture, arts, traditions, and the rich cultural heritage of the Bangsamoro people and their Sultanates, such as those of Sulu, Maguindanao, Kabuntalan, Buayan, the Royal House of Ranao and of the Iranun, and the non-Moro indigenous peoples of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

Pursuant to the said provision of the BOL, the Bangsamoro government identified Bangsamoro culture, heritage, identity, and diversity as the twelfth priority of the enhanced 12-Point Priority Agenda of the BARMM. This chapter aims to contribute in Agenda No. 7 of the 8-Point Socioeconomic Agenda of the Marcos Administration, and SDGs 10, 11, and 17.

This Chapter discusses the current situation, priority challenges, and opportunities for the preservation and promotion of identity and diverse culture in BARMM. It also sets forth the goal, objectives, strategies, and priority interventions laid out by the Bangsamoro government for the next six years. This features the unique culture and identity of the BARMM.

## Sectoral Assessment

### Sectoral Trends

**Bangsamoro culture and identity recognized.** The term Moro is a diverse category, with great variation culturally and linguistically, as well as in religiosity and the adherence to Islamic teachings (Paredes, 2015). It was initially a derogatory term applied by the Spanish colonizers who battled the 'Moors' in the Iberian Peninsula - modern Spain and Portugal, implemented aggressive anti-Muslim policies.

The Maguindanaon, Meranao, Iranun or Iranaun, Tausug, Yakan, and other cultural groups retain distinct traditions and identities, their shared historical identification with Islam and a shared history of being targeted by colonial and post-colonial state persecution (ibid). Over time, the term Moro was eventually embraced as a collective identifier. Most recently, the term is prefixed by the Malay word "Bangsa", which means nation, to suggest a collective name for all Moro peoples in the Philippines and their homeland.

The Bangsamoro diverse culture and identity have been historically recognized in different literatures as basis of identifying and naming the sea between the island of Mindanao and Palawan as Sulu Sea, the country's largest gulf located in the off coast of Mindanao as Moro Gulf and, a large bay of the Moro Gulf, off the southwestern coast of Mindanao island as Ilana Bay, also known as the Iranun/Iranaun Bay. In fact, the island of Mindanao was identified and named as Moro land during the American regime. It was administered separately from the islands of Visayas and Luzon until the promulgation of the 1935 Philippine Constitution despite the vehement resistance of the Bangsamoro.

Bangsamoro culture and identity is also legally recognized through the provision of the 1987 Constitution particularly Article X, Section 15, which provides among others that "There shall be created an Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao." Presidential Decree 1083 was decreed allowing the Muslims to exercise their own law on personal and property relation other than the Philippine Civil Code. This led to the creation of Shari'ah legal system including Shari'ah Courts in the country.

Another recognition is the establishment of Ministry of Muslim Affairs (MMA) by virtue of EO 697 issued on May 28, 1981, which was replaced by the Office on Muslim Affairs (OMA) two months later to minimize the number of ministries at that time. It was replaced by the National Commission of Muslim Filipinos (NCMF) by virtue of RA 9997 known as National Commission on Muslim Filipinos Act of 2009. Eventually, the enactment of RA 6734 as amended by RA 9054 and finally eventual passage of RA 11054 known as the BOL.

**Appreciation of Bangsamoro culture and identity is gradually decreasing.** The Bangsamoro are known for their rich and distinct beliefs, culture, and identity for which they fought for and struggled many decades and even centuries before. The battle cry was "it is better to die than to have two identities". This means the Bangsamoro prefer to lose their lives rather than to surrender their identity as Muslim. This battle cry remains in the hearts of the Bangsamoro generation.

However, the Bangsamoro culture and identity that includes arts, sports, music, and others are not much appreciated nor practiced by most of the new generation nowadays due to exposure to foreign cultures, languages, and practices brought about by modern lifestyle and social inclination. They choose to busy themselves with the various social media and its fad than learning their own culture and identity.

**Traditional practices are becoming less popular and less visible.** Thirty years ago, the Bangsamoro traditional practices were common to everyone. On many occasions, the people gathered and feasted on special native delicacies as a gesture of kinship, unity, and solidarity. Indigenous musical instruments were abundant in the Bangsamoro areas. These handcrafted instruments were played during festivals and auspicious occasions. At present, they have become rare and authentic artists are difficult to find. Even worse, majority of the new generation have no knowledge about Bangsamoro history and traditional practices.

Before, the Bangsamoro customary laws of Walay na Bityara in Maguindanaons, Taritib ago Igma of Maranaos, Baitsyara of the people of island provinces and other customs and traditions are observed and effectively used as way of regulating societal affairs. Nowadays, it is very seldom to find someone adept with these customs and traditions.

**Traditional sports, arts, and music slowly forgotten.** With the advent of the modern sports and music coupled with the use of modern gadgets and instruments, the Bangsamoro traditional games, arts, and music are slowly fading and being forgotten. The following are some of the waning Bangsamoro traditional sports and music:

### Table 6.1 Bangsamoro Traditional Sports and Music

| Bangsamoro Traditional Sports | Bangsamoro Traditional Music |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 1. Kakhoya or local version of Marathon (track and field) | 1. Kakholintang, kaagong, kadbak, kapamamundiran, kaphandaopan |
| 2. Kaphaso or local version of horse racing | 2. Kapangotyapi |
| 3. Kazipa sa Manggis for male | 3. Kapangobing |
| 4. Kazipa sa Lama for female | 4. Kapangintsi |
| 5. Kathakian for boys | |
| 6. Kathipho local version of long jump | |
| 7. Kambalintad for girls | |
| 8. Kambiko for girls and boys | |
| 9. Kanggalawanga | |
| 10. Kangalazoga | |
| 11. Kangugorowa | |

**Bangsamoro historical sites are given less importance thereby losing value and significance.** Due to the absence of consolidated and comprehensive Bangsamoro history; the advent of modernization, and the impact of climate change, the value and significance of the Bangsamoro historical sites are gradually disappearing. This is worsened by the absence of relevant regional policies on the preservation and development of historical sites and cultural heritage.

Under Section 26, Article IX of the BOL, the national government shall transfer the management of Bangsamoro historical and cultural sites currently under the jurisdiction of the National Museum of the Philippines, National Historical Commission of the Philippines, and other agencies of the national government to the Bangsamoro Commission for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage (BCPCH). This will be done through intergovernmental relations mechanisms. The BCPCH shall coordinate with relevant agencies of the national government on the regulation, excavation, and preservation of cultural artifacts and on the recovery of lost historical and cultural heritage.

**Tangible and intangible cultural heritages are vanishing.** Bangsamoro identity through visual and other forms of arts will be extinct sooner than our younger generations might realize. There is but limited knowledge on the historical significance of tangible cultural heritage and properties as well as the intangible cultures of the Bangsamoro. In addition to natural disasters, human-induced calamities threaten the destruction and loss of physical entities related to the uniqueness of the Bangsamoro culture. Being susceptible to transport, most of them were sold, transferred, lost, and gradually forgotten.

## Development Opportunities

**Existence of local cultural artists.** Local cultural artists are among the bearers of our cultures through arts. They are the catalysts of the Bangsamoro creative industry which is a growing field in global life. This industry will provide economic growth and decent work for the Bangsamoro cultural artists. In addition, local cultural artists contribute to sustainable tourism that promotes local culture and products. Hence, the remaining existing local cultural artist is a great opportunity in preserving and promoting Bangsamoro culture. They can be utilized as instruments to preserve and develop the cultural arts.

**Presence of cultural arts center.** Cultural centers are spaces for cultural heritage appreciation and artistic growing. It contributes to the efforts to protect and safeguard the Bangsamoro cultural heritage. Moreover, the presence of cultural centers in the region is another opportunity to preserve, develop, and promote culture, and further contribute to sustainable tourism that provides economic opportunities.

**Presence of schools of living tradition (SLT).** In safeguarding intangible cultural heritage, SLT provide a venue to continue the transmission of knowledge to younger generation. It intends to develop traditional cultures such as arts or crafts. It also encourages the culture masters to continue their work in teaching and promoting the cultural heritage and raise more awareness to the community. The presence of SLT in the region provides an opportunity in preserving the Bangsamoro culture.

**Availability of cultural and historical reading material written in local language.** Bangsamoro languages are one of the endangered languages that believed to be lost in the next generation. In order to preserve this culture and its language, it is important to make them available in reading materials. Thus, Bangsamoro languages used in reading materials is an opportunity to transfer the knowledge of the language and culture to the young and the next generations.

---

## Priority Challenges to be Addressed Within 2023-2028

**Declining appreciation and valuation of Bangsamoro cultural heritage.** It is observed that some of the new generations are gradually losing their appreciation and valuation on culture and heritage. This is partly due to the absence of integrated and comprehensive Bangsamoro history that will help them understand the past and the journey of their forefathers. Another factor is poor promotion initiatives in multimedia, lack of reading materials, and other platforms. Thus, the value and appreciation of the Bangsamoro culture and heritage is declining in the region.

**Undermining Bangsamoro identity.** The Bangsamoro is an ethnolinguistic mosaic made up of at least 13 Islamized, non-Islamized, and indigenous groups. As envisioned in the peace agreements, measures to sustain long-term stability shall ensure the inclusion of the minorities, women, and youth. However, low initiatives and learning spaces to engage them in understanding the Bangsamoro history pose a greater challenge, and this weakens the foundation of cultural heritage and identity. Without a strong foundation, it contributes to low interest and awareness of Bangsamoro history and culture. Considering the important role of the youth in the preservation of culture and identity, there is a need to ensure transfer of knowledge and practices to the younger generation who will continue to preserve the Bangsamoro culture and identity.

**Insufficient resources for comprehensive Bangsamoro historical culture and identity.** Although majority of cultural heritage are informal, unprotected, and not explicitly managed, it plays a significant role in both economic and social life because they are the primary institutions that link people. The cultural backdrop of social existence is defined by history, territory, and society. To date, no institution has concentrated on Bangsamoro history intending to build a library of records, objects, and artifacts. Challenges include insufficient and limited inventory and resources encompassing the history, culture, and identity along with the limited number of Bangsamoro historians and cultural experts as well as limited innovative and creative platform to showcase the Bangsamoro culture and identity.

**Weak policies on cultural and historical preservation and innovation.** Currently, the BARMM is adopting the existing national policies on cultural preservation and development. This needs to be localized to promote the distinct culture of the region. Also, weak policies on cultural preservation and promotion can be attributed to limited coordination among BARMM MOAs, poor functionality of local council for culture and arts, non-mainstreaming of culture and identity to governance, lack of cultural product marketing, innovation, and incentives.

## Sectoral Assessment

### Sectoral Trends

**BARMM has huge potential for economic activities.** It is rich in natural resources that can be used to contribute to the growth of the national economy. The natural terrain of the BARMM is diverse, with lakes, rivers, marshes, mountain ranges, valleys, substantial stretches of fertile land, and maritime resources. However, this huge potential has not been optimized due to the violent conflict that fraught the region, weak institutional support, and the informality that defined the rules governing economic activities for decades.

### Land as an Economic Asset Has Not Been Optimized

A key economic asset that has been left idle and unproductive is land. BARMM has the largest land area in the country, accounting for 11.17 percent of the total land area, and hosts 10 of the 128 Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) in the country. About 628,401 hectares are classified as alienable and disposable while 665,151 hectares are classified as forest land. In addition, a total of 340,486 hectares are covered under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP). These values are the highest in the country. It carries enormous potential as a source of income, food, employment, investment, and housing. But due to the absence of a comprehensive and inclusive land governance framework and the complexity that comes in the plurality of systems (legal, traditional, and informal systems), the potential of land as an economic asset has not been realized. Worse, it has been a significant cause of conflict, death, and displacement of civilians.

In an effort to address land conflict in the region, ministries who are directly and indirectly dealing with lands and its beneficiaries are now converging among themselves to strengthen collaboration with an end to improve delivery of public services while continuing the effort to provide free legal services, especially to agrarian reform beneficiaries and concerned landowners.

Maguindanao has the lion's share of the regional alienable and disposable (A&D) lands at 49 percent, followed by Lanao del Sur at 21 percent. In terms of forest land, Lanao del Sur registered the highest share at 38 percent, followed by Maguindanao at 30 percent. In terms of coverage under the CARP, Lanao del Sur registered the highest share at 48 percent followed by Maguindanao at 28 percent inclusive of Cotabato City and the SGA.

### High Rate of Contested Lands in BARMM

About 16 percent or 213,196.17 hectares of the land area are considered contested. 57 percent of the contested lands are in Lanao del Sur, accounting for 28.7 percent of the provincial land. Maguindanao has the second-highest number of contested lands, accounting for 31 percent of the total land area in BARMM and 13.15 percent of the provincial land.

### Gaps Persist in Land Distribution and Tenurial Security

From the total CARP scope of 340,486.8532 hectares as of December 2021, only 68 percent or 229,972.9852 hectares had been distributed under the CARP. This means that 110,513.8680 hectares are yet to be distributed. Lanao del Sur registered the highest distribution rate at 82 percent, followed by Basilan at 68 percent while Maguindanao posted the lowest rate of distribution at 48 percent.

In terms of the provision of support services, a total of 104 Agrarian Reform Communities (ARCs) have been established, launched, and are able to organize a total of 240 Agrarian Reform Beneficiary Organizations (ARBOs). The formation of ARCs and ARBOs is one of the strategies of the program to help maximize the chances of Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries (ARBs) to avail interventions both local and foreign assisted. It is a fact that most of the interventions especially from foreign donors are course through cooperatives or organized groups, thus the formation of ARCs and ARBOs. A total of 34,743 ARBs have been assisted as of October 2019. Support includes: training (soft component) and the delivery of farm input support, common service facilities, and infrastructures (hard component).

**Agriculture and fishery are BARMM's main sources of food, employment, and income.** It used to be the largest contributor to the region's overall economy 21 years ago, accounting for more than half of the region's economy. With the growth of the services sector, it is now the second-highest contributor to the region's economy, accounting for 36.41 percent in 2021. This structural transformation, however, does not mean that the sector is weakening or becoming less relevant. In fact, it is one of the biggest contributors that caused the region to be resilient at the time of the pandemic, registering the lowest decline among the regions in the Philippines in 2020.

### Seaweeds as BARMM's Top Commodity

BARMM is the country's largest seaweed producer, accounting for 48.42 percent of the country's seaweed production. Tawi-Tawi is the main source of seaweed production in BARMM, registering more than 90 percent of regional production. The municipalities in Sitangkai and Sibutu islands are the largest seaweed culture areas in Tawi-Tawi province. The comparative advantage and market potential for carrageenan as an export product of seaweeds remains high in the region.

To sustain the seaweed production, BARMM must invest in the post-harvest processing plant and modernized facilities/equipment or the overall value-chain development of the seaweeds industry, establish municipal-wide seaweed nursery, and strengthen seaweed research and development in order to have full control from production to marketing.

### High-Value Crops on the Rise in BARMM

Valued by small-scale farmers for its tolerance and growth, cassava is the second top commodity of BARMM based on percent share, accounting for 41.7 percent of the country's total cassava production. As a complement or alternative to rice and corn as a staple food, cassava was ranked significantly high in terms of volume of production and area harvested. Its yield in 2020 was close to the national average. Lanao del Sur was the largest contributor to regional cassava production in 2020, accounting for 47 percent.

BARMM is the country's second-largest producer of mangosteen, accounting for 22.4 percent of the country's production. It is the country's third largest producer of rubber, coffee, lanzones, and corn, contributing 18.4 percent, 17.4 percent, 15.3 percent, and 14 percent, respectively. In addition, the region is the second-largest producer of durian and the 5th largest producer of abaca.

### BARMM Has Higher Productivity Than the National Average in Six Out of 10 Leading Commodities

Rubber, coffee, coconut, durian, mung bean, and abaca are the six commodities in which BARMM registered higher productivity than the national average. On the other hand, cassava, mangosteen, lanzones, and corn are the commodities in which BARMM registered lower productivity than the national average.

### Bangsamoro Strategic Agricultural and Fisheries Development Areas (BSAFDA)

The BSAFDA was identified as the essential supporting strategy in the attainment of various development goals and priority agenda in the region, namely: zero hunger; sustainable agri-fishery production; consumption; and food security.

All identified agri-fishery and agro-industrial areas clustered under BSAFDA in the Bangsamoro region shall form part of the Network of Protected Areas for Fishery, Agricultural and Agro-Fishery Industrial Development (NPAFAAD) to avoid illegal land use conversions and to protect the welfare of the farmers and as well as the Bangsamoro people through food security and sustainable agri-fishery production and agro-industrial establishment in achieving the Bangsamoro that is socioeconomically stable, resilient and globally competitive farmers and fisherfolks.

Currently, the identified BSAFDAs cover about 628,872.64 hectares for agricultural production and 125,562.44 for inland fishing as shown in Table 7.5 below. Maguindanao del Sur has the largest agriculture and inland fishery areas included in the protected networks.

About 92.70 percent of the total volume of fisheries production in BARMM was composed of the top 10 species during the first quarter of 2021. Seaweed posted the highest level of production in the region during this period. Its production increased by 2.56 percent between the first quarters of 2020 and 2021. This was followed by Frigate tuna (Tulingan), Roundscad (Galunggong), Big-eyed scad (Matangbaka) and Eastern little tuna (Bonito).

The region has 113 municipalities, 52 of these are coastal municipalities and 45 are inland municipalities. The second largest lake in the country is found in Lanao del Sur with an approximate area of 34,700 hectares. Lake Lanao is the deepest in the country and is considered one of the major tropical lakes in Southeast Asia. It is the source of hydroelectric power for the whole island of Mindanao aside from providing irrigation water and various fish products. Other lakes like Dapao in Lanao del Sur, Buluan and Balut in Maguindanao, Seit and Panamao in Sulu, Danao and Singuang in Mapun, Tawi-Tawi, and similar bodies of water are also potential resources of commercial scale fish products. The region has the largest share of swamp area with around 105,000 hectares and is being programmed for extensive agricultural and fishery development.

The region has the highest registered fisherfolk population in the country. As of December 2018, a total of 252,758 fisherfolks were registered in the Fisherfolks Registration (FishR) system. Of these, 162,167 are male and 90,951 are female; 102,996 are engaged in capture fishing; 45,275 are in aquaculture; 17,168 in fish vending; 23,251 in gleaning; 9,363 in fish processing; and 16,765 are engaged in other types of fishing activities.

For the period of 2014 up to 2018, fisheries production increased every year except in 2016 and 2017 due to typhoons and dry spells that affected the production of commercial and municipal fish products. Aquaculture has, however, continuously increased.

Moreover, in terms of fisheries value of production, the region has Php24,931,125.26 in 2021. The contribution came from the municipal, aquaculture, marine municipal, commercial, and inland municipal fisheries. As for the seaweeds, the Bangsamoro region remained the highest producer in the whole country with a total of 720,300.94 metric tons.

Tawi-Tawi and Sulu Provinces must develop their potential in establishing a commercial scale nursery, hatchery, and grow-out for grouper, abalone, sea cucumber, and other high-value commercial fish in order to boost their economy and possibly exporting of their product. A small-scale canning industry is very potential due to the abundant source of freshwater, but one of its challenges is the insufficient power supply in the island provinces.

### Livestock and Poultry Production as an Important Economic Activity

An important segment of the agriculture industry is the production of livestock and poultry. Animals are raised by households for either consumption or market sale. BARMM's potential in Halal meat production and manufacturing can be explored now that there is a rising demand for halal products. In terms of livestock production by animal type in the region, in 2021, carabao tops the production, followed by cattle, and goats.

### Food Security Remains to be a Challenge in BARMM

This relative advantage in agriculture, forestry, and fishery did not translate to sustained food security. BARMM is a significant contributor to rice in Mindanao. The region contributes 16.5 percent to Mindanao palay production. Heavy investments in rice and corn yielded growth in production, but productivity remains low. The yield per hectare in 2020 was only 3.11 mt. compared to the country's average of 4.09 mt. (PSA 2022). In fact, this gap widened considering the average yield in the past years from 2011 to 2020. BARMM's productivity during this period was only 2.77 tons per hectare, significantly lower compared to the national average yield of 3.93 tons per hectare in the same period. As compared with other Mindanao regions, BARMM registered the lowest yield except for 2019.

| Region | Percent Share |
|--------|---------------|
| Region XII | 29% |

The lack of required infrastructure and access to technology resulted in pre- and post-harvest losses and inefficiency, leading to low profitability among farmers and fisherfolks. In fact, farmers and fisherfolks are among the poorest sectors of the population. Subsistence incidence, a measure on the proportion of families with difficulty in accessing basic food requirements, was highest in 2018 at 23.3 percent. In 2021, the region was ranked second at 8.8 percent.

**Figure 7.16 Subsistence Incidence, BARMM vs. Philippines, 2015-2021**

All provinces registered a decline in subsistence incidence in 2021. Among the BARMM provinces, Sulu registered the highest at 17.1 percent followed by Basilan at 16.3 percent in the same period. On the other hand, Cotabato City registered an increase from 2018 to 2021.

### Barter Trade as an Income Support Mechanism

Barter trading has been the dominant type of trading in the BARMM for years. In the Sulu archipelago, barter is characterized by inter-familial transactions between Sama Badjaos from Tawi-Tawi and Sabah, Malaysia where consensual arrangements are bestowed tolerance by local authorities in Sabah. In Tawi-Tawi, the resources for each trading run of a wooden-hull vessel pool the resources of the vessel owner and his crew and financial capital from teachers, entrepreneurs, policemen and other individuals (Quitoriano, 2022). In Panglima Sugala (Tawi-Tawi), market days are characterized by food exchanges between farmers and fisherfolks based on relationship and social trust, not price mechanisms. When the value of a farmer's product is lower than the fisherfolks, the latter is given the privilege to access the farm to compensate for the gap in value. So, while barter trade is essential in the informal economy, it served as a potent safety net and social protection facility that are absent in the formal economy, particularly in times of crisis or periods of scarcity. One example was the continuing trade between the Sulu Archipelago and Sabah despite the restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (Franco, 2021).

### Most MSMEs in BARMM are in the Informal Sector

Due to the fragility of the region, a large part of the business sector, particularly the MSMEs, are in the informal sector. This implies that many operate beyond the rules, regulations, and support of the state, leading to low quality of products and services, low productivity, and limited legal and social protections for workers. More critically, the MSMEs' potential to contribute to broad-based growth and state building has not been optimized.

A starting point in formalizing the MSMEs is business name registration (BNR) which is a frontline service of the MTIT. The Philippines' BNR system is the portal for the registration of MSMEs under single-proprietorship ownership. This registration will provide legal identity and will gain the rights to use the chosen business name. Once registered, MSMEs engaged in trading, retailing, manufacturing, and services can receive various capacity development support such as enterprise skills training, digital literacy, product pricing and packaging.

### More Than a Hundred-Fold Increase in Business Name Registration in BARMM in 2021

In 2021, a total of 8,427 MSMEs have registered, a 161.46 percent increase from the number in 2020. It is the highest in a span of five years. Such an increase was a manifestation of the resilience of the Bangsamoro entrepreneurs given the lingering effects of the pandemic.

**Figure 7.18 BARMM BNR, 2017-2021**

| Year | Number of BNR |
|------|---------------|
| 2017 | 2,575 |
| 2018 | 2,881 |

| 2020 | 3,572 |
| 2021 | 8,427 |

*Source: MTIT*

For two years (2020-2021), BARMM has registered 11,650 businesses through its five provincial offices including Cotabato City and created 31,000 jobs and generated an investment of around 2.5 billion pesos.

### BARMM Accounts Less Than One Percent of the Total BNR in the Country

Despite a significant increase in the BNR in 2021, BARMM still registered the lowest BNRs in the country, accounting for only 0.92 percent.

### Table 7.9 BNRs, Percent Share, National vs. BARMM, 2017-2021

| | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2021 |
|---------|------|------|------|------|
| National | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| BARMM | 0.34 | 0.24 | 0.33 | 0.92 |

*Source: MTIT*

Table 7.9 implies that intensified efforts are needed in the campaign on the formalization of the businesses in the BARMM. However, the work remains herculean as tens of thousands are estimated to remain in the informal sector.

### Maguindanao Outpaced Lanao del Sur BNRs in 2021

From 2017 to 2020, Lanao del Sur used to be the leading province in terms of BNR. In 2021, Maguindanao outpaced Lanao del Sur, accounting for more than half of the total BNR in the region in 2021. A 308.76 percent increase in BNRs was recorded in the province, from only 1,096 in 2020 to 4,480 in 2021.

### MSMEs are Key Engines of Inclusive and Broad-Based Growth

From 2017 to 2021, the total amount of investments generated by MSMEs reached Php 9.02 billion, generating a total of 62,166 jobs within the said period.

But for MSMEs to be competitive and have sustained financial growth, they should have access to technical support, technology, capital or credit, and market access, among others. Access to these various types of government support can only be made possible if they become part of the formal sector.

### Remarkable Growth of Investments as a Sign of Stronger Investors' Confidence

BARMM generated Php25.3 billion worth of investments, 20,103 employment, and 46 Registered Business Enterprises (RBEs) from 2010 to 2021. The province of Maguindanao recorded the highest investments and employment generation with a total of Php16.6 billion and 12,923, respectively, over the 12-year period. On the other hand, the province of Sulu shows the lowest investments and employment generation with a total of Php850.9 million and 170, respectively.

### Untapped Tourism Potential

Due to the long history of violent conflict, BARMM has not been a tourist destination for decades. Investors have been wary of the security issues and the negative perception that the region carries. As a result, BARMM tourism contribution to GDP accounts for only 0.8 percent (PSA, 2018). However, there is a significant wealth of tourism potential, including tourism job creation, which has been untapped for years.

With the significant gains in the peace process as a result of the political settlement, and as the economy opens up for new investments, there is growing interest in the development of tourism potentials in the region. With the opening of flights from Cotabato to Zamboanga and Tawi-Tawi, many felt that this will gradually alter the perception of BARMM from a conflict-ridden region to a tourist destination.

The pandemic brought a new set of challenges to the region in terms of tourism. The thriving of the tourism industry in the region amidst the pandemic was due to local tourism. This exemplified the resilience of the Bangsamoro as the region registered the lowest decline in 2021. Tourism is a sub-sector that carries enormous potential in contributing to the overall economic resiliency of the region.

### A Thousand-Fold Increase in Tourist Arrivals in BARMM in 2021

The pandemic put the tourism sub-sector on a standstill in 2020, causing tourist arrivals to drop to as low as 7,332. But renewed confidence and interest were recorded in 2021 when tourist arrivals grew by more than a thousand-fold at 195,822. However, despite the monumental increase in 2021, the number is still far below as compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2018 and 2019.

### Lanao del Sur is the Leading Tourist Destination in BARMM in a 4-Year Period

Lanao del Sur accounted for 35 percent of the tourist arrivals in BARMM, making it the top tourist destination. It has to be noted that Tawi-Tawi was the leading tourist destination in 2019, accounting for 33.75 percent. With the opening of new flights from Cotabato to Tawi-Tawi in 2022, it is expected that Tawi-Tawi will be able to outpace Lanao del Sur as the leading tourist destination in the region in the next few years.

**Figure 7.21 Percent Share to Region, Tourist Arrivals, by Province, 2018-2021**

| Province | Percent Share |
|----------|---------------|
| Lanao del Sur | 35% |
| Maguindanao | 29% |
| Tawi-Tawi | 29% |
| Basilan | 6% |
| Sulu | 1% |

### Policy Supports Urgently Needed for Ecozone and Freeport Development

BARMM is encouraged to promote and accelerate sound and balanced industrial, economic, and social development through the establishment of special economic zones and free ports in suitable and strategic locations in the Bangsamoro area. However, the identified potential economic zone areas are untapped because there is inadequate community infrastructure that will support economic gains and accessibility to resources and a limited supply of water and electricity for use of the ecozone.

Further, the granting of fiscal incentives which must be anchored in the legislation of the Bangsamoro Economic Zone Authority (BEZA) Law is not yet established. The Manual of Operations which contains the set of guidelines and registration of ecozone developers, locator companies, and other ancillary providers is yet to be amended to integrate with the transition of the region from ARMM to BARMM, and with the intent to simplify the registration process.

By virtue of MMA Act 154 and pursuant to Proclamation No. 01 dated March 15, 2010, the first Freeport and Ecozone were created and established in the ARMM.

Upon the ratification of the BOL, BEZA was created through the authority provided under BAA 13. With the conversion of Polloc Port to Polloc Freeport and Ecozone, it was expected to be the regional economic hub. However, there is a limited expansion of opportunities in industry and services observed in the past couple of years. With lesser capitalization and pouring on investment to venture into the port, the maritime industry became a slow-moving contributor to the economic growth of the region.

### Low Compliance Among Registered Cooperatives in BARMM

There is a total of 12,214 registered cooperatives in BARMM from 2010 to 2020. Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur are the provinces with the highest number of registered cooperatives, accounting to 38.24 percent or 4,671 and 37.29 percent or 4,554, respectively. Producer cooperatives registered the largest share at 37.58 percent or 4,590 registers, followed by Marketing at 27.54 percent or 3,364 and Agricultural at 12.82 percent or 1,566. As of 2020, only 11.66 percent or 1,424 are compliant.

The Bangsamoro Cooperative and Social Enterprise (BCSE) Bill is yet to be approved and passed by the Bangsamoro Parliament. The said bill is essential for the operationalization of the BCSE as this will serve as a legal basis for their existence and strategic planning and programming.

Parallel with the regional government, the Cooperative and Social Enterprise Authority (CSEA) is in its transition phase from being the sole agency mandated to register cooperatives in the defunct ARMM - Cooperative Development Authority (CDA). The policies and guidelines for cooperatives were predominantly aligned with the previous entity, making the newly registered cooperatives, which were mainly composed of former combatants, encounter difficulties in complying the requirements.

Several efforts are being made to institutionalize Social Enterprise (SE) in the region. This was being made due to the lack of national government legislation relating to SE - unlike cooperatives, which existed by virtue of RA 9520. As of now, the Cooperatives and SE sub-sector are in continuing talks with the principal author of the Social Enterprise Bill as one of the steps to the enactment of the said bill.

### Labor Force Participation Rate (LFPR) Was Below the National Average in 2018 and 2019 but Performed Better in 2020

The LFPR in BARMM used to be the lowest in the country. But this exhibited an upward trend in 2019, leading to a higher LFPR than the national average in 2020. However, this remained to be the lowest among the Mindanao regions.

### Unemployment and Underemployment Rates Were Below the National Average and on a Downward Trend

For the past three years, BARMM's unemployment and underemployment rates have been consistently lower than the national average. Further, the said indicators have been on a declining trend. The growth of the industry and services sectors has made the region more resilient to internal and external shocks. Growth in construction, mining, real estate, retail trade, and food and accommodation services provided job opportunities with a reliable and steady stream of income.

However, youth unemployment, self-employment, and low average earnings and wages in the region have to be investigated because these are reflections of limited opportunities in the labor market.

### Highest Out-Migration Rate in the Country

BARMM has Overseas Contract Workers (OCW) strong push factors for out-migration, second to Luzon. It has the highest non-OCW migration.

### Labor Productivity is Far from the Philippine Average in All Economic Sectors

Among the major industry groups, AFF consistently registered the lowest labor productivity at the national level and in BARMM. On the other hand, the industry registered the highest labor productivity. This is why the structural transformation of BARMM has been critical in increasing overall labor productivity.

BARMM registered lower labor productivity in all major industry groups as compared with the national average. Table 7.12 shows the trend of labor productivity by major industry groups from 2012 to 2017 of BARMM and the national average.

## Development Opportunities

**BARMM's rich natural resources.** BARMM is a unique region, having rich natural and cultural resources, natural tourist spots, and diverse wildlife that need to be explored and developed. It has vast tracks of idle lands which could be utilized for agriculture, particularly food security, agro-forestry, manufacturing, and services-related investments such as tourism, retail trade, housing, and among others.

The region is dubbed as the "unpolished gem" of Mindanao with its natural wealth, human resource, and presence of ethnocultural beliefs and traditions. The concept of diversification and value-adding is the key schemes to unlock these potentials.

The region also has a dynamic and relatively young population, with 42 percent belonging to the 15-39-year-old age bracket. Hence, the region has a large pool of highly trainable workforce.

BARMM has the unique opportunity to be a place for nature-based and cultural tourism. Nature-oriented tourism is one of the fastest-growing areas in the tourism industry. The region is a favored nature-based tourism destination as long as relative peace and security are sustained. Given its various natural assets, the region can provide several different nature-based tourism experiences including hiking and trekking/bushwalking, wildlife viewing/birdwatching, swimming and beach experiences, fishing and sailing, scuba diving, camping, biking, water rafting, kayaking, river and inter-island canoeing, and a host of other outdoor activities.

Nature-based tourism activities are wide-ranging and can cater to all agencies. It can range from passive activities such as sightseeing, scenic driving, relaxing by the beach, and dining among the mangroves to hard and soft adventure activities. The key is to provide nature-based tourism activities and destinations that enhance the broader tourism experiences of the visitors. The overall visitor experience in nature-based tourism is inextricably linked with all other aspects of the visitor's total experience - such as transport convenience, food, culture, accommodation, sanitation, and the perceptual quality and feel of the general environment. All of these elements complement each other and together compose an individual's tourism experience. Another unique selling proposition that Bangsamoro could tap into is its Islamic character, through the promotion of Halal tourism and Islamic culture.

**Strategic air and seaports with proximity to the Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA).** The region also has strategic air and seaports with proximity to the BIMP-EAGA, a window and access for more investment opportunities.

The Greater Sulu-Sulawesi Corridor is a maritime corridor that covers North Sulawesi in Indonesia, Sabah in Malaysia, and Mindanao and Palawan in the Philippines. The corridor is mainly determined by the geography of the Sulu-Sulawesi Seas, a highly biodiverse, globally significant biogeographic unit in the heart of the Coral Triangle—the center of the world's highest concentration of marine biodiversity.

Moreover, there are strong historical trade links in the corridor, with trade concentrated between North Sulawesi and Mindanao, and between Sabah and Mindanao. The corridor is also the nerve center of barter trade in BIMP-EAGA, particularly in agriculture and aquaculture products. Transport connectivity consists of port-to-port trade flows and shipping services within the Sulu-Sulawesi seas.

Also, there was the enactment of R.A. 7718, or the Build-Operate and Transfer (BOT) law providing more focus on the Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) which gives more opportunity to both local and foreign investments in the country.

**Global and regional opportunities for tourism, halal, and Islamic finance.** In terms of competitiveness and sustainability, the implementation must include the complete package of assistance - MSME Development Cycle. These include most importantly the provision of high-quality, sophisticated, and standard-compliant production and processing facilities. These interventions are areas of opportunity to partner, converge, and collaborate with partner stakeholders and enablers. There are existing business models and technology that can be adopted for the benefit of MSMEs.

The Strategic Investment Priorities Plan recently approved by the national government identified three registrable investment activities that are unique to BARMM. These are the halal industry, Islamic banking, and BIMP-EAGA-related investment enterprises.

Further, it is privileged to be the only region in the country with its own Bangsamoro Board of Investments (BBOI) that can dispense fiscal and non-fiscal incentives to investors, provided that the amount of investment is below one billion pesos.

There are existing systems on halal, Islamic financing, and e-commerce that the BARMM can explore.

The Bangsamoro Halal Board (BHB), is the policy-making body of the Bangsamoro Government on Halal Industry development and set the overall direction in formulating, advocating, coordinating, overseeing and assessing the implementation of the Bangsamoro Halal Industry Development and Promotion Program such as the following: 1) Adoption of the M.C. 1 series of 2021 otherwise known as the Halal Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR); 2) Operationalization of the Bangsamoro Standards and Halal Testing Laboratory (BHSTL) of the MOST that provides quality, reliable, and impartial analytical testing and calibration services that meet the needs of the customers and the requirements of ISO/IEC 17025:2017; and, 3) Implementation of various Halal PPAs of the MAFAR, MTIT, and MOST i.e. Halal production and establishment of slaughter houses, assistance to MSMEs on the conduct of training/orientation on Halal awareness, food safety, product packaging and labelling, promotion on the Halal Poultry and provision of subsidy for Halal certification and License-To-Operate (LTO), among others.

**Relative peace and stability in formerly conflict-affected communities.** Camps and other communities which suffered from a long history of violent conflict are now accessible.

**Fresh infrastructure investments.** The region has the presence of basic utilities and infrastructure support such as water, telecommunications, power, seaports, airports, roads, and bridges connecting people to markets, safeguards smooth transport of goods and services to ensure everyone including existing and potential investors have a comfortable working and livable place.

**Strong partnership between national government, private sector, and development partners.** There is a solid partnership with the ministries and development partners. The BPDA and MAFAR in collaboration with the World Food Programme (WFP) initiated the creation of the Bangsamoro Food Sufficiency Task Force (BFSTF) to ensure that policies, programs, projects, and activities on achieving food security shall be coordinated, responsive, and effective.

The presence of international development funding institutions as partners towards the economic agenda of the BARMM is just one of the areas of access to finance or financing. Again, appropriate proposed programs will lead to more economic activities' implementation.

Convergence programming is one strategy to explore to maximize the resources of other concerned and partner BARMM MOAs and enable the rights of the small enterprises and local industries equal access to livelihood opportunities.

Partnering with private or business sectors, as major industry players and actors, is an open area of opportunity to lobby policy measures in the creation of a business-friendly enabling environment.

**Public-Private Partnership (PPP).** LGUs are corporate entities. They are by law encouraged and have the authority to enter into PPP for the implementation of revenue-generating projects. The LGUs can leverage their assets such as land, funds from the national government, or own-sourced funds against the investments of the private sector who has the competency to design, construct and develop, operate, and ensure the financial viability/profitability of a tourism site. There are several PPP modalities that LGUs can use, depending on the nature of the project to be implemented. PPPs provide LGUs the opportunity to also earn revenues based on their asset input to the partnership enterprise.

**Inter-LGU Partnership.** If funds are insufficient, LGUs can partner and contribute their respective assets and funds in order to develop and operate a financially viable tourism site. LGUs, together, can also enter into a PPP. Under an inter-LGU partnership, the contribution made to the partnership by each LGU can be valued as the basis for the value of its capital and therefore share in the revenues. A separate management entity can be organized, or this can be outsourced to a contracted private sector.

**National-Local Partnership.** The province and/or municipalities can partner with national government agencies in order to develop and operate a tourism site. For example, a partnership with the DENR for the grant of usufruct rights or special purpose use of protected areas for tourism activities can be made wherein both parties generate revenues out of the proceeds.

**Grant Funds.** There are national government agencies, such as the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority (TIEZA) that provides financing for the preparation of master plans and feasibility studies for the development of tourism areas, as well as funds for the construction of facilities. The provincial government can avail of these grant funds to finance the detailed design planning and development of the tourism clusters proposed in the tourism development plan. Some development partners also provide technical assistance grants to conduct studies and prepare plans for certain tourism-related activities such as heritage conservation. This is particularly useful in the detailed planning and preparation of urban design guidelines for the cultural heritage districts of Bangsamoro.

**Expanding Governance to Include Enterprise Development.** The Bangsamoro provincial and municipal governments will benefit from a well-organized, competent enterprise development department that will initially concentrate on the creation of tourism-related public enterprises, the development of PPP and intergovernmental partnership tourism projects, and the mobilization/generation of resources for investments in tourism ventures that bring in revenue.

**Presence of a wide range of business opportunities.** Also, there was the enactment of RA 7718, or the Build-Operate and Transfer (BOT) law that provides more focus on the PPP which gives more opportunity to both local and foreign investments. In addition, the BARMM, being an autonomous government, could also create bills relevant to the boosting and surge of investments in the region.

## Priority Challenges to be Addressed in 2023-2028

### Agriculture, Fisheries, Agrarian Reform

One of the key challenges to be addressed in 2023-2028 is **low agriculture and fisheries productivity**. This is associated with:

**High production cost.** High production cost is due to several factors. These include the high cost of farm inputs (fertilizers, seeds, and labor); limited access to credit; and limited mechanization, among others. Other critically important factors include the limited technical and managerial capacity of farmers; inadequate agriculture infrastructure support, particularly irrigation facilities for rice; soil fertility and water management; and inadequately funded extension services and programs of government.

**High cost of post-production and marketing and high retail price.** High transportation and high fuel costs are among the biggest post-production costs. However, it is not only fuel cost that contributes to high transportation cost; the poor infrastructure facilities that include road network from FMRs; lack of consolidation and processing centers leading to high consolidation and logistics costs; and lack of milling facilities and power interruption leading to high milling cost.

High retail price is a direct threat to food security because while farmers retain a portion of their harvest for their own consumption, many of the poor will have to buy rice at high retail price. Though BARMM is considered self-sufficient in terms of rice production, some of the rice produced in the region are not consumed in the region.

- **Weak extension services.** This challenge is brought on by the inadequate manufacturing/reproduction of appropriate IEC materials for distribution and the sparse deployment of Agricultural Extension Workers (AEW) at the provincial/municipal level.

- **Low technology generated for commercialization.** Insufficient capacity building for R&D workers and a dearth of approved plantilla positions for research results in a lack of specialization and lack of a research strategy, both of which will weaken collaborations with academic institutions. This problem is also accounted for by a lack of research-related facilities and insufficient funding for R&D.

- **Weak agricultural regulation.** This is related to weak implementation of regulatory issuances, lack of pest and disease diagnostic, forecasting, and early warning, weak strategy for revenue generation, and limited monitoring and support to agricultural products.

- **Lack of highly reliable, prompt, and accurate agri-fishery laboratory test results, confirmatory diagnosis, and production and animal health recommendations.** This is related to the lack of logistics for laboratory activities and extension services, weak linkage with other regional and national laboratories, insufficient conduct of laboratory analyses, lack of laboratory facilities, machines, and equipment, and lack of agri-fishery laboratory database.

- **Coastal ecosystem degradation.** The coastal ecosystem is crucial for fisheries. This includes coral reefs, beds of submerged aquatic vegetation, and mangrove forests. Factors influencing its degradation are inappropriate utilization of inorganic fertilizer in seaweed farming, lack of a mechanism to sustain marine protected areas, weak participation of communities in coastal resource management, illegal cuttings, and conversion of mangrove areas into the fishpond, poor information dissemination, weak regulatory data and system support, and the lack of water delineation law.

- **Limited aquaculture and capture fisheries development intervention.** Currently, there is no established Mariculture Park that supports services for processing, transport, and marketing and an anchoring system for floating fish cages, fish landings, cold storage, etc. There is also a lack of supply of hatchery-bred fingerlings and formulated feed. Capacity building for fisherfolks is limited, and infrastructures, hatcheries and breeding stations are insufficient.

- **Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.** This is attributed to weak enforcement of fishery laws, weak coordination with LGUs and law enforcement agencies, limited staff capacity building, insufficient Monitoring Control and Surveillance Floating Assets, and lack of an Integrated Marine Environment Monitoring System (IMEMS).

- **Low competitiveness in farming and fishing.** "The average age of the Filipino farmer is 57. Assuming an average life span of 70, we might reach a critical [shortage] of farmers in just 15 years." Due to a lack of access to land and funding as well as the fact that farming and fishing require a lot of labor and pay little, the younger generation lacks enthusiasm in engaging in these activities. Young farmers and fishermen have little access to support, opportunities, and creative programs, and there is a lack of information on the advantages of farming and fishing. The insufficient absorption capacity of farmers and fishermen, as well as limited access to loans and agri-fishery insurance, are further contributing elements to this dilemma.

- **Weak monitoring & evaluation.** This is due to the lack of a database system for a list of beneficiaries, a lack of modern technology in reporting and M&E, a shortage of technical staff with the necessary skills, and a lack of M&E tools.

The second key challenge to be addressed within 2023-2028 is the **intergenerational tenancy among farmers and inequitable land distribution**. This is associated with:

- **Stringent and lengthy procedures of land ownership.** Sensitivity of the beneficiary identification process, strict requirements for processing and acquiring lands, time-consuming technical procedures for cancellation and transfer actions, loss of control over the awarded lands due to leases and sales to financial actors, intermediaries, and landlords, the presence of inaccurate information and inadequate cooperation from concerned landowners, and poor implementation of a properly documented tenancy agreement/leasehold program are the factors that contribute to this issue.

- **Conflicts over land tenure and ownership**, which are common in BARMM, are another important element and the primary reason that rido or clan feuds break out.

The third core problem to be addressed under this sub-sector is the **High food insecurity of households at 44.5 percent in 2019**. This is caused by:

- **High post-harvest losses.** Poor FMR identification and implementation, insufficient financial support for post- and pre-harvest infrastructure, and a lack of information or an inventory of pre- and post-harvest facilities are some of the factors contributing to this problem. Due to this, farmers and organizations perform poorly, and old-fashioned post-harvest methods are still employed. Convergence among agencies is needed to have a responsive program.

- **High vulnerability to disaster.** This includes damages due to emerging pests and diseases which results in significant output losses.

- **Weak partnerships with private sectors and industry players.** Value chain analysis is crucial for identifying elements that either increase or decrease a market's efficiency. Lack of a food security council or outdated established councils as a result of the merger of agencies into one ministry, such as the Agrarian Reform Council and Agri fishery Council, the existence of a weak or limited aggregation system for smallholders, an outdated industrial plan, a lack of legislation governing the establishment of government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs) in BARMM and the absence of any GOCC, as well as the lack of an entrepreneurial mindset and functional ability among farmers and fishers contributes to this challenge.

- **Limited opportunity for market linkages activities.** This includes unorganized value chain linkages, insufficient funding for food product development and processing, and inadequate marketing expertise among farmers and fishermen. Limited support for Halal and organic production program, lack of transportation tools, a lack of mechanisms for inclusive funding for farmers and fishermen, and restricted access to domestic and international markets are all included.

### Trade and Industry

A core problem that needs to be addressed in 2023-2028 under trade and industry is the **low competitiveness and sustainability of MSMEs and industries**. This is mainly caused by the following:

- **Mismatch in skills and available resources.** The mismatch between the skill sets that the region's sectors require, and the skill training offered to the potential pool of workers represents a broader gap in vocational skill training. The majority of these resources are therefore not being fully utilized.

- **Technical competency of small entrepreneurs and industry players to maximize their resources is outdated to a no-zero-competency level.** The factors contributing to this challenge are the literacy and awareness of the community in the existing and available government programs. To cite an example, the information on the zero-waste management program in the coconut industry is not completely cascaded to the farmers to enable them to enjoy the maximum productivity potentials of the by-products of coconut. Further, certifications, licenses, registrations, permits, and other business operation processes are costly.

- **Limited access to production and processing facilities.** Compliance with product standards requires a large amount of capitalization more so that it needs facilities and equipment for the production and processing of value-added commodities. Hence, the absence of these facilities resulted in a limited number of competitive and standard-compliant products and services. Taking into account the economic status of the regions' MSMEs, these necessities remain a challenge.

- **Limited access to credit facilities by the MSMEs, farmers, and fisherfolks.** Only highly capitalized organizations and firms with long credit histories have access to formal financing institutions. Most MSMEs, farmers, and fisherfolks resort to an informal credit system that bears the high cost of borrowing.

- **Limited connectivity.** Connectivity in terms of mobile networks and telecommunication is a major challenge in Bangsamoro. Perhaps, the same could be said in other regions of the country; however, it is much more apparent in peripheral areas of Bangsamoro. In urban centers such as Cotabato City and other communities in the provinces, internet connectivity is heavily dependent on the signal of mobile networks. In many instances, particularly in BaSulTa areas, mobile signal is not even felt. This poor connectivity tremendously impacts the development of the local economy, thus, impeding the implementation of digital marketing and cashless transactions throughout the region.

### Investments

A core problem that needs to be addressed under this sub-sector within 2023-2028 is the **limited private investments in BARMM**. This is mainly due to the following:

- **Low business confidence.** There is a low or negative impression among investors in relation to BARMM as an investment destination. This is mainly brought by peace and order issues, limited infrastructure, poor connectivity, as well as inadequate logistic facilities, and an unstable political and policy landscape.

- **Underdeveloped Halal products and services.** The government has been pushing time and again for the promotion of halal products and services. However, the government failed to focus on the development and sustenance of the production of halal products for domestic and export markets. Halal industry development must be one of the identified priority areas under economic development.

- **High cost of utilities.** The high cost of utilities and other logistics needed for the operation of the business contributes to an "unfriendly" business environment, thus, a major challenge to start-up enterprises.

- **Weak linkages of the BARMM with the BIMP-EAGA economic integration (e.g., Halal industry and revival of barter trading).** The issue of weak linkages of the region with the BIMP EAGA market can be attributed to Limited number of infra-connectivity projects. Connecting the region to the international market through the expansion of roads and communication infrastructures will address the gap on connectivity; Limited number of standard-compliant production and processing facilities, Limited trading engagement on the international and inter-regional markets, Limited number of Halal-certified products and services; and Lack of Techno-Business Incubator.

- **Lack of industry roadmap.** The BARMM has yet to formulate its investment roadmap. On the part of the MTIT, the BOI will lead in the formulation of an investment roadmap and framework that will detail the current investment situation and outline the various interventions needed to promote the region as an investment destination of choice by investors.

  The Bangsamoro Investment Roadmap Framework will serve as a structured management tool for planning, forecasting, and promotion of investments and as a basis for effecting policies and implementing programs that will support the development and growth of investments including funding for strategic promotion activities, industry development, policy research, value proposition, and facilitation services.

- **Poor implementation of the ease of doing a business act.** Another reason for the low level of investments in the region is the poor implementation of the Ease of Doing Business and Effective Government Service Delivery Act of 2018 or RA 11032 in the BARMM, particularly in digitalizing government transactions.

- **Inadequate data/information on investment opportunities.** The inadequacy of data/information complementing the investment opportunities in the region such as Investment Development Plans, CLUP, LGU development plan, the potential areas for investment (land area), ease of doing business, clean land title, areas abundant of raw materials and the like contributed to the lack of information of investors on what the BARMM can offer. Investors just became satisfied with their establishment in other places because there is no sufficient data/information showcasing the region as an investment-friendly destination.

### Tourism

The fourth core problem under this sub-sector is the **underdeveloped tourism circuits in the region**.

- **Underdeveloped tourism circuits.** There are no established tourism circuits in the region. Tourism products in Bangsamoro are limited to nature tourism and beaches. While there exist many tourist destinations, a vast majority of them are still potential sites, with no existing support amenities, facilities, and tourism circuits to provide a complete tourist experience.

  Existing tourism assets are also generally underdeveloped or developing. For those already open for tourists, many are accessible only to local visitors coming from within Bangsamoro and neighboring regions.

  There are few tourism-related enterprises operating in the region. The majority of these are concentrated in urban centers and identified growth areas. In the mainland, hotels and accommodation facilities, as well as transport services are concentrated in Cotabato City.

  In Marawi City, a limited number of accommodations are observed in Marawi Resort, an academe-operated facility being the prime lodging option. In BaSulTa, there are no hotels, but a number of inns and resorts are available for accommodations; beach resorts however are very common.

### Ecozone Development and Freeport

A key problem to be addressed within 2023-2028 under this sub-sector is the **limited expansion of economic opportunities in industry and services**.

- **Low number of ecozone enterprises/locators registered.** The number of ecozone enterprises/locators registered has gone low due to a lot of factors. Among these are the limited number of market promotions and linkages, unimplemented program for market promotion and linkages, limited freeport and ecozone public and private engagements for investment promotion, and absence of policy that will institutionalize the operations of the economic zone. Moreover, there was no inclusion of the Investment Promotion Agency (IPA) that took place. There was also a poor coordination mechanism between the national and local government, limited data on inbound and outbound cargoes for local and international vessels, a lack of financial data of port users, no digitized revenue collections and operations systems, and a lack of skilled personnel to manage the digitized system.

- **Underdeveloped freeports and ecozones.** There were limited studies to support freeport and ecozone development. There's also a lack of Ecozone Roadmap. Moreover, there was a limited number of skilled personnel in the following: port management, maritime security, port health and safety, ecozone technical planning, tax incentives under the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (CREATE) Act, and port environment compliance. There were also unfilled permanent positions at BEZA and Polloc Freeport and Economic Zone-BARMM (PFEZ-BARMM), and most of the current employees were employed through a contract of service.

  Lamitan City offers tremendous potential for barter trading. Hence, it is imperative that a seaport be expanded in order to accommodate large sea vessels for the export of regional goods.

- **Inadequate infrastructures to support improvements required in ecozone and freeport standards.** Currently, the regional ecozone and freeport don't have modernized equipment for operations. There are unfunded wharf extensions that are essential to the operations and inadequate capital investment in infrastructures, freeport, and ecozone development. Moreover, there is no Relocation Action Plan for informal settlers in order to maximize the potential of the ecozone areas.

- **Lack of reformed freeports and ecozone policies.** There is an absence of manual operations and reformed freeports and ecozone policies that will govern and strengthen the operations of the freeport and ecozone to cover rules, and tariff rates applicable for and granting of fiscal incentives, and environmental standards imposed on freeports and ecozones. Further, the BEZA Law is yet to be established.

- **Limited number of ecozones developed.** The development of economic zones in BARMM has been one of the strategies to stimulate the economic activities and growth of the region. However, the region has still no Ecozone Development Plan that will serve as a blueprint for the development of the economic zone in the BARMM. Likewise, the required infrastructure to reinforce the industrial agglomeration in the Bangsamoro area may not be on hand. For instance, the Bangsamoro region's road density (0.10) remains the lowest in the country which is not even half of the national average (0.25). The issues on the access to electricity and water supply of the proposed ecozones to be established are yet to be addressed by the Bangsamoro Government. It cannot be overemphasized that the creation of ecozones itself does not guarantee an increase in investments, rather, the development of infrastructure facilities is the key to enhancing the investment climate in the region.

  The PFEZ-BARMM is the only existing ecozone in the region. A Final Master Plan and Feasibility Study Report was issued to PFEZ-BARMM last October 2018 that focused on addressing its port services development. The Bangsamoro region still suffers from inadequate infrastructure due to the low capital investments granted for industrial development. As a result, the ecozone generates low revenue collection for the period 2019-2021.

### Cooperatives and Social Enterprise

A key problem to be addressed under this sub-sector is the **low functionality and unsustainable profitability of cooperatives**. This is mainly due to the following:

- **Low compliance rate.** Only 11.66 percent of registered cooperatives were able to secure their certificate of compliance with the requirements set by the law. With the new proposed targets set by the sector for cooperative and social enterprise — raising the number of compliances up to 50 percent will serve as the priority challenge for the cooperative and social enterprise sub-sector.

- **Lack of enacted Code relevant to cooperative and social enterprises.** The pending codification of the Cooperative Code and Social Enterprise Code currently slows down the full operationalization and institutionalization of both Cooperatives and SE. However, the recent development of its crafting shows great potential for Bangsamoro Cooperatives and Social Enterprises (BCSE) as it went through an extensive consultation to create a code uniquely for the Bangsamoro.

- **Inadequate participation of LGUs in matters relating to cooperatives and social enterprises.** Active participation of LGUs through the inclusion of cooperative and social enterprise development in their Local Government Development plan as well as the appointment of Municipal Cooperative Officers (MCOs) will pave a way for better operationalization of cooperatives and social enterprises. However, as of now, most LGUs in the Bangsamoro Region had no appointed MCOs. Hence, regional cooperative officers find it difficult to coordinate at the LGU level. In addition, to address this issue, the establishment of provincial extension offices of CSEA is necessary.

### Labor and Employment

A key problem to be addressed under this sub-sector within the period 2023-2028 is the **lack of decent employment (insufficient employment opportunities and low-quality jobs)**. This is primarily caused by inadequate labor supply and low labor demand.

**Inadequate labor supply is mainly caused by:**

- **Insufficient number of skilled workers.** This is caused by high/increased out-migration for work and the departure of professionals and non-professionals to seek better opportunities.

- **Increased and continuing vulnerability to trafficking, forced labor, and abusive labor conditions of overseas and local workers.** This is caused by poor terms of employment and working conditions, lack of decent work and a high degree of informality, continuous operation of unscrupulous private recruitment agencies, and inability to secure work and work experience.

- **Low skilled and inexperienced human resources with low productivity (job-skills mismatch).** This is mainly due to a lack of core employability skills, which is caused by limited access to quality education and training, a high number of dropouts, and low enrolment in vocational courses.

- **Limited and/or lack of access to decent work opportunities.** This is mainly caused by a lack of knowledge and awareness of decent work opportunities and a weak infrastructure system to support access to employment/investments.

**Low labor demand** can be explained by an insufficient number of industries/companies and limited public and private labor-intensive investments.

A policy that will not only address the Halal food industry development but the entire halal ecosystem from production, promotion, trade regulation, certification and research and development, among others.

With this, it is the avowed policy of the Bangsamoro government through the MTIT to introduce new strategies to enhance productivity and job generation to uplift the economic condition of the people of BARMM. One of the economic strategies launched by the Bangsamoro government is the promotion of Halal industries which is geared towards the strengthening of the agri-business sector to respond to the emerging need for Halal products and services. To sustain this economic drive, a host of requirements must be laid out. One of these is the need for a Halal Industry Development Plan to be formulated and implemented.

The plan will serve as the directional chart of BARMM's flagship economic thrust as it takes on the various industry challenges ahead. This will also enable a more focused effort and a more judicious allocation of resources for the regional government. Also, it would enable a more defined direction for the various stakeholders of the industry. This program consists of three projects namely: (1) Formulation of Halal Industry Development Plan; (2) Development of Halal Accreditation Guidelines; and (3) Halal Accreditation.

Thus, by promoting regulations to support policies, guidelines, rules, and regulations help to access a sustainable port trading.

The program provides a quality service to the port users and become a competitive port destination upon complete realization. With the issuance of International Ship and Port facility Security (ISPS Code), ensures that the freeport and ecozone is fully secured and safe for local and international vessels to dock. The port is an agile industry that needs immediate intervention due to fast pacing of modern technology and new infrastructure innovations. The modernization and development program immerse into a competitive port not only in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region but be known internationally.

## Priority Policy and Legislative Agenda

**Bangsamoro Regional Crop Protection Center (RCPC).** The RCPC shall ensure proper and timely crop pest management actions through proactive pest identification, risk assessment, monitoring, surveillance, predicting occurrences, management, and control, including the identification, isolation, culture, and mass production of natural pest enemies.

**Institutionalization of Bangsamoro Agri-Fishery Training Institute (BAFTI).** The BAFTI shall be responsible for the training of all Agri-Fishery extension workers, farmers, fisherfolks, and ARBs and including the incorporation and extension of the matured technologies from the research and development to the target clientele through appropriate training and extension activities, to support increased productivity in agriculture and fisheries.

**Bangsamoro Crops Research Institute (BCRI).** The research institute is tasked to undertake rice, corn, and high-value crop research programs for the BARMM.

**Institutionalization of the Farmer and Fisherfolks Enterprise Development Program.** The institutionalization will ensure the sustainability and increase in agriculture and fisheries access to markets and services and strengthen access of farmers, fisherfolks, and agrarian reform beneficiaries to capital insurance, loans/grants, resources, and equipment through a value chain approach.

**Bangsamoro Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (BFPA).** The BFPA will be responsible for the regulation of the supply of fertilizer and pesticides, rationalizing the manufacturer and marketing of fertilizer and pesticide to protect the public from risks by using the pesticides and awareness of the agriculture and fisheries sector in the application of these inputs. Also, responsible for the regulation and issuance of the permit to operate for the fertilizer and pesticide distributor in the Bangsamoro region.

**Amendment and adoption of applicable BFAR Fisheries Administrative Order based on the MAFAR structure.** The Fisheries Services is mandated to formulate fisheries standardized research, guidelines, policies, and procedures. Hence, the Bangsamoro Fisheries Administrative Order (BFAO) shall be created for the purpose of implementing its service mandate and to provide an effective direction in carrying out its functions which can be of effective help in ensuring the success of its implementation and objectives, pursuant to the MAFAR Structures. This serves as a guide for our regional fisheries operations and guides the implementation of the fisheries program and initiatives as a means of fostering the livelihood of our fisherfolks.

**Regional Fisheries Law Enforcement Council (RFLEC).** The law enforcement is part and partial of the operation of fisheries programs and activities to ensure efficient and effective enforcement of fishery laws, rules, and regulations. This is also providing standard operation procedures for law enforcement officers and other law enforcement partners like the coastguard, PNP, and others.

**Fisheries Adjudication Board (FAB).** The fisheries adjudication board serves as the ministry committee with sole authority to adjudicate related fishery cases in tandem with the created hearing officers of the ministry to investigate.

**Bay-wide Management Council (BMC).** The institutionalization of this Council will address the sub-sectoral objectives of improving food resiliency, climate change adaptation, and resource management in the fishery. The policy will strengthen the fishery resources management, protection, and conservation of our coastal resources to maintain the fish stocks and their environs. The Council will serve as a body that will provide technical advisory, recommendatory, and guidelines on the proper implementation of coastal fishery resources.

**Local Government Tourism Code (LGTC).** This will help facilitate boosting and harnessing the promising tourism economic potentials of our region. This will greatly help the provincial/city/municipal LGUs in developing and managing the local tourism assets.

**Bangsamoro Investments Code.** The code aims to establish the BBOI on a "more stable footing". It shall provide uniform fiscal incentives to investors for all the investment promotion agencies in the country, including the BBOI. This policy intends to help the achievement of sub-sector objectives on increasing investment generation in BARMM and will address key issue of limited private investments in BARMM.

**Application of PPP in the LGUs.** Equally important is the institutionalization of policy that hopes to make the PPP as one of the economic opportunities that will undoubtedly espouse context-based economic activities in harmony with the thrust of the LGUs.

**Inter-Ministry Committee on Investment.** The establishment of an inter-ministry mechanism tasked to champion investment-related programs and or initiatives in both soft packages and hard infrastructure will fire up an unprecedented high trend in investment relocation across the region.

**Establishment of Ease of Doing Business (ARTA).** This policy will help intensify the implementation of the Ease of Doing Business Act in BARMM (RA 11032), which streamlines the procedures in the processing of applications, through the established Business One Stop Shop (BOSS).

### Ecozone and Freeport Services

**Bangsamoro Economic Zone Authority (BEZA) Law.** BEZA an attached agency of the MTIT was created by virtue of RA 11054 and the Chapter 6 of the BAA 13, highlights the creation of BEZA and sets forth therein the creation of economic zones and freeports within the BARMM, as well as the general powers and functions of BEZA and its Executive Director.

The BOL and the BAA 13 are not sufficient to administer incentives and oversee economic zones and freeports within BARMM considering that the relevant provisions thereof merely authorize or empower the Bangsamoro government through its Bangsamoro Parliament to create BEZA and economic zones within the BARMM. It is, therefore, necessary to have a separate law clearly establishing BEZA and stating its functions and scope of authority, including the power to grant incentives as well as the incentives that may be granted, within the limits and bounds of the CREATE Act and other applicable laws.

**Crafting of Polloc Freeport and Economic Zone-BARMM Charter.** The PFEZ exist by virtue of the MMA Act 153 and Proclamation 01, dated 2010. It must have a charter to define the structure and function as an autonomous port. The freeport and ecozone should establish clear policies, rules, and regulations on the port operation and development.

# Chapter 8: Harnessing technology and innovations to increase socioeconomic opportunities and improve government services

## Science, Technology, and Innovation

**Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI)** is considered as a key driver in growth and development, specifically in the fields of agriculture, fisheries, and industry. STI is increasingly considered as central to the transition to inclusive, sustainable, and resilient development in both developing and developed countries. In recognition to this, the PDP 2017-2022 made STI the foundation or the 0-10 Point Socioeconomic Agenda of the Duterte Administration with a vision of raising the country towards becoming an innovative and knowledge-driven economy. STI is among the thrusts of the BOL that mandates the Bangsamoro government to strengthen regional programs for science, technology, and innovation. Currently, the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) serves as the lead ministry in promoting, advocating, and developing science and technology-based initiatives.

## Sectoral Assessment

### Weak STI Ecosystem and Governance

There are two (2) higher education institutions (HEIs) in the region that offer science and technology-related courses: the Mindanao State University and the Cotabato Foundation College of Science and Technology. Institutions that would translate the result of research activities into marketable products are lacking within BARMM. There is also no BARMM Science Park, which can serve as the hub of research and technology-based enterprises to transform R&D results into products, processes, and services for commercialization. The institutions that would facilitate connecting business enterprises, start-ups, and venture capitalists in the region are lacking. As of August 2021, there are only 1,340 registered business establishments in the region engaged in manufacturing. This figure only accounts for 0.6 percent of the total registered in the country.

### Weak STI Culture

The low scientific literacy and weak STI culture is one of the greatest challenges in the region. Based on the result of a survey conducted by the Social Weather Station in 2013, the Philippines had only 3.20% scientific literacy compared to Australia (17%) and China (6.5%). The weak STI culture among households leads to the low utilization of new technologies and lack of interest in pursuing science and technology courses.

### Weak Access to Science and Technology Laboratory Facilities

The scientific-based laboratory that could support student learners and researchers with scientific facilities is lacking in the region. Currently, the Bangsamoro Science High School Technology Laboratory (BSHTL), which is a unit under MOST, operates only one science laboratory facility located in Cotabato City. This laboratory is the only service laboratory conducting scientific-based analysis in the region, which primarily performs testing, calibration, and other metrology services and provides technical consultancy services to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME).

### Weak Research and Development (R&D) Support

Despite the presence of research universities in the region, the capability of researchers is weak due to limited budget and research facilities. Based on the NSO data, only 1.10% of the budget in HEIs is allocated for research, and also it only constitutes 0.23% of the region's GRDP in 2019. In the case of SUCs and HEIs, allocations for research, development, and extension are comparatively low. Many local companies are not engaged in R&D activities. The result of R&D activities conducted in the region is not translated into products and services due to the absence of technology business incubators and science parks.

## Opportunities

### The Bangsamoro Autonomous Scholarship for Excellence (BASE) Scholarship

The BASE Scholarship grant offers free higher education to all Bangsamoro people. This is a big opportunity for the graduates of science high schools to take up science and technology courses.

### The Bangsamoro Science High School Technology Laboratory (BSHTL)

There is an ongoing plan of MOST to transform the BSHTL into the BARMM Regional Science High School. Once completed, it will be a big opportunity to increase the number of science and technology course takers from the region.

### The BARMM R&D Agenda and Halal Research Program

The MOST has already developed the Research and Development Agenda for 2020-2025, which serves as the region's policy direction on R&D to address the needs and demands of the industries, communities, and the region in general.

### BARMM Health Research Consortium

The MOH-BARMM, the Mindanao State University (MSU) Marawi and AMAI Pakpak Medical Center (AMPMC), established a health research consortium in the region. Their goal is to establish an appropriate health research system in BARMM and develop the research capability of health workers. This opportunity will support the region in achieving its goal of building sustainable science, technology, and innovation ecosystem.

## Priority Challenges for 2023-2028

1. Low appreciation on the role of science, technology, and innovation in national development
2. Low investment in research and development
3. Weak STI governance
4. Low absorptive capacity of industries

# Chapter 9: Ensuring inclusive and equitable access to quality services for social justice and human capital development

Section 19, Article XII of RA 11054 provides, among others, that the Parliament shall assign the highest budgetary priority to education, health, and social services as may be provided in its appropriation law.

This chapter covers the social development sector that includes the subsectors of education, health, nutrition and sanitation, and social welfare, giving emphasis of the agenda numbers 7 and 9 of the Enhanced 12-Point Priority Agenda of the BARMM.

This chapter aims to contribute to Agenda No. 2 of the 8-Point Socioeconomic Agenda of the Marcos Administration, and SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10.

This explains the current situation of the social sector and its subsectors, opportunities, and priority challenges. The sectoral framework underscores the desired goal and objectives provided to help achieve the region's overall goal. Corresponding strategies supported by priority intervention are identified to serve as a guide within the planning period.

## Sectoral Assessment

### Sectoral Trends

The education system and structure in the BARMM is different from other regions of the country as it combines the four sectors of basic, higher, technical, and Madaris educations. Each sector has specific level and field of education and learning but all lodged to the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Educations (MBHTE) based on BAA 13 or the Administrative Code of the BARMM.

#### BARMM lags behind in basic education performance

The BARMM is ranked lowest in functional literacy rate based on 2019 data from PSA as it recorded only 71.0 percent compared to 96.5 percent of the National Capital Region (NCR). It is attributed to high dropout rate in Grades 1 to 6 in the region. For the junior and senior high or Grades 7 to 12, BARMM is ranked number 3. In terms of cohort survival rate, the BARMM is ranked the lowest having 64.75 percent compared to Region II with highest rate at 97.89 percent. For Grades 7 to 12, the BARMM is ranked as the third lowest having 56.66 percent compared to NCR with the highest rate at 92.86 percent.

Moreover, the completion rate for Grades 1 to 6, the BARMM is ranked the lowest with 63.98 percent, far from the highest region with 98.56 percent. For Grades 7 to 12, the BARMM is ranked the third lowest with 56.89 percent compared to highest region with 90.36 percent.

This can be attributed to the prevalence of poverty leaving children with no choice but to help in the family needs, and decades old armed conflict in the region causing displacement and uncertainty. Low level of education limits income-earning opportunities like landing a stable job or opening businesses, which resulted to low family income and cyclical poverty incidence. This also increases the likelihood of becoming children at risk and children in conflict with the law.

**Table 9.1 Basic Education Performance**

| Indicator | BARMM | Philippines | Highest Region Rate | Rank/Rate |
|-----------|-------|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Functional Literacy Rate | 71.6 | 91.6 | 96.5% | Lowest among regions (PSA 2019) |
| Dropout Rate for Grade 1 to Grade 7 | 8.36 | 3.76 | 0.39% | Highest among regions |
| Dropout Rate for Grade 7 to 12 | 10.14 | 6.64 | 1.65% | 3rd highest after NCR and Region V |
| Cohort Survival Rate for Grades 1 to 6 | 64.75 | 83.02 | 98.89% | Lowest among regions |
| Cohort Survival Rate for Grades 7 to 12 | 58.66 | 71.30 | 92.46% | 3rd lowest after NCR and Region V |
| Completion Rate for Grade 1 to 6 | 63.98 | 82.51 | 98.56% | Lowest among regions |
| Completion Rate for Grade 7 to 12 | 56.89 | 69.32 | 90.36% | 3rd lowest after NCR and Region V |

#### Limited education personnel and facilities remain a challenge

The standard ratio of teacher to student are 1:50 for kindergarten, 1:35 for Grades 1 to 3, and 1:40 for Grades 4 to 12. Table 9.2 shows that there is a shortage of teachers in Grades 1 to 3 and Grades 4 to 12. It is worth noting that although the data shows no problem on the ratio of teacher to pupil in Kindergarten, the issue on the deployment of teachers particularly in the far-flung barangays, coupled with the tardiness, and absenteeism of some teachers, substantially affected the quality of education in the BARMM.

According to the joint study of the World Bank and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) in 2014, the negative impact on the effectiveness and quality of education in the region can also be attributed to the widespread teacher absences and the management of the issue. In a survey conducted in Lanao del Sur, a significant 31.0 percent was confirmed as absent, which indicates a combination of the so-called "ghost teachers" reported as school personnel and actual absences.

The study further noted that the absences of teachers are prevalent in the provincial or rural schools than in the urban schools as verified with the Lanao del Sur survey but may vary across provinces. It was likewise known that male teachers (39 percent) were more likely to be absent than female teachers (30 percent). The school principal was found to have the highest absence rates.

**Table 9.2 Actual Teacher-Student Ratio from Kindergarten to Senior High School, SY 2019-2020**

| Grade Level | Standard | Actual Teacher-Student Ratio |
|-------------|----------|------------------------------|
| Kindergarten | 1:50 | 1:26 |
| Grade 1-3 | 1:35 | 1:38 |
| Grade 4-12 | 1:40 | 1:42 |

*Source: EBEIS*

As of school year 2020-2021, the BARMM has 2,595 total number of schools with 913,456 learners, 27,885 teachers, and 28,759 classrooms. Among the school divisions, Sulu with 448 schools has the highest total number of schools with 142,413 learners, 4,006 teachers, and 4,186 classrooms. This comprises the whole province unlike Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur with two divisions each.

**Table 9.3 Summary of Learners, Teachers, and Classrooms per Division, SY 2021-2022**

#### Unserved and school-less barangays in BARMM

There are about 104 unserved and underserved barangays of basic education out of the 2,590 barangays in the BARMM. With affirmative action taken by the MBHTE through its Abot Kaalaman sa Pamilyang Bangsamoro Program (AKAP Program), 106 of these barangays are now provided with early years education via Alternative Delivery Mode (ADM).

Among the barangays reached by the AKAP are the geographically isolated, marginalized, and indigenous communities of Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur and island barangays in BaSulTa. Strategies for delivering education access to the remaining school-less barangays are also being implemented through ADM and other Flexible Learning Options (FLOs). Some of the ADM learning centers are also gradually transitioning into primary public schools.

#### Inadequate assistance to Madaris Education

Unique to the Bangsamoro education system is the presence of Madaris education. It also serves as avenue of preserving beliefs, culture, and identity of the Bangsamoro. Currently, out of 1,679 existing Madaris in the BARMM, only 117 are accredited and enjoying support from the Bangsamoro government. This is due to non-fulfillment of requirements necessary for accreditation. Thus, there is a need to provide support to those not yet accredited to comply with the requirements. Still, enhancement of the existing Madaris curriculum is necessary to keep abreast with societal demands.

**Figure 9.1 Accredited vs. Traditional Madrasah, SY 2021-2022**

*[Pie Chart showing: 1,679 Traditional Madrasah (93%) vs. 117 Accredited Madrasah (7%)]*

*Source: MBHTE-DGME*

Part of the regulatory function of the Directorate General for Madaris Education (DGME) is to assess, monitor, and validate the operation of the madrasahs across the region. Aside from the 117 existing accredited madrasahs in BARMM, a total of 243 madrasahs were inspected and found compliant with the minimum requirement set by the MBHTE and provided with Permit to Operate.

**Figure 9.2 Madrasah with Permit to Operate**

#### Low Assessment Rate in Technical Education

Private enterprises are investing in the opening of Technical-Vocational Education and Training (TVET) programs. But the same investment is slowing down in the establishment of accredited assessment centers.

Sixty percent or 15,002 people of the total 25,002 completers/graduates have undergone the National Competency Assessment, with 94 percent or 14,036 people certified as competent.

Graduating students from With Training Regulation (WTR) registered programs must complete mandatory assessments. Private Technical Vocational Institutions (TVIs) designated as assessment venues may conduct assessments in their facilities. Out of the 25,002 completers/graduates, there are 18,193 graduates who took the competency assessment tools (CATs), with 7,465 undergoing assessments for certification, registering a 41.03 percent assessment rate.

The low assessment rate can be attributed to the BARMM's limited number of competency assessment centers and the TESDA representatives who oversee the competency assessment process. The increase in plantilla positions from 71.0 percent during ARMM to 96.0 percent in 2021 is expected to address the long-standing issue of a lack of TESDA representatives during competency assessment.

#### Limited access to higher education

Currently, the Bangsamoro has only 16 State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) and 110 private Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) operating in the region. The SUCs can help the Bangsamoro in providing affordable, inclusive, and equitable access to quality higher education. However, these institutions have been established many decades before the creation of the Bangsamoro government. Hence, there is a need to upgrade these SUCs to make them competitive with other SUCs in the country.

### Health

**Health outcomes remain challenging.** The health outcomes in the Bangsamoro region are lagging behind due to limited access to quality health services. Although there has been some progress in the overall healthcare system, however, these issues remain prevalent. Among these issues were low outcome on immunization including COVID-19 vaccination and child health; insufficient support to adolescent and women's health, psychosocial and mental health; limited access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene services; low coverage of social protection and health insurance; prevalence of malnutrition and inadequate dietary intake; worsened structural and non-structural issues on human resources; results-based financing and perpetuating supply chain data and information management, and monitoring and evaluation. These issues were exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

A perpetual issue not only in BARMM, is limited access to professional health care services due to insufficient skilled health care personnel and well-equipped health facilities at the regional and local levels. This is caused by the issue of difficulty of transportation especially in the far-flung areas and worsened by the absence of clear policy guidelines on shared responsibility in the delivery of health care services. Behavioral change remains as an issue as it requires internal motivation to practice health-seeking behavior. It requires the whole community to influence someone get motivated and practice good health seeking behavior.

**Birth and death.** In the Bangsamoro region, the annual number of live births per 1,000 population declined from 20.78 percent in 2015 to 16.7 percent in 2020. Similarly, reduction in the number of deaths in the same period was also observed from 1.59 percent in 2015 to 1.2 percent in 2020.

**Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR).** MMR in Bangsamoro was lowest in 2018 at 42.35 percent within the 2015-2020 period. However, it started to increase again in 2019. In 2020, BARMM's MMR was at 73.83 percent and was able to surpass the national average of 70.66 percent. Delays in seeking medical care and limited access to health services were among the primary causes of this upward trend.

**Ratio of physicians to population.** Table 9.4 shows that there is a shortage of physicians in the BARMM, specifically in the provinces of Maguindanao, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi and the city of Marawi. In addition, difficulty of transportation and issue of peace and order in some areas hamper health personnel from delivering health care services.

**Table 9.4 Ratio of Public Physicians to Population in the BARMM, 2021**

**Ratio of public nurse to population.** In the case of public nurses, the standard ratio is 1:20,000. Based on Table 9.5, there is no shortage of public nurses in the BARMM. However, the difficulty of transportation, added with the issues of punctuality and limited support of some LGUs, hinder the delivery of health care services particularly in the far-flung areas.

**Table 9.5 Current Ratio of Public Nurse to Population, 2021**

In the case of midwives, the standard ratio of the public midwives to the population in the BARMM is 1:5,000. Table 9.6 shows that there is no shortage of midwives in the BARMM except in the province of Sulu and Marawi City, wherein the current actual ratio is 1:5,536 and 1:5,822 respectively, which is greater than 1:5,000 standard. However, the issues of deployment, punctuality, and difficulty of transportation hamper the delivery of health care services.

**Health care facilities.** The health care facilities in the region have significantly increased in number, but with the increasing number of population, health care facilities remain significantly below the standard ratio.

Based on the World Bank Service Availability and Readiness Assessment in 2019, the region needs to increase the Rural Health Units (RHUs) by about 50 percent to meet the national standard of one RHU per 20,000 people. The same is needed with other necessary health facilities. As of 2021, only 117 out of 2,590 barangays of BARMM have Barangay Health Stations (BHS).

**Table 9.7 Health Care Facilities of BARMM, 2021**

There is still shortage of hospital bed capacity in the BARMM. In 2021, the MOH has issued 48 license to operate (LTO) to hospitals/infirmary with a total of 1,416 bed capacity within the BARMM and one pending LTO. By provincial distribution, Basilan has three, Lanao del Sur has eight, Maguindanao has 12, Sulu has nine, Tawi-Tawi has seven, and Marawi City has 10, with a total of 48 hospitals issued with LTO. By classification, there are 15 private infirmaries and nine government infirmaries.

For level 1 hospitals, there are seven private and 18 government hospitals, respectively. On the other hand, only one hospital was classified as level 2, which is the Maguindanao Provincial Hospital. In 2020, 45 out of 49 hospitals in the BARMM are PhilHealth accredited, while the projected bed capacity needed is 4,183 beds. The region has only 1,416 beds and still needs additional 2,767.

**No clear delineation of health policy implementation.** The issue on the actual transfer of health care services to the LGUs was identified as a major hindrance in the delivery of health care services in the region. The health and nutrition services are generally under the regional government of the BARMM through MOH. This is notable in the provinces of Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi, except in the province of Basilan and the cities of Marawi and Lamitan, in which the respective provincial and city governments directly lead the implementation of health care services.

This policy issue was not fully addressed even with the passage of RA 11148, also known as the "Kalusugan at Nutrisyon ng Mag Nanay Act" and RA 11223 of Universal Health Care Law that directs the LGUs to include health and nutrition in their nutrition PPAs since its implementation did not resonate well in Bangsamoro.

According to UNICEF report, significant number of LGUs have poor health governance implementation capacity. The LCEs were found to have limited knowledge on the health and nutritional status of their community, have less commitments to their interventions on malnutrition, teenage pregnancy, and poor access to basic sanitation and safe drinking water which led to significant health issues. Most of the LGUs overlook the significant functions of health and nutrition bodies such as the Local Health Board (LHB), and Local Nutrition Committees (LNC), and the integration of health and nutrition and WaSH plans in the LGUs AIP.

**Poor maternal health care.** BARMM's prenatal, delivery, and post-natal care for women rate are inferior when compared to national averages. The 2017 NDHS recorded that 68.6 percent received antenatal care from a skilled provider, the lowest in the country. Upon birth delivery, only 33.6 percent were attended by skilled birth attendants and a very low 28.4 percent by institutional delivery. Post-natal care coverage also followed a similar path with only 63.6 percent (second lowest nationwide) of women aged 15-49 receiving post-natal checkup in the first two days following delivery.

**Sexual and reproductive health.** Access to and use of modern contraceptive methods is another area where BARMM lags behind the national prevalence rates. BARMM's contraceptive prevalence rate (any contraception method) appears to be very low at 26.3 percent for women aged 15 to 49. Naturally, a low average on use of contraception in the region heightens the risk of early pregnancy, which is closely like national trends with 1.6 percent of women already sexually active before the age of 15. There is no significant difference between the teenage pregnancy rate in BARMM and the national prevalence. The 2017 NDHS data reveals that among women aged 15-19 in BARMM, 8.5 percent have begun childbearing, a percentage slightly lower than the national average of 8.6 percent.

**Low birth weight.** It is expected that infants will be born prematurely when the mothers are malnourished or unhealthy during pregnancy or unhealthy. Poor nutrition is one of the factors that can lead to low birth weight and infants with low birth weight (LBW) are at higher risk of complications or serious health problems as they get older.

In 2015, 2.53 percent of newborn babies in Bangsamoro have low birth weights. This has further decreased to 1.49 percent in 2018 but eventually catapulted to 2.37 percent in 2019, a year just before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the region.

**Low immunization coverage.** The 2017 NDHS showed that ARMM (now BARMM) was the lowest in terms of vaccination coverage with only 18 percent of children 12-23 months received all basic vaccine or fully immunized child (FIC). Only 28.9 percent of its children 6-23 months received 3 doses of Diphtheria, Pertussis and Tetanus (DPT 3). The region has also the highest in proportion of unvaccinated children with 43.7 percent.

### Nutrition

**Malnutrition remains prevalent in BARMM.** Malnutrition in BARMM calls for immediate action. Table 9.10 shows the prevalence and magnitude of these various forms of malnutrition in BARMM in compared to the national average. BARMM is the least in the country and the ASEAN region. This comparative position of BARMM have been a worrying feature of the region as well as in the past Philippine Plan of Action for Nutrition (PPANs). The World Bank-UNICEF Report on Child Nutrition and Mothers'/Caregivers' Perception on Stunting revealed that stunting prevalence in BARMM was 39.1 percent and wasting was 10.0 percent. While wasting rates are highest during the first year of life, stunting statistically increased during the second year of life, a pattern like in the entire country.

The high co-existence of wasting and stunting (WaSt) at 3.2 percent, Tawi-Tawi at 3.6 percent, and Sulu at 5.0 percent is equal to or exceeding the 3.6 percent average for fragile and conflict affected states globally. These children, along those with severe wasting at 3.7 percent are at higher risk for severe illness and mortality. Children from the island provinces of BaSulTa had higher rates of stunting and wasting compared to BARMM's mainland areas. The prevalence cited above means for an urgency to respond to the needs of 25,200 severely wasted children 0-59 months and 21,800 children 0-59 months with the combined problem of wasting and stunting.

In addition, the World Bank-UNICEF Report recorded that the situation for pregnant and lactating women is still bleak, with 22.3 percent of pregnant women who are nutritionally-at-risk compared to 24.7 percent of the national average; and 10.4 percent of lactating women are underweight compared to 13.6 percent of the national average. On the positive side, anemia rates among pregnant and lactating women have been declining at 19.6 percent and 11.6 percent, respectively. Of equal concern is the double burden of malnutrition with steadily increasing prevalence of overweight among children.

Equally worrying is the lack of progress being made in nutrition as shown in Table 9.10 contained from data available from the UNICEF sponsored Situation Analysis of Children in BARMM, 2017, The DOST-FNRI ENNS 2018, 2021 the 2019 UNICEF World Bank Study (2019).

### Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WaSH)

**Limited access to safe drinking water.** WaSH is a main public health concern. Access to potable water and sanitary toilets remains a challenge despite the project implementation of numerous water supply facilities in the region and the abundant water resources such as lakes, rivers, springs, streams, and other untapped water resources. Limited potable water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene practices increase vulnerability to diarrhea and other infectious and water-borne diseases, which are direct causes of acute malnutrition.

**Improve access to basic sanitation facilities.** The access to basic sanitation for households in the BARMM is continuously improving. From 2015 to 2018, the proportion of households with access to basic sanitation has increased from 25.04 percent to 33.84 percent. This further increased to 34.11 percent in 2021. On the other hand, 15.94 percent of barangays in the region are certified zero open defecation and slowly emerged as the region with the worst sanitation status in the country. However, this slight improvement still leaves the region with a substantial number of households with access to better sanitation and transform sanitary practice.

**Low access to potable water.** Access to basic safe water supply in BARMM was consistently below the national average from 2016 to 2020. In 2016, 71.7 percent of households have access to potable water, but it went down to 52.71 percent in 2017. It slowly regained an increase until it reached to 61.25 percent in 2020 which is still lower than the 2016 baseline. Similarly, the FHSIS report showed that acute water diarrhea has been the leading cause of morbidity in the region since 2019.

- 2019: Philippines 72.61%, BARMM 59.5%
- 2020: Philippines -, BARMM 61.25%

**COVID-19 situation in BARMM.** The pandemic caused by COVID-19 that is still challenging the country significantly affected the problematic health care system in the BARMM. As of July 2022, the region still records a 3.50 case fatality rate (CFR) and 4.0 positivity rate, resulting to 19,852 confirmed cases with 693 total deaths.

Aside from poor access to health care facilities and services, the region has registered a low vaccination turnout at 30.55 percent as of the second quarter of 2022. This is attributed to the residents' reluctance to get the vaccine. Some of the concerns expressed include vaccines alleged deadly side effects and ineffectiveness against the coronavirus, and religious beliefs that vaccinations invalidate fasting or are not halal (permitted under Islamic law).

In January 2023, the region was only able to fully vaccinated the 60.77 percent of its population, still below the national target of 70 percent. A new directive was issued to achieve 90 percent of primary series coverage for Priority Group A2 (senior citizens) and 50 percent of the first booster coverage.

**Table 9.11 Percentage and Number of Fully Vaccinated Individuals**

| Province | % of Fully Vaccinated Individuals | No. of Fully Vaccinated Individuals |

| Sulu | 39.73 | 251,271 |
| Basilan | 45.81 | 121,977 |

### Population and Development

**Unmet needs of the population.** Based on the 2015 census, the BARMM's population was 4,273,149, in which it substantially increased to 4,944,800 in 2020. The region's population growth rate also went up from 2.86 percent in the previous census to 3.26 percent in 2020, which is higher compared to other regions in the country. This simply means that the BARMM has the fastest growing population. As a result, unmet needs of the population are continuously increasing as the number of population is growing faster while the delivery of services remains slow.

The figure below shows the distribution of population by age. It shows that out of the 4,944,800 population of the BARMM, 2,792,892 are working age and the rest are dependents.

### Social Welfare

The social welfare subsector covers poverty and vulnerability of the poor and marginalized sectors in the region. This includes women, children, older persons, differently-abled persons, indigenous cultural communities, internally displaced persons (IDPs), and those similarly situated by analogy that may benefit from social service interventions to protect and address their needs.

Early child care and development (ECCD) is given emphasis to ensure that the new generation of the Bangsamoro, after decades of struggle, will enjoy their rights of ECCD consistent with their distinct belief, culture, and aspirations.

**Poverty incidence.** According to PSA report on poverty, BARMM has the highest significant improvement from 52.6 percent in 2018 to 29.80 percent in 2021. However, the region remains as poorest compared to other regions in the country and the island provinces of BaSulTa are among the cluster with relatively high incidence of poverty among families. Accordingly, 2 to 3 out of 10 families in the BARMM belong to poor families. Annual per capita poverty threshold in BARMM is at Php14,126.00, which is ranked 10th in the country.

Several factors contributed to this historic drop in poverty in the region. Among them are the various programs, particularly social protection programs, implemented by the Bangsamoro government supplemented by the existing programs of the national government such as Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) and Social Pension. While there has been a significant drop in the poverty incidence or the proportion of poor Bangsamoro whose per capita income is not sufficient to meet their basic food and non-food needs, the value is still higher than the national average of 23.7 percent.

### Social Protection

**Older persons.** The Social Pension for Indigent Senior Citizen Program is implemented to provide indigent senior citizens who are frail, sick, and disabled with a monthly stipend amounting to Php500, as mandated by RA 9994, otherwise known as "Expanded Senior Citizen Act of 2010". The program aims to augment the capacity of indigent senior citizens to meet their daily subsistence and medical requirements, reduce the incidence of hunger, and protect them from neglect, abuse, and deprivation.

As of December 2021, a total of 159,172 indigent senior citizens are enrolled in the program. From 2017-2021, an increasing trend of older persons can be observed across the BARMM.

**Child labor rampant in BARMM.** Based on the Situation Analysis Report of UNICEF, as of October 2020, 7.5 percent of working children in the Philippines are found in BARMM, with about 54,200 child laborers in the region. This is attributed to high poverty incidence in the region. Children prefer to engage in livelihood activities to help their parents for daily survival. This also affects the education performance of the BARMM as explained in the education subsector.

**Violence Against Children.** Based on the findings of the Child Protection System Assessment in BARMM, there were 93 cases referred into the child protection system in Lanao del Sur from 2017-2021. While the data from Maguindanao did not provide a comprehensive list of child protection referrals, it did indicate that relatively small numbers of cases are coming before the formal protection system. Between 2016 and 2020, 50 children were provided with an initial assessment and 20 were provided with an in-depth child protection assessment. The data further indicates that services were delivered to 90 children (including financial support, counselling, and parenting training), and 23 children were placed in different forms of alternative care over the six years period.

Furthermore, compounded with poverty, decade of armed conflict and underinvestment in essential services for children resulted to a wide range of other child protection issues such as children in conflict with the law, child trafficking, child early and forced marriage (CEFM), child laborers 5-17 years at 9.1 percent, and birth registration rate remains relatively low at 77 percent in the region.

**BARMM has only 1,310 functional day care centers (DCCs) in 2,590 barangays.** All children have the right to go to school and learn. Education transforms children's lives by helping them overcome poverty. It decreases social inequalities, empowers people, and helps everyone reach their full potential. Early child care and development begin at day care center. Absence of this center manifested the absence of concrete initiative for child development. As of March 2022, BARMM has only 1,310 functional DCCs out of 2,590 barangays in the region.

**Table 9.12 Status of Day Care Children and Centers in the BARMM as of March 2022**

**Recurring displacement in BARMM.** With the presence of hydrometeorological and geological hazards coupled with human-induced hazards, displacement is recurring in the region. This situation substantially affects the socioeconomic development of the region. Access to education is hampered, protection mechanisms are weakened, and the problem of health services is worsened. Thus, aggravate the pre-existing child protection issues and present new risks and threats such as high prevalence rate of child labor, trafficking, increasing number of out-of-school youth (OSY), illegal recruitment and family separation.

As of September 2022, 914 families (4,570 people) are still displaced due to armed conflict, with a direct effect on children and girls in particular, who become more vulnerable to child marriage when displaced. In addition, children continue to be exposed to grave violations in BARMM provinces, although such instances are in decline. For example, between January 2020 and December 2021, 27 verified incidents of killing and maiming of children were committed in Maguindanao and 14 in Sulu, and one attack on a school in Maguindanao was reported, whereas in 2017, 135 violations were committed, which mostly took place in the Lanao del Sur Province. In addition, the conflict has left behind many orphans of soldiers, or civilians killed. Whilst there is no official data on orphans of war, an unofficial database held by the MILF's Social Welfare Committee (SWC) reportedly "has a list of 8,182 orphans covering 26 out of 47 revolutionary 'provinces' as of April 2019", while "the MILF's Bangsamoro Islamic Women Auxiliary Brigade (BIWAB) is working on a partial list with just over 500 widows and a similar number of orphans as of January 2020."

Based on IDP Durable Solution Report, there are 93,525 IDPs in the BARMM, including the protracted displaced in Marawi City and other areas in the region, which represents 82.5 percent of the total number of IDPs in Mindanao as of August 2022. A total of 329,360 individuals are affected by armed conflict and flooding in Maguindanao.

**Protection of persons with disability.** There are 53,483 PWDs with increased capacity to meet their daily subsistence and medical requirements. Government programs are carefully laid to ensure their meaningful participation in the society.

**Gender and development (GAD).** There has been progress in terms of compliance at the regional level on the mandated implementation of at least five 5.0 percent of the total annual budget of each ministry and office. A review of the GAD Plans and Budgets (GPBs) at the regional level revealed that for FY 2021, 6.1 percent of the Php75.6 billion appropriation of the regional government, or Php4,661,116,872.32 was utilized for GAD. This was an improvement from 2020's Php255.52 million. The increase in GAD utilization was a result of the improved GAD attribution using the Harmonized GAD Guidelines (HGDG). However, most of the direct GAD interventions in the GPBs were on building and strengthening the capacities of ministries and offices. This is understandable because majority of the personnel are newly hired. However, there should have been a ladderized training program to allow GAD planners and implementers to progress on their GAD knowledge, skills, and attitude. These three competencies are critical to ensuring a more effective and efficient GAD planning, budgeting, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation.

## Development Opportunities

Despite the pressing challenges mentioned above, the Bangsamoro government has identified the following opportunities that can be harnessed to address the identified challenges.

**Commitment of development partners to support BARMM.** Immediately after the passage of the BOL, various international donor institutions renewed and enhanced their support to the new autonomous region. This is to facilitate the implementation of a peace agreement between the GPH and the MILF.

The presence of these development partners is a great opportunity for the Bangsamoro government to fast track the socioeconomic development of the BARMM. They fill in the gaps that cannot be covered by the existing resources of the region, especially in the areas of capacity development, policy formulation, planning, and investment programming. Moreover, development partners pursue public interest agenda and aid government agencies in its peace and development efforts.

**Strong inter-governmental relations and support from the national government.** The creation of National government-Bangsamoro government IGRB under Section 2 of RA 11054 is another opportunity to serve as venue of vertical communication for proper implementation of the peace agreement and to foster clear cooperation and complementation between the national government and the Bangsamoro government. Under the said provision, the IGRB shall exhaust all means to resolve issues brought before it. Unresolved issues shall be elevated to the President, through the Chief Minister.

**Devolution of basic services under Mandanas-Garcia ruling.** The implementation of Mandanas-Garcia Ruling is another opportunity since it strengthens the devolution of delivery of basic services to LGUs. Although EO 138 does not include BARMM, but the principle of devolution of basic services and facilities to the LGUs and the determination of the functional assignments between and among the different levels of government shall be observed.

This is an opportunity for the BARMM to strengthen decentralization and improve social services delivery. Also, it will lead to better coordination in planning and implementation across levels of government because of proper delineation of powers and responsibilities that could contribute in improving the lives of people and communities, especially in far-flung areas.

**Three-year extension transition period.** The extension of transition period to 2025 will help the Bangsamoro government to fully operationalize the government structure, and complete the enactment of remaining priority codes and issuance of policy guidelines, to clearly define and delineate the powers, functions and responsibilities, and strengthening horizontal and vertical coordination and linkages.

**Fiscal autonomy.** Granting of fiscal autonomy to the Bangsamoro government is another opportunity since the BARMM is now authorized to design and finance its own development program according to the region's thrusts and priorities with minimal restrictions.

As provided in the BOL, the Bangsamoro government shall enjoy fiscal autonomy with the end view of attaining economic self-sufficiency and genuine development. The Bangsamoro government is entitled to all fund sources enumerated herein and shall have the power to create its sources of revenues, which shall be spent in a programmatic, transparent, performance-based, and phased manner. It shall prepare its budget and allocate funds in accordance with an annual appropriations law passed by the Parliament.

**Presence of universities, colleges, other formal and informal academic stakeholders.** Utilization of existing universities, colleges, and other formal and informal academic institutions is also considered as an opportunity like MSU-Main in Marawi City and MSU-Maguindanao, and informal education such as a mobile library for street children in Cotabato City, as well as Tahfizul Qur-an in Basilan and Marawi City as these will provide more access to balanced quality education in the BARMM.

**Presence of functional women and youth organizations/cooperatives in the mainland and island provinces.** Their participation in governance representing women and youth sectors will help make the decision-making more inclusive and meaningful.

## Priority Challenges

**Increasing vulnerability due to high poverty and social inequality.** Social injustice hampered the access of people from enjoying basic services. As a consequence, the region is suffering from a low HDI that includes low level of family income, low functional literacy rate, and short life expectancy. Thus, the level of vulnerability to natural and human-induced disasters worsened due to limited adaptive capacity as a result of poverty. In addition, recurring displacement, loss of life, destruction of properties, and cyclical disruption of socioeconomic activities become an undesired usual phenomenon. At the sub-sectoral level, BARMM is confronted with the following challenges:

### Education

**Limited access to quality, responsive, and relevant education** - The BARMM faces serious challenges of poor access to and low-quality education — basic, higher, technical, and Madaris education. Perennial issue on poor educational governance and management at the community level worsens the situation.

a. **Poor access to education** - As a consequence, the region lags behind compared to other regions in most education indicators. The net enrolment rate for the region is posted at 72.63 percent for elementary, and 30.37 percent for secondary compared to the national average of 94.19 percent and 76.0 percent, respectively. The completion rate for primary and secondary are the lowest, while the dropout rate for primary and secondary is the highest in the country. The region has the lowest cohort survival rate of 64.75 percent. Another factor affecting education in the BARMM is the plaguing of poverty as the poor family prefers to let their children help daily earning rather than sending them to school. Also, some students do not have interest in taking up agricultural-related courses.

b. **Low quality education.** Construction of classrooms and provision of learning materials paralleled a fast-growing population is another factor that affects education in the BARMM. Based on a result of consultation with young people, some schools are too dense, teacher and students' ratio are not favorable for learning, not to mention the shortage of classrooms and other facilities. In addition, the poor education management at the grassroot level substantially affects the region's quality education at the different levels. Incomplete institutionalization of Madaris education, weak support for public and private Madrasah, and low salaries of Asatidz particularly in GIDA were also some of the issues confronting the region.

### Health, Nutrition, and WaSH

**Limited access and utilization of quality health service.** The Bangsamoro health sector is confronted with the serious challenge of improving accessibility and providing quality health services. This can be associated with the following key issues such as:

a. **Inefficient healthcare system.** The low turnout of the health outcomes in the region constitutes the inadequacy of skilled human resources and equipped functional health facilities. These can be associated with weak, if not lacking, context-based policies, regulations, and funding. Additionally, the unavailability of data and the poor data management on health, and challenging geography are also among the factors that hamper identification of accurate strategic action to improve the healthcare system in the region.

The limited involvement of the LGUs in delivering health services in their respective communities is also a challenge. The political will, including the budget allocation for health from the LGUs, are an essential factor in improving the health outcomes in the region but remain a challenge despite the moral governance advocacy of the BARMM government.

b. **Limited access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene services.** Over the years, varying data on the accessibility and availability of sanitation and safe water exhibited poor programming due to the lack of mechanisms that should provide long-term solutions to the existing gaps. The problem also lies in the limited involvement of the LGUs in enforcing existing national and regional ordinances on environmental health and sanitation. Furthermore, the lack of a cohesive environmental plan, especially at the LGU level, highly contributed to the poor health status of the region, especially in water-borne related diseases. A comprehensive Adolescent Health, Nutrition and WASH program is also limited in BARMM.

c. **Inadequate dietary intake.** There are existing policies and plans for FSN in BARMM. However, weak structures and harmonization affect the accuracy of the planning, financing, policymaking, and implementation of programs, projects, and activities. While at the LGU level, the lack of initiatives and efforts to combat malnutrition highly contributed to the poor nutrition situation in the region. Additionally, there is a weak monitoring system for implementing these plans and policies. It has also been identified that the limited opportunities for the livelihood of families in BARMM remain one of the contributors to prevalent nutritional imbalances and food insecurity in the region. The cost of nutritious diet is very high determined by levels of food production, stock, and net trade. The physical and economic access to nutritious food especially among the marginalized sector of the community is limited. Food utilization is also very low.

On the other hand, micronutrient supplementation, supplementary feeding, management of acute malnutrition and overweight prevention and management is a big gap to be addressed in the region.

d. **Behavioral change.** Some Bangsamoro are hesitant to avail health services due to limited awareness on the importance of modern healing methods. This is evident in low turnout of COVID-19 vaccination and other health services. This is worsened by the prevalence of malnutrition, improper sanitation, increasing number of teenage pregnancy and continuously growing number of unmet needs of the population especially at the community level due to poor family planning services, traditional mindset, and poor IEC awareness on family planning.

### Social Welfare

**High number of poor and vulnerable people in the BARMM.** BARMM is challenged with the high number of poor and vulnerable people with limited meaningful participation in the basic sectors. Based on the 2021 poverty incidence released by the PSA, the region recorded the highest decline in poverty incidence among families from 52.60 percent in 2018 to 29.80 percent in 2021. It is worth noting that 3 out of the 5 provinces of BARMM reduced the number of poor families with Lanao del Sur having the highest decrease from 64.2 percent in 2018 to 7.4 percent in 2021. In contrast, two of the region's provinces, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi, increased the number of poor families from 75.3 percent and 15.1 percent in 2018 to 51.0 percent and 28.1 percent respectively in 2021.

Approximately, 408,951 Bangsamoro families live in poverty. With a high volume of inequality, poverty remains to be one of the most significant challenges in the BARMM.

Poor people in the BARMM are more vulnerable to falling further into extreme poverty due to their exposure to disasters. A person's age, sex, disabilities, cultural, and religious identities; access to income opportunities and other safety nets; and level of participation in decision-making processes further amplify their vulnerabilities.

a. **High vulnerability to human-induced and natural disasters.** One of the main contributing factors to BARMM's high poverty incidence is the region's high vulnerability to shocks, with over a third of all households in BARMM affected by at least one emergency in any given year. With limited coping mechanisms at their disposal, most households in BARMM cannot deal with the impact of shocks, further aggravating their dire situation.

Four of the five provinces in BARMM are considered the most drought-prone in the country. These are Sulu, Basilan, Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur. Maguindanao appears to be the province most affected by natural disasters.

BARMM is particularly vulnerable to climate change, which is expected to increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. All five provinces in BARMM are either 'vulnerable' or 'highly vulnerable' to El Niño induced drought, temperature increases, and rising sea levels brought about by climate change. The region's poorest and most vulnerable households are highly exposed to naturally occurring hazards and have the least capacity to cope with or adapt to the changing climate. Moreover, vulnerable groups such as women, children, the elderly, and those with disabilities face a range of pre-existing challenges that are often compounded by disasters. For example, natural disasters often negatively impact access to basic services and render children more vulnerable to deprivation of their basic rights.

Amidst vulnerability to extreme weather events, disaster risk management in the BARMM is significantly challenged due to poor mobilization of disaster management and poor disaster allocation; insufficient government initiatives to calamities; poor knowledge of community disaster preparedness programs; and loose compliance to local government code. Moreover, there are no trained community-based DRR for COs; evacuation facilities are absent, and there is a lack of proper utilization of funds which is intended for DRR.

During emergencies and crises, women and girls, children and young people become vulnerable to exploitation and violence due to the breakdown of community networks and structures, and lack of protection mechanisms. GBV is also one of the key drivers of conflict that often escalates into full-scale family feud or rido.

Particular attention must be given to the IDPs in the region to promote their rights and welfare, ensure their safe return, and prevent new or recurrent displacement. In addition, the Bangsamoro government is committed in addressing the high vulnerability of OFWs to maltreatment and trafficking.

b. **Low social protection coverage among poor families.** Social welfare programs in BARMM are composed of both national and regional programs, each of which is designed to a particular vulnerable sector, including orphaned children, individuals living with disabilities, and poor and vulnerable households. The national programs are designed, financed, and overseen by the national government, and include national flagship social protection programs such as the 4Ps, SLP and the social pension.

The regional social welfare programs are implemented and financed by MSSD to ensure that vulnerable sub-groups of the population are protected. These programs are specifically geared to stem social vulnerabilities that arise from personal characteristics such as age, disability, and familial circumstances.

However, the implementation of social programs in the BARMM is not clear in terms of linkages between DRM at the policy level. Disaster risk and vulnerability assessments have not been conducted across all LGUs. A thorough understanding of the different risks faced by different geographic areas and population groups is essential to inform strategies for social protection scale-up.

There is no formal early warning system for conflict. Some informal mechanisms are present at the grassroots level, but these are not systematically adopted into government systems. Many IDPs are without documentation and as such face barriers in accessing services.

Current social transfer programming largely excludes children in the first 1,000 days of their lives, a critical period for investment from an economic and human developmental perspective and has a fragmented regional poverty registry. Developing a BARMM poverty registry will enable the flow and management of information to ensure a more responsive, equitable and inclusive distribution of resources while also increasing efficiency and effectiveness of social protection delivery, thus, better serving the Bangsamoro.

The majority of the population are in the informal sector, with no access to social protection coverage. Based on IDP Durable Solution Report, IDPs have poor access to information affecting their welfare, a finding that was surfaced in a consultative forum. They feel excluded and, sometimes, discriminated. The political and security environment can, in some areas, curtail their ability to properly exercise their rights to vote and be consulted regarding public and peace matters.

c. **Low-income opportunities.** BARMM ranks third with the highest prevalence of child labor in the country according to PSA. Due to poverty, children are forced to work instead of sending them to school. In 2017, net enrollment rates in BARMM fell below the national average by about 20 percentage points at the elementary level and 45 percentage points at the junior high school (JHS) level. The regional school completion rates are equally concerning, particularly for indigenous children. Only 48.5 percent of indigenous children in BARMM attend elementary school while 11.2 percent complete basic education. In 2019, only 10.0 percent of the child population reached at least college level or higher and only 1 out of every 10 students who begin primary education completes JHS on time.

The figures point to a crisis in the delivery of basic education in the BARMM, a crisis that needs to be addressed as a priority to keep children in school and to provide better quality education. Also, a combination of armed conflict, exclusion, marginalization, and child labor have contributed to lagging education.

In addition to poor educational attainment in BARMM is the poor access to educational opportunities such as scholarships and other study grant programs and poor access to livelihood opportunities and disrupted livelihoods due to displacement.

d. **Low meaningful participation of basic sector.** Some LGUs do not recognize the importance or representation of the basic sector, such as women, adolescents and youth, senior citizens, and PWDs, during council meetings, resulting in low meaningful participation of the basic sector. One of the reasons is lack of proper and contextualized engagement that provides truthful representation, lack of basic learning development on organizational, sectoral, and community-based empowerment, the presence of direct and indirect sectoral discrimination or biases, and poor local government initiatives to engage local sectors in every program.

Also putting forward the interests of the young people at the political table is sometimes discounted and overlooked citing it lacks the notion of meaningful participation in local governance. Prevailing laws recognize a fixed 10.0 percent budget for the sector, but it is relatively detached and marked as a less priority. Preferential system in local politics is widely practiced. Similarly, people/children with disabilities are often omitted in the local agendas and the BLGUs do not have a designated desk for them catering to their appeals.

## Priority Programs

### Education

**Inclusive Learning Enhancement and Advancement Program (ILEAP).** This program is composed of different projects namely: Enhanced Abot Kaalaman sa Pamilyang Bangsamoro (E-AKAP), which supports the intensification of the Early Childhood Education implementation, schools' expansion (Elementary, Junior, and Senior High schools) among GIDAs and other unserved communities, provision of appropriate learning resources and facilities, Digitizing Classrooms, provide transportation services for the Teachers and Learners, establishment of Inclusive Learning Resource Centers (ILRC), Energizing Non-Grid Schools, Establishment of E-Libraries, establishment of health facilities, Scholarship Programs, establishment of Higher Education Institutions and provision of Education in Emergencies (EIE) facilities.

**IPEdukado Program.** This program aims to strengthen Indigenous People's Education by increasing access to basic and technical education through the establishment of Indigenous Peoples Education (IPED) Centers across the region. The same program is also aimed to pave the establishment and institutionalization of the first Tribal University providing higher education programs among IP students.

**Expanded Bangsamoro Access to Alternative Learning Services.** This program aims to institutionalize an Inclusive Education Framework underpinning the development of the Special Education (SPED) and Alternative Learning System (ALS) in Bangsamoro including the expansion of the Learning Centers across the region and increasing and professionalization of the SPED and ALS teachers.

# Chapter 10: Enhancing and strengthening the peace, public order, safety, and security, and upholding human rights for peaceful, safe, and resilient Bangsamoro communities

The BOL stipulates provisions about transitional justice, Indigenous People's rights, and human rights; roles of the different law enforcement and security agencies; the importance of DRR-CCA; the role of the national government and Bangsamoro government in the normalization process; among others.

This chapter covers four sub-sectors, namely, peace and security, public order and safety, peacebuilding, and human rights.

This chapter supports both SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals and SDG 16 — Peace, justice, and strong institutions. Support for the eighth point of President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.'s Eight Point Socioeconomic Agenda, "Uphold Public Order and Safety, Peace and Security," is likewise supported by this.

Further, this chapter supports the enhanced 12-Point Priority Agenda of the BARMM particularly Agenda 8 which aims to build the resilience of Bangsamoro communities from human-induced and natural disasters including emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, and adaptive capacities to climate change by pursuing a holistic approach to disaster prevention and mitigation, preparedness, response, recovery, and rehabilitation; Agenda 10 which aims to provide meaningful and IDP-centered support to the ongoing rehabilitation, reconstruction, and recovery of Marawi City; and Agenda 11 that aims to sustain and improve peace, justice, and security across the BARMM through strong coordination and proactive collaboration with law enforcement agencies, development partners, and other relevant agencies and stakeholders.

Overall, this chapter discusses the BARMM's continual challenges to peace and order, security and threats, public safety, and human rights violations, as well as the specific interventions of the Bangsamoro government to address these interminable issues.

## Sectoral Assessment

The Bangsamoro government has been working on sustaining the gains of the peace process and improving the security of the Bangsamoro. It continues to increase and develop the resiliency of its constituents against natural calamities, human-induced disasters, and pandemics. Further, it ensures the protection and promotion of human rights and continues conflict-sensitive and peace-promoting initiatives for progressive and sustainable development in Bangsamoro.

In achieving lasting peace, the Bangsamoro government has accomplished a lot of things in the past three years. Several programs, projects, activities, and policies were implemented in ensuring peace and security in the region, it has also intensified peacebuilding efforts work. However, there is a lot of work that needs to be done for the Bangsamoro government to maintain public order and safety, and respect for human rights.

### Sectoral Trends

#### Peace and Security

**Sustaining the gains of the peace process.** After the ratification of RA 11054, also known as the BOL in 2019, there was a significant decline in the frequency and intensity of violence in the region. The three-year transition, 2020 to 2022, has been extended by RA 11593, giving the BTA the extension by resetting the BTA election in 2025. It provides enough time for the existing BTA to accomplish the critical plans that were laid down for Bangsamoro in sustaining the gains from the peace agreement over the last years.

**73 cleared barangays in Local Terrorist Group (LTG) Areas.** Even with the extension of BTA, the threat brought by extremist groups continues in some areas of BARMM. Also, some local insurgents still threaten the stability of the peace and order in the provinces of Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Basilan, and Sulu.

The challenges posed by the lingering idea of terrorism and violent extremism remain among the major concerns for peace and order, and security in the region. Skirmishes between security forces and LTGs, though in a continuing decline since 2018, have been recorded for the past five years. Violent extremists operating in the region still can terrorize the public through bombing and extortion.

Despite the threats from the LTGs, the security sector has been working on addressing this concern. As of May 2021, there are 73 cleared barangays in LTG Areas as recommended by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).

**Table 10.1 Number of Cleared Barangays in Local Terrorist Group Areas, 2021**

| Province | Number of Barangay |
|----------|-------------------|
| Lanao del Sur | 11 |
| Maguindanao | 16 |
| Sulu | 4 |
| Basilan | 42 |
| **Total** | **73** |

*Source: MILG*

**Manageable peace and order situation.** The threat brought by extremist groups affects the tranquility and economic stability of the region. The PRO-BAR uses a four-level threat advisory system that assesses the possibility of terror attacks from threat groups. As of October 2021, there are 22 municipalities under high threat terrorism levels while 12 municipalities are under moderate threat levels of terrorism. Despite this, the peace and order situation in the region is manageable through the efforts of the security sector and law enforcement agencies proactive measures.

**Table 10.2 Level of Terrorism Threat, by Province, 2021**

| Province | High | Moderate |
|----------|------|----------|
| Lanao del Sur | 5 | 2 |
| Maguindanao | 13 | 6 |
| Sulu | 3 | 1 |
| Basilan | 1 | 3 |
| Tawi-Tawi | 0 | 0 |
| **Total** | **22** | **12** |

**Presence of AFP, MILF camps, and the presence of Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) stations in strategic areas of BARMM.** BARMM was also strengthened by the activation of the Joint Peace and Security Team (JPST)- tri-forces composed of elements of AFP, Philippine National Police (PNP), and MILF- Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces (MILF-BIAF) which helped in the maintenance of peace, public order, and stability of mutually agreed areas in BARMM and other conflict-affected areas in Mindanao.

**Active private armed groups (PAGs) reduced.** The PRO-BAR recorded a total of 18 PAGs operating in the Bangsamoro region. As of 2021, PAGs are reduced to one through delisting due to inactivity, delisting through voluntary surrender, and delisting through law enforcement operations.

**No crew abductions within Bangsamoro waters.** The PCG reported zero maritime abductions in 2021, compared to five (Indonesian) in 2020 and 22 (Filipinos, Vietnamese, and Indonesians) abductions from 2016 to 2017, showing a gradual decrease in numbers. These maritime incidents pertain to crew abductions from ships for ransom that have been prevalent along the waters of Sulu - Celebes Seas, which also falls under the BARMM. The PCG, in line with its mandate in cooperation and collaboration with its partner agencies, AFP and PNP, and the support of the local government of Sibutu, Tawi-Tawi has contributed to the said decrease.

Furthermore, the PCG established a radar station at Sibutu, Tawi-Tawi that safely monitors 19,563 vessels going North and South in 2021 and 6,694 vessels from January to May 2022 alone. It also implemented the Department of Transportation (DOTr) MC 2017-001 Safety, Security, and Environmental Numbering System for all Philippine vessels with the support of the LGUs of the BARMM.

**29 lupon members and barangay officials awarded with LTIA.** The Bangsamoro government recognizes local officials who have exerted exemplary efforts in governance and leadership, contributing to the promotion of moral governance and peace sustainability. In 2020, there were 29 lupon members and barangay officials awarded with LTIA.

#### Public Order and Safety

**A breakthrough in rido settlement but family feud remains implacable during the BARMM transition period.** In 2021, the Ministry of Public Order and Safety (MPOS) made a breakthrough by successfully resolving a three-decade long rido or family feud between two prominent families in the province of Lanao del Sur. In the record of MPOS, the highest number of rido cases is recorded in Lanao del Sur with a total of 332 cases. The BARMM has profiled a total of 552 cases, with 272 settled between 2019 to 2021.

**Table 10.3 Profiled Rido Cases in BARMM, by Province/City, 2022**

| Province | Number of Cases |
|----------|-----------------|
| Lanao del Sur | 332 |
| Maguindanao | 95 |

**The Regional Crime Index of BARMM reduced by more than 42 percent in 2021 compared to 2017.** The PNP reported in 2017 a total of 1,676 index crimes in the BARMM covering the five provinces and Cotabato City. Data shows that there was a significant and consistent decrease in crime index in each succeeding annual period. By the end of 2021, a total of 710 crime indexes were reported which was 42 percent less than 2017.

**High crime solution efficiency rate despite the high demand for additional police forces.** The increased number of deployed police forces in the BARMM was considered one of the huge contributory factors towards the said achievement. In 2017, there was 6,703 total police personnel deployed in different areas of Bangsamoro. However, when compared to the national standard ratio, the Bangsamoro region's demand for additional police forces remains high.

**Table 10.5 Police Force, National vs. BARMM, 2017-2022**

| | Standard Ratio | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |
|---|----------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| National Police Office | 1:500 | 1:489 | 1:505 | 1:572 | 1:506 | 1:572 | 1:489 |
| BARMM | 1:500 | 1:532 | 1:516 | 1:507 | 1:553 | 1:566 | 1:574 |

*Source: PRO-BAR*

Nonetheless, the increasing efficiency rate of 51.74 percent in 2017 to 69.50 percent in 2019 shows the effectiveness of PRO-BAR in solving criminalities in the Bangsamoro region. This is a result of the incessant and strong collaboration of law enforcers and the Bangsamoro government together with its constituent Bangsamoro communities. The augmentation provided by the current government of the day strengthened the operational capacity of the LEAs which made them operationally more visible and responsive. Moreover, the whole-of-nation approach adopted by the AFP and the various LEAs in fighting criminalities was also instrumental in the achievement of this goal.

**Table 10.6 Crime Volume, Crime Rate, and Crime Solution Efficiency, by Provinces, 2017-2020**

| Indicator | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |
|-----------|------|------|------|------|
| Total Crime Volume | 3,819 | 2,977 | 2,688 | 2,388 |
| Average Monthly Crime Rate | 7.33% | 5.72% | 5.13% | 4.49% |
| Total of Crime Solved | 1,976 | 1,903 | 1,808 | 1,625 |
| Crime Solution Efficiency Rate | 51.74% | 63.92% | 67.77% | 69.50% |

**Increase in drug-cleared barangays in the region.** The Barangay Drug Clearing Program (BDCP) seeks to lessen the number of barangays that are adversely affected by drugs in the nation by removing drugs from users, removing the allure of illegal drugs, and reducing the effects of the drug problem in the community by enlisting the assistance of all relevant parties and duty bearers.

The BDCP implementation involves the harmonized efforts of the national and local government units in Bangsamoro, as well as of LEAs mandated to implement the anti-drug law in coordination with the Anti-Drug Abuse Council (ADAC) in their respective areas of responsibility. The series of processes involved in the implementation of the program such as the reformation of drug personalities identified by the joint efforts of every Barangay Anti-Drug Abuse Council (BADAC), PNP, AFP, and other law enforcement units, provide considerable contributions to the success of the program. Regardless, other internal hindering factors in the implementation of the program such as the involvement of high-value drug personalities (validation, verification, and adjudication is a very time-consuming process), and the emergence of newly identified drug offenders and surrenderers resulted in the reversion of the status of declared drug-cleared/drug-free barangays to drug-affected barangays during the period covered. This prevents the sustainability of the program in some barangays, thus reducing their efficiency in complying with the requirements of the BDCP.

As of May 2022, out of the 2,590 total barangays in BARMM (with the inclusion of the 63 barangays of the SGA) 1,955 barangays were identified as drug-affected barangays upon the implementation of the BDCP in CY 2017. The Regional Oversight Committee also declared 867 drug-affected barangays as drug-cleared barangays as of May 2022. A total of 1,088 barangays remains under the category of drug-affected barangay. Further, 174 unaffected barangays were certified as drug-free or unaffected barangay by the Regional Oversight Committee and 461 barangays are still to be certified as drug-free or unaffected barangays.

The significant increase in the number of drug-cleared barangays during the period covered can be attributed to the willingness of the LGUs in Bangsamoro region to implement the program. However, due to some other factors such as geographical location, environmental accessibility to deliver the program, and other sociological considerations in the island provinces, the implementation of the BDCP in BaSulTa is considerably behind as compared to the current status of the provinces of Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur.

**Table 10.7 Drug-Cleared/Free Barangay, by Province/City, as of May 2022**

**Enhancement of fire safety enforcement of the establishments in BARMM.** From 2017 to 2020, there was an increase in the number of fire-related incidents. Despite this, BFP-BARMM has inspected 63,263 establishments since 2017. There was an increase in the number of establishments adhering to fire safety requirements. This can be seen in the number of inspected establishments in the Bangsamoro which has notably escalated from 9,777 in 2017 to 16,874 in 2021 or a rate of 172.6 percent in four-year time, particularly higher in Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur.

For fire-related incidents related to human costs, Sulu recorded the highest number of killed and injured in 2021, which is 52 and 58, respectively. These can be attributed to the incident in 2021 Philippine Air Force C-130 crash in Patikul, Sulu.

The national standard requires that there should be at least one fire station in every municipality or city with adequate personnel, complete firefighting facilities, and equipment. As of 2021, there are 56 cities and municipalities with fire stations and 42 with fire trucks in the BARMM. Maguindanao has 20 fire stations and 19 fire trucks; Lanao del Sur has 19 fire stations and nine fire trucks, Sulu has seven fire stations and seven fire trucks; Basilan with five fire stations and four fire trucks, and Tawi-Tawi has the lowest number of fire stations and fire truck, with four and two, respectively.

**Decrease in the jail population.** The intensified program of Duterte's Administration against illegal drugs compels concerned LEAs to conduct 24/7 operations against violators. Hence, numerous commitment orders were issued by the competent courts directing jail stations in Maguindanao and Cotabato City Jail to accommodate arrested violators.

Further, in August 2019 there was a significant increase in the jail population. This was due to the addition of Cotabato City Jail as a result of the ARMM to BARMM transition. In 2020, there was a steady increase in the jail population, this was due to the movement and commitment restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Due to this, numerous members of BJMP-BARMM personnel were assigned to Maguindanao province and Cotabato City. These jail personnel were performing custodial, escorting, security, and paralegal duties at all jail stations of the mentioned province and city.

**Table 10.9 Custodial Service Efficiency of BJMP-BARMM, 3rd Quarter 2022**

| Facility | Jail Population | Congestion Rate (Percent) |

With the easing of the pandemic restrictions in 2021 and the transfer of persons deprived of liberty (PDL) from PNP detention, there was a significant increase in the jail population. From January to September 2022, intensified paralegal services on releases resulted in a decrease in the jail population. The third quarter data on congestion rate shows a decrease to 193 percent from 261 percent.

#### Peacebuilding

The gains of the peace process obtained from the peace agreement must be sustained, thus the promotion of peacebuilding initiatives is one of the priorities of the peace, public order, safety, and security sector.

**Significant accomplishments on peacebuilding towards normalization.** Supplemental to the interventions of the normalization process, peacebuilding programs cater to the former combatants, their families, and communities, as well as those who are not covered by the normalization programs.

The BARMM recorded in 2021 a remarkable accomplishment versus its target peacebuilding programs to vulnerable combatants with 180 against 50, vulnerable widows of martyrs with 47 against 30, and local insurgents with 74 against 30. Interventions comprised of organizing and capacitating former combatants who did not qualify in the decommissioning program of the national government, including the widows and orphans of martyrs left in the margins; and attracting local insurgents to return to the folds of the law and transform them into valuable resources of the Bangsamoro.

The BARMM profiled 33 MILF camps that are subscribed to the MILF Central Committee. These camps are beneficiaries, especially the members of the BIAF who are not part of the decommissioning program of the national government. Combatants who are residing in the camps, who have no sufficient means to support their families and combatants who are vulnerable or prone to be recruited by violent extremists or other lawless elements are prioritized to benefit in the peacebuilding initiatives.

**Table 10.10 Number of Base Camps, BARMM, 2022**

| Province/City | No. of Base Camp | Name of Base Camp |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Regional | 1 | 128th Base Camp |
| Maguindanao | 6 | 105th Base Camp, 106th Base Camp, 109th Base Camp, 118th Base Camp, General Headquarters, Head Quarters |
| Lanao del Sur | 12 | 101st Base Camp, 102nd Base Camp, 103rd Base Camp, 116th Base Camp, 119th Base Camp, 120th Base Camp, 121st Base Camp, 122nd Base Camp, 123rd Base Camp, 124th Base Camp, 127th Base Camp, Nat'l Guard Base Command |

**Camp Transformation Plan (CTP) 2020-2026.** One part of the normalization process is transforming the conflict-affected areas into communities that would help the residents achieve their desired quality of life, which includes the pursuit of sustainable livelihoods and political participation. The CTP 2020-2026 is formulated to implement the projects and programs that will transform the camps into productive communities. The target beneficiaries of the CTP 2020-2026 are centered on the six acknowledged MILF Camps, namely: Camp Abu Bakar, Camp Bushra, Camp Omar, Camp Rajah Muda, Camp Badr, and Camp Bilal.

**Commemoration of Bangsamoro History Month.** The promotion of peacebuilding includes the recognition of the historical events commemorated by the Bangsamoro government. The issuance of Proclamation No. 0001 of the OCM, declaring the Bangsamoro History Month every month of March, recognizes the many significant events in the history of the Bangsamoro in pursuit of peace and the right to self-determination. Among these significant events are Jabidah Massacre, Bud Dajo Massacre, Dansalan Declaration, All-Out War against MILF, Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro, and Inauguration of the BARMM and Inaugural Session of the BTA. These events warrant proper recognition, commemoration, or celebration as part of the peacebuilding effort of the Bangsamoro government.

#### Human Rights

**Decline in human rights violations.** In terms of the horizontal conflicts, land disputes and clan or family feud continue to be the major causes of grave human rights violations, including internal displacement. However, with some notable exceptions, the State, either has failed to investigate the pattern and gravity of these violations or its efforts in this regard have been insufficient. As a result, the State is remiss in its obligation to elicit the facts behind allegations of abuse, to ensure the accountability of perpetrators, and to provide reparation for the victim and survivors.

A significant decrease in human rights violations was recorded in the BARMM from 90 cases in 2019 to 38 cases in 2021. Among the BARMM provinces, Maguindanao registered the highest number of cases with 13, whereas Tawi-Tawi has 10, Lanao del Sur has six, and Basilan has four. While no case was recorded for Sulu.

**Figure 10.4 Number of Human Rights Cases Investigated, by Province, 2017-2021**

**Building blocks for transitional justice and reconciliation (TJR).** The Bangsamoro government, through the BHRC, has included in its strategic priorities efforts to better understand and articulate the role that transitional justice processes can play. The TJR process is pivotal in sustaining peace, attainment of sustainable development goals, prevention of human rights abuses or violations, and the implications of this on how such processes are conceptualized, designed, and implemented.

**Risk of gender-based violence (GBV) remains high.** A rapid assessment of GBV and child protection concerns was taken on in October 2017 by the GBV Working Group. It has been revealed that children and young women encountered an increased risk of GBV, including sexual abuse, exploitation, and Child Early and Forced Marriage (CEFM). In the GBV report, 45 percent of the conflict-affected areas reviewed have reported that girls were the most affected by sexual violence. The complex interplay of religious, cultural, political, and economic factors extends the culture of silence around the issue of GBV. Meanwhile, the fear of rejection from society deterred the survivors from telling their stories. Marrying off the victim to the perpetrator is the usual form of amicable settlement purportedly to avoid family feuds.

As documented by the BWC, there were 16 cases of VAWC reported in 2019, 18 cases in 2020, and 28 cases in 2021, with 23 involving ages 10 to 40 women and children.

The GAD-GBV remains one of the most prevalent and persistent issues facing women and girls in BARMM. Conflict and other humanitarian emergencies place women and girls at increased risk of many forms of GBV. It includes acts that inflict physical, sexual, or mental harm or suffering, which elevates to becoming a pressing public health issue. Anent to this, it also includes threats of such acts, coercion, and other deprivations of liberty, which too, can greatly affect all cultural identities and socioeconomic classes in the region.

Increasing issues on GBV continue to be a rising problem in BARMM. Most of the recorded cases across the region are denied legal assistance due to excessive poverty and geographic placement, even noting their lack of information about their rights. Most cases result in an amicable settlement because of fear, especially as a precaution against clan feuds, and the like.

As documented by the Commission, there were 16 cases of VAWC reported in 2019, 18 cases in 2020, 28 cases in 2021, and 11 cases from the first quarter of 2022. Women and children between the ages of 10 to 40 years old have reported a total of 23 cases. The reported perpetrators were either their husbands, fathers, aunts, or male neighbors. The abuses include sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, psychological violence, financial abuse, and domestic violence.

There is a steady increase in the number of reported cases which may be due to two reasons. One is that these women or young girls are now knowledgeable of the BWC's mandate and underlying services. The other reason for this includes the perpetrator's reduced fear of being penalized because said heinous acts can be settled by their community leaders with very minimal consequence which is alarming.

**Figure 10.5 Number of Reported GBV Cases, BARMM, 2019-2022**

*[Bar Chart showing GBV Cases reported: 2019: 16, 2020: 18, 2021: 28, 2022 Q1: 11]*

The presented figure above only reflects GBV cases reported to the BWC and does not represent the overall reported cases in BARMM.

## Opportunities

**Strengthened linkages and partnerships with the UN, international non-government organizations (INGOs), CSOs, and grassroots groups.** The good relationship between the development partners and the Bangsamoro government is an opportunity to extend the coverage of the development in the region. The complementation of the peace and development programs widened the scope of the beneficiaries, thus, bridging the gaps between the intervention and the communities most affected by the conflicts. The available national and international capacity-building and development opportunities give advantage to BARMM. National and international organizations have been supporting the Bangsamoro region in its transition period and this support has been translated into a plethora of national and international capacity-building and development opportunities. Moreover, the support from national and international bodies strengthened the technical, administrative and management, and operational capacity of the BARMM MOAs, LEAs, and Security Sector.

**Convergence with other ministries and development partners.** The collaboration of ministries and development partners in working for different peace and development programs ensures a variety of peacebuilding efforts. This has resulted in different TWGs, committees, and partnerships working with different development partners.

**Supportive LGUs.** The LGUs have a key role in connecting different stakeholders and communities. The success of the activities of the different peace and development programs and projects would not be possible without the active participation of the LGUs. The LGUs implement different programs and projects in support of the attainment of national and regional goals toward peace and development.

**Established a network of peacebuilders and peacebuilding programs in Bangsamoro.** Government agencies, different development organizations, and CSOs have been at the forefront of the peacebuilding effort in the region. Through the years, these organizations have established a network of peacebuilders working for peace and development.

**National government programs on awards and incentives.** One of the strategies for the efficient and effective implementation of programs on peace and development is providing awards and incentives. In the region, LGUs undergo different evaluations and assessments of their programs on anti-illegal drugs and strengthening peace and order councils. National awards are given to the LGUs who performed satisfactorily.

**Strengthened GAD Focal Point Systems (GFPS) of BARMM MOAs.** GFPS is a mechanism established to ensure, advocate, guide, coordinate, and monitor the development, implementation, review, and updating of their GAD plans and GAD-related PPAs of BARMM MOAs. Gender violence in the region is still prevalent. However, with the GFPS, there is a dedicated team that ensures gender violence will be addressed.

**Active participation of Community Women, Youth, and IPs Organizations across BARMM.** Women, youth, and IPs play an important part in the peacebuilding process in their communities. These community-based organizations are instrumental in the implementation of different peace and development programs and projects for the rightful beneficiaries.

**Strengthened adaptability and broad areas of specialization of assets.** The LEAs have diverse specialized manpower, these agencies can provide all the necessary personnel in every situation and emergency. They can provide medical, structural, and even military support. Members of these agencies are composed of engineers, medical personnel, criminologist, and other professionals that are can be tapped in times of disaster, emergencies, or other needs.

**Available medium for multimedia mileage.** Peace and development in the region have been the subject discussed in the different multimedia platforms. Multimedia is used not only for the promotion of peace and development, but it is also used to communicate and reflect different updates on the topic. One example of how multimedia is used can be seen in the following Facebook live shows such as MPOS Hour, Bangsamoro Youth Hours, and Babae, Usap Tayo.

**Available program on cultural revitalization in settling disputes.** Alternative dispute resolution is one of the methods to settle or addresses disputes in the region. This system relies heavily on cultural and societal traditions, and beliefs. Several programs on cultural revitalization have helped in sustaining the system of ADR.

**Existence of the Memorandum of Agreement between LEAs and the security sector.** Different Memorandum of Agreement has been entered between the BARMM MOAs and LEAs and security sector. These agreements have helped in further strengthening the different programs and projects for peace and development in BARMM.

**Established special development fund (SDF) for the recovery and rehabilitation of the conflict-affected areas in the region, as mandated by the BOL.** Section 2, Article XIV of RA 11054 or the BOL states that the national government shall provide SDF to the Bangsamoro government for the rebuilding, rehabilitation, and development of its conflict-affected communities. The implementation of programs and projects funded under the SDF provides opportunities for the Bangsamoro government to fast-track the recovery and rehabilitation of the areas and communities affected by conflict.

## Priority Challenges to be Addressed in 2023-2028

### Peace and Security

One of the key challenges to be addressed in 2023 to 2028 under peace and security is the **presence of peace and other security threat groups (local threat groups, terrorist groups, and violent extremist groups).** This is caused by:

**Continue penetration of the recruitment force of violent extremist groups.** The problem regarding the penetration of the recruitment force of violent extremism groups persisted because of a lack of coordination by the AFP, LEAs, and LGUs in the implementation of the whole-of-nation approach to preventing and countering violent extremism. This was aggravated by insufficient personnel and equipment which resulted in insufficient monitoring, surveillance, and mobilization forces that could be used to track the recruitment hub and involve personalities involved in violent extremism and terrorism.

Another factor that contributes to the existence of violent extremism is less proper guidance of family members to their children or minors coupled with the use of social media by extremists to spread their misleading ideology that led the youth to be involved in violent extremism activities. Lack of education, income, and financial support for legal proceedings, weak law enforcement, and unfavorable sentence or judgment coupled with fear of persecution, preference of some members of the community to satisfy their needs, and grudges.

The problem was further aggravated by a weak recruitment policy and rampant nepotism which resulted in the hiring of incompetent personnel who are tasked to handle P/CVE. Unfunded and inefficient community awareness campaigns in P/CVE and lack of access to basic services contributed to continuing penetration of the recruitment force of violent extremist groups.

**Presence of Private Armed Groups (PAGs) and Lawless Armed Groups (LAGs).** The prevalence of PAGs and LAGs organized in the region pose terror to the communities of the BARMM. These groups are utilized for purposes of committing acts of violence and/or sowing fear and intimidation or any violations of the law for the advancement and protection of vested economic and/or political interests. Some of the prominent political personalities and families maintain PAGs as protector against their rivals. The LAGs conduct criminal acts that escalate across the region creating alarm and hampering economic activities in some areas in the BARMM.

**Porous borders.** The Sulu Archipelago measures approximately 6,100 kilometers from east to west, making it a formidable task for any single country to undertake extensive maritime enforcement. Hence, Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) brings Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines together to jointly patrol the Sulu-Celebes Sea. The weak implementation of plans and programs addressing border control in the Sulu-Celebes Sea has been the hotbed for crime, piracy, and terrorism, otherwise known as the Tri-Border Area fringed by Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Islamist terrorists have exploited the porous borders to supplement conflict zones in Southeast Asia with foreign fighters.

The weak implementation of plans and programs addressing border control in the Sulu-Celebes Sea has been the hotbed for crime, piracy, and terrorism, otherwise known as the Tri-Border Area fringed by Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Islamist terrorists have exploited the porous borders to supplement conflict zones in Southeast Asia with foreign fighters. This problem was further aggravated by less prioritization of budget, inadequate numbers of personnel and equipment, and weak implementation of border control by LEAs and AFP.

**Low appreciation of constituents for government efforts.** The slow and inadequate delivery of basic services especially in GIDAs caused by an inadequate number of personnel, equipment, and facilities coupled with untimely to un-responded societal concerns has resulted in a low appreciation of constituents to the government's efforts in P/CVE.

### Public Order and Safety

A core problem that needs to be addressed in 2023 to 2028 under public order and safety is the **Prevalence of public order and safety concerns.** This is mainly caused by:

**Persistence of rido or family feuds.** As of 2022, Lanao del Sur recorded the highest rido cases of 332 out of the 552 total rido cases in the BARMM. The existence of rido is also brought by the recurrence of the previously settled feuds. Some causes of rido or family feuds are land disputes, election-related violence, rivalry for titles, misplaced maratabat or pride, major or minor crimes committed, and other civil disputes.

**Increasing crime rates, due to the proliferation of loose firearms (LFAs), cybercrime, and other illegal activities.** In 2014, Filipinos owned an estimated 3.9 million firearms and 2.1 million or half of these are illegal. In contrast, the PNP and AFP owned less than a million guns. State forces are outgunned. Shooting incidents in BARMM stood out as a common report transmitted to the Critical Events Monitoring System (CEMS) as it tallied 424 cases for 2020 or one case a day.

**Proliferation of illegal drugs.** The presence of PAGs and other LAGs being capitalized and used by some politicians and drug lords to perpetuate their political interests and greed for money, contributed to the increasing crime rates in Bangsamoro region. This situation is aggravated when drug lords become narco-politicians. The low conviction rate and the justice system in the region particularly on drug cases could be attributed to the proliferation of illegal drugs. The illegal drug involvement of narco-politicians, and gambling (both legal and illegal) potentially prevailed in the region although it cannot be identified as a major challenge.

**High fatality rates, injuries, and severe damage to properties.** Fatality rates, injuries, and the amount of property damages are increasing at an alarming rate amidst intensified prevention and mitigation programs and activities. These are brought by the inadequate awareness of the members of the community regarding public safety, and others just do not follow safety measures at all. Furthermore, the congestion of people and households in urban areas and the adverse effect of climate change also contribute to these incidents.

Violence and crime continue to be leading causes of protracted, recurring, and massive forced displacement in the region. About 17,663 families or 88,315 individuals were displaced in 2017 from Marawi, the rest of Lanao del Sur, and other places in the region due to armed conflicts, crime, and violence, and have not been able to return to their places of origin. Of the seven reported cases of forced displacement in BARMM for the month of August 2022, six are human-induced: clan/family feuds, an armed confrontation, and a drug raid. Only one was due to a natural disaster.

### Peacebuilding

A core problem that needs to be addressed under this sub-sector within 2023 to 2028 is the **Volatile peace conditions in the region.** This is associated with the following:

**Unsatisfactory implementation of peace agreements particularly on the normalization track.** One of the important aspects of the peace process is the Normalization track that includes the decommissioning of MILF combatants. Undeniably, the said combatants have played vital roles in the quest of the Bangsamoro people for the right to self-determination which resulted in the establishment of the BARMM. Unfortunately, the decommissioning process has been mired by several challenges, including the ambiguity of the source of the decommissioning package and the slow pace of the process itself, among others. So far, only the cash component amounting to One Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php100,000.00) has been received by those who have already been decommissioned. Many of those combatants have yet to be decommissioned. Moreover, not all MILF combatants are included in the list of those to be decommissioned. Meaning, even assuming that the decommissioning process is completed, there will be numerous combatants who would not be decommissioned. Further, there is rampant misinformation on the decommissioning process and perceived little impact of the implementation of programs in their respective communities.

These problems pose a serious threat not only to the success of the peace process but also to the safety and security of the people of the region. There are several reports to the effect that some disgruntled combatants have already joined, or are in the process of joining, violent extremist groups such as Maute-ISIS and BIFF. On the other hand, some combatants expressed their desire to stay in camps or the forests either due to their exclusion from the normalization or due to their dissatisfaction with how the peace process itself is working.

In this respect, it is worthy to emphasize that the Bangsamoro people have been undergoing protracted peace processes from the MNLF to the MILF - from 1975 to the present to be exact, or for almost 50 years. Although a lot of positive gains have been so far achieved, there are perceived lapses in the process of implementation. For this reason, it is not unlikely that some peace spoilers or dissatisfied individuals or groups might exploit the negative consequences of the delay and unsatisfactory implementation of the peace agreements to advance their personal, ideological, or political agenda. Hence, meaningful programs for former combatants, including peacebuilding training and capacity development, should be among the priorities of the Bangsamoro government.

**Neglect of marginalized and vulnerable sectors and institutions.** There are several groups, institutions, and individuals calling for programs or interventions for marginalized and vulnerable sectors as an effective means of P/CVE. However, the terms 'marginalized' and 'vulnerable' seem to have become overused to refer to almost all sectors, such as women, youth, elderly, poor, widows, and disabled, among others. Consequently, the factual marginalized and vulnerable sectors, such as widows and orphans of rebels or violent extremists, among others, have been overlooked in P/CVE interventions. It must be emphasized in this respect that several orphans of violent extremists have also become members of violent extremist groups as in the case of the "Ajang-ajang" in Sulu who are children of slain Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) members.

On the other hand, it has been claimed that some Madrasahs or Islamic schools were made breeding or recruitment grounds by violent extremist groups. This allegation has created reactions from the Muslim communities. Whether this claim is true or not, there is a need to address the gap concerning these institutions, such as the inadequacy of support, if any, coming from the government. To give an example, there are Asatidz or religious teachers who are teaching in Madrasahs every Saturday and Sunday but receive only a meager amount of money (Php500.00 to Php3,000.00 a month) even though most of them have graduated from Islamic schools locally or abroad.

Another is the case of active Madrasahs with dilapidated buildings and no basic facilities and equipment such as tables, chairs, and black/white boards. Cases like these are very common in remote areas and if you compare these Madrasahs to typical schools, you will easily recognize the discrepancy in the support they are receiving from the government. For instance, there are several vacant school buildings in different areas of the region. There are also places where a school building is used as Madrasah on Fridays and Saturdays. In terms of marginalization and vulnerability to violent extremism, therefore, these sectors and institutions could be at the top of the list due to their neglected conditions.

**Inadequacy and poor implementation of programs for returning local insurgents or violent extremists and their dependents.** For several decades, the Bangsamoro homeland has been devastated by terrorism or violent extremism. For instance, the island provinces of Basilan and Sulu had experienced their darkest moments in the past during the reign of terror of the ASG.

News of kidnappings and beheadings were usually dominating local and international print and broadcast media and other communication channels. Also, some Philippine Presidents attempted to eradicate the group but failed tremendously. Former President Joseph Estrada even uttered publicly that "pupulbusin ko kayo (I will destroy you, referring to ASG)". Unfortunately, he was ousted from his post without any significant success against the ASG.

In the case of Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur, the BIFF, Maute-ISIS, and other extremist groups continue to be a big threat to the safety and security of those areas. One example is the 2017 Marawi Siege that displaced about three hundred thousand and claimed the lives of more than one thousand individuals, among other damages. Fortunately, it has been observed that the number of surrendering ASG, BIFF, Maute-ISIS, and other violent extremists continue to increase in recent years. This influx of rebel returnees could be due to several reasons, one of which is the government's promise for livelihood, financial, and other assistance for those who will choose to return to the folds of the law. After all, studies suggest that most of those joining extremist and other lawless groups are motivated by monetary considerations.

However, several former local insurgents expressed their disappointment with how the programs for them are being implemented. For instance, they are claiming that what was promised to them, such as housing, livelihood, and other assistance has not been received by them until now leaving them still poor, marginalized, and neglected. Worse, they could not easily reintegrate into mainstream society and resume a peaceful life due to the stigma of being a former member of violent extremist groups.

For this reason, several reports suggesting that some of them returned to being members of such groups. It is for this reason that peacebuilding interventions to sustain the influx of surrendering violent extremists and provide sustainable programs for them and their dependents become imperative if only to establish an enduring peace in the region.

**Inadequacy of peacebuilding interventions to address factors contributing to volatile peace and security in BARMM.** The peace and security condition of BARMM, although improving in recent years as a result mainly of the peace process, has remained unstable and unpredictable. Several factors are contributing to this condition such as the perceived culture of violence, religious intolerance, tribalism, maratabat, and other negative practices or culture.

On the other hand, the absence of positive peace in most areas of the region aggravates the situation. For instance, disrespect for human dignity and values; lack of equal access to resources, services, and opportunities for government positions; extreme poverty; and poor governance, among others, are prevalent in the different areas of the region. These problems continue to hamper any effort for lasting peace and development in the region, thus, must be addressed accordingly.

**Continued displacement of Most Affected Area (MAA) residents of Marawi City.** The MRP is yet to be completed. Many of the MAA residents have not been able to return to their area due to different factors such as lack of housing and rehabilitation in Marawi City. The IDPs of the Marawi siege have been uprooted from their home since 2017, the longest IDPs being displaced.

### Human Rights

The core problem under this sub-sector is the **rampant human rights violation.** This problem is caused by:

**Low knowledge, skills, and attitude on human rights among primary duty bearers.** Central to the idea of human rights is establishing and sustaining the relationship between the rights-holder and the duty-bearer. The duty-bearers have the obligation and responsibility to protect, promote, and fulfill human rights. However, their capacity to uphold human rights is hindered due to a lack of human rights knowledge, skills, attitude, and awareness.

The lack of awareness among corrections officers in some jail detention facilities in BARMM, for instance, denies the PDLs of their rights such as proper nutrition and a healthy lifestyle, in addition to being held in overcrowded cells. According to BJMP-BARMM, these difficulties are mainly because of the lack of financial resources to implement and comply with human rights enshrined in local and international laws and standards.

**Limited access to the justice system.** Another challenge is limited access to the justice system. At the outset, while peacekeeping institutions and human rights agencies are present, this limited access to the justice system is due largely to the existence of the culture of silence at the community level. Despite the prevalence of human rights issues, people do not report them to the institutions and/or agencies concerned, making it difficult for human rights institutions such as the BHRC to address them. According to the results of an IDP Forum, displaced individuals whose human rights have been transgressed may be aware of justice mechanisms but are unsure of the extent of support to the reported cases.

Perhaps this limited access to the justice system is also due to the people's preconceived notion of the selective justice system in the country. Many people, especially the Bangsamoro people, are under the impression that justice is only for the rich. However, what they fail to see is that there is already a Bangsamoro government that takes care of them. There are already ministries, offices, and agencies that render services that they can avail of in times of need. The BHRC, for instance, has a program on financial and legal assistance to the victims of human rights violations and abuses, as well as their families which the people can avail of. Nevertheless, there are still so many communities within BARMM that are suffering from poverty. Hence, the Bangsamoro government still has a lot of work to do to address this concern.

**Insufficient awareness of human rights.** One of the challenges and reasons why human rights cases remain an issue in our communities is because there is a lack of sufficient human rights awareness on the part of the people at large. While ignorance may be bliss, it is not the case concerning human rights. The more there is a lack of awareness, the more the tendency for human rights violations to exist. On the positive note, to develop a human right conscious Bangsamoro society, where people are more aware of their rights, can mitigate cases of human rights abuses and violations, and those who are likely to violate these inherent rights would be more prudent and inclined not to do so since people are already empowered.

Moreover, if there is sufficient awareness of human rights, more resources will be supported to implement human rights advocacies, programs, projects, and activities. The lack of access to basic education, poverty, weak access to social services especially in far-flung areas, and many others, will be addressed.

Also, the lack of human rights desks at the barangay level contributes largely to this challenge. If human rights desks are placed within the reach of the people in their respective communities, the reporting of human rights cases and/or issues will be easily facilitated and provided with solutions. Consequently, it would then be easier for human rights institutions to penetrate these communities and conduct advocacies, programs, projects, and activities intended to make people aware of their basic rights.

The weak access to social services, especially in GIDA, deprived the constituents of sufficient awareness of human rights due to excessive poverty and geographic placement, even noting their lack of information about their rights.

The Bangsamoro region is experiencing an increasing number of situations where women's rights are being violated due to a lack of gender perspective in justice, security, and peace. Violence against women, human trafficking, and rape, among others, are some of the occurrences monitored by the BWC and BHRC, two agencies that are champions of upholding their rights and eliminating all forms of violation and discrimination. Furthermore, other apparent cases recorded, such as GBV and child early and forced marriages, are due to poverty.

The insufficient participation of women in armed conflict security, peace, and development process is among the contributory factors to the insufficient awareness of human rights in terms of inclusion of women, youth, and children concerned with security, peace, and development.

#### Human Rights

**Bangsamoro Human Rights Action Center Program.** The Barangay Human Rights Action Centers (BHRAC) program is an initiative taken by the BHRC to ensure that human rights is spread and preserved at the community level. In principle, the BHRAC program is established to increase the reach of the CHR to the populace, in completion of its mandate of promoting and protecting human rights. The barangay, according to the Local Government Code is "the basic political unit serving as the primary implementing unit of government policies, plans, programs, projects, and activities in the community and as a forum wherein the collective views of the people may be expressed, crystallized and considered, and where disputes may be amicably settled." As such, the BHRC has tapped the grassroots to ensure that human rights services are made accessible to the populace and are embedded in the community culture of the Bangsamoro.

Through this program, the Bangsamoro government may partner with concerned institutions, community organizations, and other groups to deliver its message and engage the public in meaningful conversations about human rights. Another important aspect program is its advocacy efforts through engaging with government officials and policymakers to promote laws and policies that support human rights and to hold those who violate these rights accountable. Through its advocacy work, the center seeks to bring about lasting change that will have a positive impact on people's lives.

**Witness Protection Program.** This program is consist of, among others, the provision of security, shelter, relocation, and financial assistance to witnesses and their families to secure their attendance in investigations being conducted by the Commission and to ensure the production and preservation of the integrity of evidence. This initiative offers help to persons who had observed or were victims of human rights abuses, giving them a safe environment to live, work and recuperate from the trauma they had endured. The program provides counseling services, legal representation, and financial support, allowing witnesses to start a new life free from fear. This initiative may inspire many others to come forward and speak out against human rights violations. The human rights witness protection program will provide a crucial safety net for those who were willing to stand up for what is right, even in the face of danger, helping to ensure that justice will be served. Every case that is successfully handled serves as evidence and demonstration of courage and the goodness of humanity, and the value of protecting those who are prepared to speak up against injustice in the hope of bringing about a better society.

**Human Rights Protection Program.** The Bangsamoro administration is adamant about taking a crucial part in the ongoing struggle for human rights, fighting to make sure that everyone can live in dignity, safety, and freedom. This program is vital in promoting and defending the fundamental rights and freedoms of Bangsamoro people, regardless of their tribe, gender, or religion. It is essential in raising awareness about human rights abuses and holding those responsible accountable for their actions. Human rights protection services are those that are designed to compel duty-bearers to fulfill, respect, and protect human rights and peoples from violations and abuses.

One of the key priorities of this program is to bring attention to the plight of marginalized and vulnerable communities who were most at risk of human rights abuses. This included indigenous peoples, refugees and asylum seekers, women and children, and people living in conflict zones. The organization also worked to promote the rights of individuals who were subjected to arbitrary detention, torture, and other forms of ill-treatment.

**Human Rights Promotion Program.** The goals of the program for promoting human rights are to increase awareness and encourage the respect and defense of those rights. This program can be implemented by government agencies in partnership with other institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations, and other civil society groups.

Human rights promotion initiatives are those that empower individuals, groups, or peoples to assert and claim their human rights, and enable duty-bearers to comply with their obligations. The focus of human rights promotion programs can vary, but some common goals include education and raising awareness among people about their rights and responsibilities through organizing workshops, seminars, and other educational events; capacity building of local organizations and individuals to effectively promote and defend human rights; monitoring and reporting programs about human rights abuses and reporting them to relevant authorities or the public; and advocacy efforts aimed at promoting human rights at all LGU levels, establishments, and institutions by working with decision-makers to adopt laws and policies that better protect human rights, as well as raising awareness among the public about human rights issues.

Overall, the goal of human rights promotion programs is to create a more just and equitable world where everyone's rights are respected and protected.

**Promotion of Indigenous People's Rights and Legal Aid.** This program is composed of four projects: Legal Assistance, Paralegal Training/Workshop; Information Drive and Free Legal Assistance; Empowering Indigenous Peoples' Youth as Advocates and Defendants of IP Rights (IPYAD); Indigenous Peoples' Peacekeeping Force and Responder (IPPFR).

**Indigenous Lands for Indigenous Peoples' Aiming for Development (iLIPAD) Program.** This program will fully materialize many development and security programs for the Indigenous People in the Bangsamoro Region. This will address the following issues such as the lack of strong Intergovernmental coordination between National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) and MIPA, as well as other BARMM agencies like MENRE and MAFAR with regards to ancestral domain issues; the weak basis that can be used for ancestral domain concerns and interventions; no clear partnership with the security sector in protecting IP claimants and ancestral domains; no formal Ancestral Domain Comprehensive and Sustainable Development Plan; insufficient community assemblies/workshops for the identification of ancestral domains; and social preparation procedures of the delineation of identified ancestral domains. This program consists of the following projects: Ancestral Domain Driven Development (A3Ds) Project, Indigenous Peoples Protection (i3Ps) Project, and Féfégétuwan (Information Education Communication) Project.
