# Chapter 2: Regional trends and prospects for development

The next six years will hold several challenges for the BARMM as it navigates a critical transition period until 2025, while attempting to sustain the dividends of peace amidst tackling the hurdles brought by COVID-19 and the broader development challenges.

Several trends and developments at the global and regional levels have and may affect the region as well. It is therefore imperative that the Bangsamoro government takes these current and emerging trends into account when charting its development directions for the next six years.

As the BARMM works towards achieving an empowered, cohesive, and progressive Bangsamoro, it will have to strategically navigate through the political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental landscapes.

## Population and Demography

### Trends

#### The highest population growth rate from 2015 to 2020

BARMM has a total population of 4,944,800 based on the 2020 Census of Population and Housing (CPH), accounting for approximately 4.04 percent of the Philippine population in 2020. In addition to the 2020 BARMM population are the population of Cotabato City (325,079), as well as the SGA (215,433).

BARMM's 2020 population increased by 622,901 from 3.78 million in 2015 and is 1.15 million higher than the population of 3.26 million in 2010. Over a decade, BARMM's population grew by 1.60 million.

From 2015 to 2020, the population of BARMM increased at a rate of 3.26 percent, making it the fastest growing region in the Philippines. By comparison, the region's population grew at a lower rate from 2010 to 2015 at 2.89 percent and 1.51 percent between 2000 and 2010.

Among the BARMM provinces, Maguindanao recorded the largest population (1,342,179), followed by Lanao del Sur (1,195,518), Sulu (1,000,108), Tawi-Tawi (440,276), and Basilan (426,207).

#### Greater female population at working ages (15-64 years) in the BARMM as of 2020

In 2020, 2.79 million people are of working age, of whom 1,405,127 are female and 1,387,765 are male. It can be noted that there are more females of working age than males. In addition, there are a total of 2.04 million individuals under the age of 15 (young dependents), among which 1.0 million are females and 1.03 million are males. In the household population over 65, there are only over 100 thousand people, 50,328 females and 50,361 males.

#### 7.9 million more people in BARMM by 2030, with the greatest increase in Lanao del Sur

BARMM's population is projected to reach 5,250,500 by 2030. This indicates a 1,986,400 increase in the population of the region in ten years.

### Table 2.3 BARMM Projected Population 2010-2030

| REGION | 2010 | 2015 | 2020 | 2025 | 2030 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Philippines | 93,135,100 | 101,562,300 | 109,947,900 | 117,959,400 | 125,337,500 |

*Source: PSA, 2010 Census-Based Population Projections*

Throughout the projection period (2010-2030), the population of the six provinces of BARMM would continue to increase, albeit at a slower rate. Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao del Norte and del Sur, and Sulu will contain more than 1 million people and have the largest populations by 2030, with 1.5 million, 1.4 million, and 1.1 million persons, respectively, by 2030. Populations of Tawi-Tawi and Basilan are expected to reach 588,500 and 497,900, respectively, in the said period.

#### Projected rapid growth of the working-age population

Overall, the projected population in BARMM from 2010 to 2030 will increase across broad age groups. Ages 0 to 14 will have a gradual but consistent growth in population over the projection period. By 2030, the number of people in this age group will increase to 1,843,400, a rise of approximately 457,000 individuals.

BARMM's working-age population (15-64 years old) is also expected to grow, reaching 3.2 million in 2030. This is an increase of 1.4 million people compared to 2010.

Moreover, the number of people in BARMM aged 65 and older is projected to expand four-fold, representing a jump from 53,500 individuals in 2010 to 202,200 in 2030. While the number of people within this age group is expected to increase continuously, it will not be able to keep up with the rapidly growing number of people of the working age. The number of women in BARMM between the ages of 15 and 49 is expected to show a consistent growth pattern, going from 838,000 in 2010 to 1,355,200 in 2030.

### Table 2.5 BARMM Projected Population by Selected Age Group, 2010-2030

| REGION | 2010 | 2015 | 2020 | 2025 | 2030 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pop 0-14 | 1,386,400 | 1,461,800 | 1,580,100 | 1,741,400 | 1,843,400 |
| Pop 15-64 | 1,824,200 | 2,173,900 | 2,517,600 | 2,839,600 | 3,204,900 |
| Pop 65 & over | 53,500 | 71,200 | 98,700 | 138,000 | 202,200 |

*Source: PSA, 2010 Census-Based Population Projections*

Among the BARMM provinces, Lanao del Sur is projected to register the largest increase in the working-age population by 2030, growing from 512,100 in 2010 to 941,900. Maguindanao comes next and is projected to gain 913,600 in its working-age population throughout the projection period, followed by Sulu at 686,200.

Tawi-Tawi and Basilan are expected to experience slow but steady growth. Approximately 364,900 people will be working-age in Tawi-Tawi by 2030 from 210,500 in 2010. Over the next 20 years, Sulu will gain 264,900 people aged 15-64 years, growing from 421,300 in 2010 to 686,200 in 2030.

### Prospects

#### Reaping the demographic dividend

BARMM is well positioned for accelerated economic growth and social development as a result of the high percentage of its population in the working age group (15-64 years old) in 2020. The population projections (2010 to 2030) also signify the potential for BARMM to reap a demographic dividend.

The region's economic growth potential will likely be very high if this projected population growth is realized, especially for the working-age population, as there will be a greater number of people in the workforce relative to the number of dependents.

To reap the full benefits of a favorable age distribution, the Bangsamoro government must invest further in human capital development by assuring access to health care and quality education for all ages, as well as increasing opportunities for productive employment and decent labor.

## Political

### Trends

#### New leadership making headways

The Bangsamoro government is confronted with enormous challenges in setting up the necessary structures, processes, and mechanisms to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of services to the Bangsamoro. With a complex transition process, combined with the compounding effects of COVID-19, tackling the region's development challenges is doubly difficult for BARMM as a fledgling government.

Building a bureaucracy is not an easy task; however, the Bangsamoro government has been making significant strides in institution building. The Bangsamoro government has doubled its efforts to operationalize the newly established offices and fill key positions within the government. Subsequently, developing the capacities of new civil servants and newly established institutions will be a high priority for the new leadership. This is a critical component of this effort to cultivate effective public service.

#### Moral governance as an instrumentality for inclusion, equity, and justice

It has been a central component of the Bangsamoro government's efforts to create a more empowered, cohesive, and progressive Bangsamoro that has always put moral governance as a critical underpinning principle to ensure inclusivity, equity, and justice within the Bangsamoro.

#### Shift in the system of governance

The birth of this new political entity faced various challenges. Most notably, changes in government structures and political leadership. The ARMM adopted a unitary government system. However, with the change in political entity following the ratification of the BOL, the Bangsamoro government has adopted a parliamentary system in running the BARMM. As mentioned above, the Bangsamoro government is continuously strengthening its effort in establishing this new political structure.

#### Policy support in relation to fiscal autonomy in-place

According to Section 1, Article XII of the BOL, "The Bangsamoro Government shall enjoy fiscal autonomy with the end in view of attaining economic self-sufficiency and genuine development." This means that the Bangsamoro government has the power to create its own sources of revenue in addition to the equitable share in the national taxes from the national government and block grant and prepare its budget and allocate this revenue within the bounds of the BOL. The Bangsamoro government has now the power to pass annual regional appropriations law through the Parliament in accordance with the needs and priorities of the region.

Through the annual block grant, the national government can automatically provide a sum equal to 5 percent of the net national internal revenue tax collections generated by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and the Bureau of Customs (BOC). This is the fiscal autonomy granted to the Bangsamoro government to control over its appropriations.

In addition to the annual block grant, the Bangsamoro government's taxing powers have also been expanded. It shall have the power to levy taxes, fees, and charges, but are subject to provisions of the Organic Law. Other than tariff and customs duties, the Bangsamoro government shares in national government taxes, fees, and charges collected in the BARMM are increased to 75 percent, inclusive of the shares of its constituent LGUs.

#### LGUs' functionality and performance demonstrating progress

During the start of a transition of leadership from ARMM to BARMM, LGUs' functionality was recorded at 45 percent (or 56 LGUs) of the 123 LGUs in ARMM. The Ministry of Interior and Local Government (MILG) has strategized its implementation of PPAs that include the giving of incentives to performing local governments. The tool used by the ministry was the Performance Audit and Compliance Tracking System (PACTS).

In 2021, the functionality rate jumped to 80 percent, which is equivalent to 98 LGUs. This remarkable increase shows that the strategy of incentivizing the performing LGUs is a good way of enticing others to do the same. Incentives were given in the form of a project amounting to Php1.5 million. A menu of projects was also given for the performing LGUs to choose from such as support to social, education, revenue generation, and disaster-related projects.

The ministry treated it as its regular program that serves as a support mechanism to the Seal of Good Local Governance (SGLG) being implemented by the DILG. The BARMM recorded 28 LGUs as passers in the prestigious search for SGLG, making the region ranked 1st out of the six regions in Mindanao and ranked 3rd out of 17 regions in the Philippines that passed and awarded with SGLG.

### Prospects

#### The Bangsamoro Electoral Code and democratic process in BARMM

There is much anticipation about the passage of the Bangsamoro Electoral Code, which is perceived to pave the way for a more democratic and credible system of electoral processes in BARMM to ensure genuine, credible, free, open, and honest elections.

#### Towards a more stable and stronger bureaucracy

In the coming years, BARMM will be seeing a stable and stronger governance system with the amount of progress made and the continuing effort to build and strengthen the bureaucracy.

#### Policy support to harness revenue generation needed

BARMM's revenue generation capacity will be boosted by the passage of the Bangsamoro Revenue Code. It shall cover the taxing powers of the Bangsamoro government. The BARMM is optimistic that this Code will act as a catalyst for boosting revenue collection and enhancing the overall revenue generation, thereby contributing to the improvement of the quality of the delivery of services in the region.

#### Well-defined relationship between BARMM and its constituent LGUs

The Bangsamoro Local Government Code shall strengthen the supervisory powers of the Bangsamoro government through the MILG and provide clear guidance on the relationship between the Bangsamoro government and its constituent LGUs.

Through this proposed Code, it is expected that the Bangsamoro government will develop a more responsive and accountable local governments in the region.

#### Implementation of the Mandanas-Garcia ruling poses opportunities and challenges

The implementation of the Mandanas-Garcia ruling in BARMM will equip LGUs with more resources to implement its devolved functions. However, the implementation should be accompanied with a range of capacity development support in terms of the structure, policies, skills, mechanisms, and systems and processes.

#### Strong support of national government and international development partners

The BARMM is strongly supported by the national government and international development partners in its efforts for institutionalization and socioeconomic development. Their assistance has significant contribution in BARMM's efforts toward a peaceful transition.

The national government has been a major player in the process of achieving long-term peace in the BARMM. Peace dividends have been sustained due to the joint efforts of the GPH and the MILF. The ongoing decommissioning of MILF combatants, which is one of the key provisions of the Annex on Normalization of the CAB, is a specific indication of strengthened partnership between the GPH and the MILF.

The development partners have also played an important role as knowledge and resource brokers, allowing the BARMM to bring together relevant stakeholders from the international, national, and local levels to promote sustainable and inclusive peace and development in the Bangsamoro region. The Bangsamoro government was heavily supported by development partners in charting its development direction through their assistance during BARMM's delicate transition. Also, the development partners have contributed in the region's response and recovery efforts to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Economic

### Trends

#### Second fastest-growing economy in the country

The ARMM experienced the highest economic growth in 2017, registered at 10.1 percent. However, the region's economic performance decelerated in 2018 and 2019 at 7.7 percent and 5.8 percent, respectively. Though the economy of ARMM was growing, the region had the lowest contribution to the overall economic output of the country due to the nature of its economic base, being a producer of raw materials.

According to the PSA, the economy of the BARMM decelerated from a positive rate in 2019 of 5.8 percent to -1.9 percent in 2020. However, the regional economy strongly recovered in 2021, registering a 7.5 percent increase, the second highest growth rate in the country. The region's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate was mainly fueled by AFF at 8.3 percent, industry at 7.9 percent, and services at 6.6 percent.

However, it should be noted that BARMM, which is still in transition, continues to make minimal economic contribution despite its positive economic development. The region's share of the national economy averaged at 1.0 percent between 2010 and 2018, making it the smallest region's share of the country's overall economic performance.

#### Bigger role of industry and services

Over the last two decades, structural changes have been observed. In 2021, the services sector replaced AFF as the leading sector, accounting for 36.40 percent of the region's overall economic output. The industry sector has also seen a dramatic rise from 8.13 percent in 2000 to 24.70 percent in 2021.

However, this does not mean that the AFF has weakened in recent years. AFF remains to be one of the most important sub-sectors in the economic sector. It played a major role in the economic resiliency of the region at the time of the pandemic. It remains to be the main source of food, employment, and income of most of the Bangsamoro households. This only indicates that the region is heading towards a balanced economy. Industry and services are now playing a bigger role and contribute significantly to the region's economic output.

#### Idle land assets and untapped tourism and investment potentials

BARMM sees numerous opportunities to revitalize the region's economy, owing to its abundant natural resources and diverse rural topography, which includes vast tracts of fertile land and marine resources. BARMM is also endowed with natural landscapes and environment, beaches, historical landmarks, and sceneries comparable to known tourist destinations in the Philippines. It has a wide range of flora and fauna, pristine white sandy-beaches, crystalline spring water and towering waterfalls, and a variety of tourist attractions.

Due to this competitive advantage, the Bangsamoro region is viewed as a viable source for producing goods or services at a lower opportunity cost than its trading counterparts. A growing tourism industry is also emerging in BARMM. The Bangsamoro government is making unprecedented investments in tourism. The opening of an inter-regional airline route between Cotabato City and Bongao in Tawi-Tawi province marks an important milestone in promoting tourism in the region.

### Prospects

#### Agriculture development to move at a faster rate

The AFF sector is expected to grow at a faster rate as more lands will be opened for agricultural investments and industry players will have better access to technology, market information, and government support.

#### Expanding industry and services sectors

Construction, real estate, trade, tourism, and investment are perceived as the sunrise industries in the region as the gains in the peace process and overall regional stability will boost investors' confidence.

#### Halal industry growing and expanding markets

Halal industry development is viewed as a very promising investment opportunity. The BARMM is a potential market for Halal-compliant products due to its large Muslim population. The region is also geographically well-situated due to its proximity to most major cities in Mindanao, its access to international maritime routes, and its strategic location along the Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) trade corridor.

#### Islamic finance as a component driver of socioeconomic development

The pursuit of an operational and functional Islamic finance system in the Philippines remains as important and urgent. The current financial system, which is still largely fueled by interest-based and conventional transactions and instruments, does not conform to the needs, identity, aspirations, and way of life of the Bangsamoro.

With this, some Bangsamoro and other Muslim Filipinos were not able to participate in the financial system as exemplified by the very low rate of financial inclusion across the region. This means that a vast number of constituents in the BARMM are excluded from accessing useful and affordable financial products and services that are supposed to meet their needs and improve their overall quality of life.

Cognizant of the pressing need to provide an alternative financial system that is responsive to the needs and aspirations of the Bangsamoro, and recognizing the importance of establishing Islamic finance as a component driver of socioeconomic development, the OCM issued Memorandum Circular No. 0012 in 2021 creating a technical working group for Islamic finance in the BARMM. It primarily aims to develop a roadmap for the comprehensive promotion and development of Islamic finance in the region. This was followed by the issuance of Joint Circular dated 26 April 2022 and a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) dated 04 May 2022 between the Bangsamoro government, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMEF), and the Department of Finance on establishing the Shari'ah Supervisory Board in the BARMM.

In creating the enabling environment for the Islamic finance industry, the Bangsamoro government develops the roadmap for the promotion and development of Islamic finance in the region. It offers a workable and grounded framework intended mainly to serve as a guide in designing the region's Islamic finance development and strategic pathways in a manner that supports and fits seamlessly into bigger socioeconomic development trajectories and objectives. It also lays the foundations for the continuing and sustainability-oriented directions for stakeholders, industry, and inter-governmental dialogue, cooperation, and collaboration.

As part of its holistic approach, the roadmap's strategic thrusts are designed for the Islamic financial services providers, consumers and end users, government regulators, and environment enablers. This translates to interventions that will establish and institutionalize Islamic banks, Islamic microfinance, Islamic pawn brokering or "ar-rahnu", Islamic insurance or "takaful", and the Islamic capital market. Moreover, "zakah", "waqf", and "hajj" financing are important complementary industries and services to the overall development of an Islamic finance ecosystem. Cross-cutting strategies will include the development of human capital, and institutional, regulatory, and market environment.

#### Tighter BIMP-EAGA economic integration

The economic integration through the BIMP-EAGA opens up opportunities for trade and investment. Advancing BARMM's integration in the BIMP-EAGA trade window has been regarded as a means of stimulating its development as a strategic player, as well as increasing its economic competitiveness within Mindanao and the BIMP-EAGA region.

In June 2022, the MinDA and the Bangsamoro government through the BPDA inked a Memorandum of Cooperation aimed at fostering stronger partnership and collaboration to scale up efforts towards more robust participation of BARMM in the BIMP-EAGA and other Mindanao development initiatives. This collaboration is also seen as advancing long-term peace and development across Mindanao and BARMM.

To pursue this integration to the BIMP-EAGA, the BARMM and the national government must promote sustainable and competitive cross-border trading and trade investments, increase strategic infrastructure including digital connectivity, develop value chains for priority commodities with high trade and processing potential, mainstream sustainable and climate-resilient resource management, and strengthen partnerships for knowledge exchange and capacity building.

## Social

### Trends

#### Low human development index but gradual improvement in accessing health and education services

BARMM has the lowest human development index (HDI) in the country, particularly on the performance outcomes in the areas of health and education as well as standard of living. The HDI for BARMM was the lowest of all the regions in 2017. BARMM's score on HDI in 2019 was categorized as medium human development, which is also the lowest in the Philippines. The three provinces with the lowest HDI or low human development in the country are all from BARMM namely, Sulu, Maguindanao, and Lanao del Sur.

#### Historic drop in poverty but remains to be the highest in the country

Poverty remains a major challenge in the region. Poverty incidence in the ARMM continues to rise from 55.8 percent in 2012 to 53.7 percent in 2015. Among the regions of the country, ARMM registered the highest poverty incidence at 61.3 percent in 2018. This rate is almost four times the national poverty incidence posted at 16.6 percent in 2018. The three provinces of the ARMM namely, Sulu, Basilan, and Lanao del Sur, were among the poorest provinces in the country in 2018.

BARMM's poverty incidence plummeted to 29.80 percent in 2021 as compared to 54.20 percent in 2018. However, this rate is still high when compared to the national poverty incidence posted at 23.7 percent in 2021.

#### Gains in overall regional peace and security but threats remain a concern

In recent years, the region has seen sporadic violence, particularly in relation to horizontal armed conflicts like clan feuds/"rido" and other forms of violence such as organized crime, and gender-based violence, among others. There is still a threat to the region's peace, public order, and security. Therefore, strategic efforts to prevent and counter violent extremism, formation of private armies, rise in number of crimes, and other types of threat and violence in the region should remain a top priority.

In addition, efforts to build peace should be directed toward addressing the causes and factors that contribute to instability to lessen the likelihood of the occurrence of violent conflict. COVID-19 also came at a critical time in BARMM's transition period, adding another layer of challenges to the Bangsamoro government's peacebuilding efforts.

#### Normalization process has been sluggish

In 2014, the MILF and the GPH reached a peace deal through the signing of the CAB. Normalization is an important component of the peace process as outlined in the CAB. The Annex on Normalization defines normalization as the process by which communities can attain their desired quality of life, including sustainable livelihood and political participation within a peaceful deliberative society.

Little progress has been observed in the implementation of the normalization process and its essential components, including but not limited to the deployment of peacekeeping teams to bolster conflict mitigation efforts, Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC), the decommissioning of MILF combatants, and confidence building measures such as amnesty and pardon and transformation of the six MILF-acknowledged camps into peaceful and productive communities.

There was a relatively positive start to the normalization process, but COVID-19 has significantly slowed it down over the past years. Efforts to reintegrate former combatants have been hindered by the pandemic by limiting the already scarce funding for Normalization and restricting the mobility of implementers, particularly in the implementation of the socioeconomic programs for decommissioned MILF members and their communities.

#### Camp transformation has yet to be realized but will soon get underway

Camp transformation, a critical aspect of Normalization as noted above, has so far remained largely unfulfilled. In spite of this, a funding mechanism has already been established to support the process of normalization, so it will be possible to move forward with the implementation phase in the following months.

The Bangsamoro Normalization Trust Fund (BNTF), which had its official launch in 2021 will finance, coordinate, and oversee the delivery of assistance from international partners and other donors during the implementation of the normalization process. This assistance will primarily be used for development efforts as well as the rehabilitation, reconstruction, and development of Bangsamoro communities, particularly six previously acknowledged MILF Camps (Abubakar, Omar, Badre, Rajamuda, Bushra, and Bilal), as well as vulnerable sectors across BARMM.

#### Recovery in COVID-19 pandemic

BARMM is not immune to the negative repercussions of COVID-19, especially since the pandemic has struck at a critical juncture in the region's transition period. While the region is still reeling from the negative effects of the pandemic, BARMM is also addressing the challenges brought on by the transition period. COVID-19 has posed a direct challenge to the peace and development in the region by straining the Bangsamoro government's peacebuilding efforts, driving up competition for scarce resources in localities with historical tension, and shifting institutional focus away from building inclusive policies during the formative stage of the region's new administrative apparatus.

The BARMM, like the rest of the Philippines, has been developing strategies to recover faster from the COVID-19 pandemic and address the substantial disruptions it caused. As part of the Bangsamoro Response and Recovery Plan (BRRP) on COVID-19 (2020-2022), the Bangsamoro government outlined critical strategies, including how the government will mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, facilitate adaptation to a new normal, and support gradual socioeconomic recovery over the three years.

As stated in the BRRP, the Bangsamoro government will encourage a whole-of-government approach as well as the convergence of efforts in the implementation of priority PPAs such as intensification of health-care services, strengthening social protection mechanisms, improving livelihood support, sustaining the food supply-chain, ensuring continuity of educational opportunities, and improving the region's adaptive capacity to the current crisis, among others.

### Prospects

#### Significant improvements in education and health performance

Access to education and health services is expected to improve significantly due to greater public investments in education and health and improved capacities of the MBHTE, MOH, and LGUs. Improved research capacities, particularly the use of data, will result in the deliberate targeting of unserved and underserved communities.

#### Declining trend in poverty

Two years have passed since COVID-19 swept the globe, but the pandemic is by no means over. COVID-19 is as much a social and economic crisis as it is a health crisis, yet one thing is certain: it has affected all segments of society with the most severe consequences falling on the marginalized and vulnerable. As we have witnessed, COVID-19 has disproportionately affected the poor and vulnerable who have borne the brunt of the damage.

Our government's efforts to combat poverty have been hampered by COVID-19. According to a study conducted by the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), the pandemic would make it more difficult for the Philippines to reduce poverty and return to its pre-pandemic growth path. But despite this setback, the implementation of poverty alleviation programs has continued, and our government has been ensuring that services were delivered to the basic sectors during the pandemic.

In the case of BARMM, poverty reduction is the most important success story in the region. All of the BARMM government's efforts to reduce poverty are starting to bear fruit, despite the challenges that have been brought about by the region's transition, as well as the pandemic's compounded effects. It is remarkable to note that the BARMM has seen a huge decrease in poverty incidence over the last three years, from 54.20 percent in 2018 to 29.8 percent in 2021. Thus, the region recorded the greatest percentage drop among the regions in the Philippines.

In spite of achieving this significant milestone, BARMM still has the highest poverty incidence among the regions in the country. This entails that the region must scale-up its efforts to ensure that anti-poverty programs and interventions are holistic by means of integrating the necessary social protection components especially for those in need.

As BARMM moves forward with programs meant to hasten its socioeconomic recovery and maintain progress in poverty reduction and economic growth, it must mobilize a larger, whole-of-government and whole-of-society effort to ensure long-term economic growth, lasting peace, and sustainable development in the Bangsamoro.

#### Threats of violent extremism and land conflict remain a challenge but with stronger local government response and support

Violent extremism will continue to be a threat as long as the pernicious shadow economies remain significant in selected localities. However, it is expected that there will be local government response and support as a result of continuing institutional strengthening of the LGUs.

Land conflict is expected to continuously persist in the region in the next few years given the lack of enabling laws in terms of land governance. Thus, a stronger government support should be realized to resolve land conflicts.

#### Social protection will be efficiently and adequately delivered to internally displaced and marginalized communities

The continuing improvement of systems in the BARMM MOAs and the LGUs will result in the efficient and adequate provision of social protection to marginalized communities and internally displaced persons, particularly during emergencies. Technology will grow rapidly in the next few years, making it cheaper and more accessible to state actors and organizations for disaster response and recovery.

#### Madaris education will be strengthened and promoted in the BARMM

The importance of Madaris education in BARMM cannot be overstated. It is particularly important in the context of the Bangsamoro, which is a region that is in a country with a non-Muslim majority. Madaris education plays a vital role in preserving the Islamic faith and culture.

The passage of the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act (BAA) No. 18, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Education Code, is hoped to pave way for a Bangsamoro educational system that is relevant and responsive to the needs, ideals, and aspirations of the Bangsamoro people. More importantly, this Code is seen to strengthen the Madaris system.

As more traditional schools/Madrasahs get accredited and, in the process, getting more government support, Madaris education will be a potent pathway for accessing education in the BARMM. Therefore, there is a need for the Bangsamoro government to focus its efforts on adopting a curriculum for Madaris that is relevant and responsive to the needs and context of the Bangsamoro people.

## Technological

### Trends

#### Demand for high-quality digital connectivity

BARMM continues to face digital connectivity challenges, with inadequate information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure being one of the causes. There is a digital divide in terms of ICT access and utilization. Based on the results of the 2019 National ICT Survey, BARMM has the highest percentage of households without digital access and largest percentage of people who are not using computers among the regions in the Philippines recorded at 95.5 percent and 91.5 percent, respectively.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought this issue to the forefront by demonstrating the critical importance of digital connectivity in dealing with a crisis. The pandemic has revealed the realities that underpin our economies; limited internet connectivity means missing out on employment opportunities, education, health care, public services, as well as the power of information and digital transformation. This is particularly glaring in BARMM especially among the underprivileged and marginalized populations who lack access to computers and the internet.

### Prospects

#### Technology as a potent instrument to reduce inequity and address development challenges in BARMM

Technology is projected to be cheaper and more accessible in the next few years. It can be utilized to enhance the capability of BARMM MOAs to respond to disaster-stricken communities in an adequate and timely manner. Provision of social protection will also be rationalized through better targeting in the use of data and technology. A more important advantage of technology is the ability to leverage it to promote transparent and accountable governance.

On the economic empowerment of the poor and vulnerable sectors, technology can be used to aid farmers and fisherfolks to have better access to market information and in promoting resilient farming. With better access to technology, MSMEs can develop more competitive products and promote them more effectively. Players in the industry will also have the opportunity to access international markets and will have better access to innovations through technology.

In order to harness the potential of technology, BARMM must prioritize and increase budgetary support for digital infrastructure, including ICT, as well as research and innovation. Further, it is important to provide equal access to technology throughout BARMM, particularly to the geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas (GIDA).

#### E-Governance for efficient and effective service delivery

The Bangsamoro government focuses on e-governance in order to improve service delivery. As part of its efforts to strengthen local governance in the region, the Bangsamoro government is currently developing an innovative, citizen-centric service delivery system that fosters innovation. This entails enabling citizens to make use of the benefits of digital transformation via the application of technology for greater access to services and information. Hence, efforts have been focused on improving digital connectivity throughout the Bangsamoro region with the aim of bolstering e-governance.

## Legal

### Prospects

#### The passage of the remaining priority codes

The BTA strives to fast track the passage of priority codes that will aid in the overall development of BARMM. The delay in the passage of priority codes and other significant legislations is believed to have impeded the full realization of some development goals of the region. For instance, revenue generation in the region is a major development concern because of the delay in the passage of necessary legislation. Therefore, the BTA must enact the remaining priority codes, such as electoral, local governance, revenue, and indigenous peoples' rights before the end of the extended transition period.

#### Setting a legislative and policy agenda

For the next six years, it will be crucial for BARMM to set a legislative and policy agenda that will shape relevant and responsive policies and programmatic outcomes, both in the medium-term and in the long-term. As an important precursor to setting up this agenda, it would be necessary to ensure meaningful participation of all relevant stakeholders, particularly those from marginalized and disadvantaged communities, to achieve results that are inclusive and holistic. Additionally, the BARMM must ramp up its efforts to leverage research and evidence-based data to set the legislative and policy agenda for the BARMM.

## Environmental

### Trends

#### Climate change and increasing threat of environmental degradation

BARMM is vulnerable to natural disasters and effects of climate change. It has some of the highest risk indicators in the Philippines. BARMM's geographical location makes it vulnerable to natural disasters. Many of the areas in the region are situated in low lying areas and surrounded by water ways. The region's three mainland provinces, namely, the Maguindanao del Sur, Maguindanao del Norte, and Lanao del Sur are more susceptible to disasters like flooding and landslides.

Aside from this, illegal activities like illegal logging and deforestation have also put the region at risk, noting that the region has a total forest cover of 299,839 hectares. Many of the areas in the region have become more exposed to disaster as their protection is taken off due to illegal activities. Further, rapid commercialization and urbanization of many areas in the region has put it more at risk to disasters due to lack of proper planning and conversion of rivers, forest, and agricultural lands to commercial areas.

Climate change has exacerbated the effects of natural disaster. Among the effects of climate change is rising levels of water, rising temperature, and severe weather events. Rising level of water tide has caused frequent sea surge in the island provinces and the increase in water level causes submersion in some areas of the island provinces in the region. Also, the rising temperature has caused severe drought while severe weather events have caused frequent flooding and flood-induced landslides.

The recent onslaught of Typhoon Paeng (Nalgae) has drawn attention to the fact that typhoons and other natural disasters are becoming stronger due to climate change, resulting in more damages and casualties even in regions that are far from the eye of the typhoon, as in the case of BARMM.

### Prospects

#### Taking an all-of-government and all-of-society approach to CCA and DRRM

Taking into account the context of BARMM, which involves a confluence of man-made and natural disasters, an approach encompassing inter/intra-governmental and multi-sectoral integration shall be pursued. The Bangsamoro government shall also continue to leverage on the capacities of the CSOs to reinforce peacebuilding initiatives. Engaging and empowering CSOs is always central to the BARMM government's strategy in laying the groundwork for a peaceful transition.

Therefore, BARMM's disaster risk reduction and management and climate change adaptation (DRRM-CCA) should espouse a whole-of-government and a whole-of-society approach that underpins effective coordination and convergence of efforts among BARMM MOAs, as well as between the national government and the regional government.

#### Better monitoring, regulation, and supervision in managing environmental assets

The presence of enabling policies and the continuing improvement of systems using data, technology and innovation will equip key agencies such as the MENRE and the concerned LGUs to efficiently and effectively monitor and manage the utilization of environmental assets.

#### Strengthening BARMM's capacity to improve community resilience

The Bangsamoro government plays a critical role in the ability of the communities to recover from the ill-effects of climate change and human-induced shocks through prevention and mitigation, disaster preparedness, and improved disaster response, recovery, and rehabilitation. As the Bangsamoro government improves its systems and as communities gain better access to critical information, a manageable loss in time of emergencies is anticipated.
