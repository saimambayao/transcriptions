# Chapter 13: Plan Financing, Implementation, and Monitoring & Evaluation

The 2nd BDP 2023-2028 is the successor plan of the 1st BDP 2020-2022. It is a medium-term plan that outlines the development priorities of the Bangsamoro government for the three-year extension period and beyond. The plan aims to attain the overall goal of having an empowered, cohesive, and progressive Bangsamoro. Transforming the plan to action can only be achieved if there are strategies, programs, and projects that are well-defined that serve as direction for the plan financing, implementation, and M&E. These are key elements that contribute to the realization of the aforementioned plans and can be made available to beneficiaries.

## Plan Financing

### Approach in Program Development and Management

#### Shift from Institutional to a Sectoral Approach in Program Management

While most programs and activities are implemented by the concerned BARMM MOAs, the overall program management should be the responsibility of the entire sector. This is because programs are expected to yield outcomes, which are identified as sectoral goal and objectives in the plan. This implies that it is the accountability of the entire sector, and not just the implementing offices, in terms of its achievement or non-achievement of the sectoral goal and objectives. Since accountabilities are sectoral, its members, both the stakeholders and non-stakeholders should be meaningfully engaged in the program management. Key lessons, good practices, and success stories in program management should lead to and inform program development.

## Monitoring and Evaluation

One of the major responsibilities of the Bangsamoro government is to monitor and evaluate the implementation of 2nd BDP 2023-2028 and its accompanying BDIP. Through this, the goals and outcomes articulated in this plan will be ensured specifically those that are in the 2nd BDP's RM.

Section 4, Article XIV of RA 11054 provides for the creation of BEDC which will serve as the planning, monitoring, and coordinating agency for all development plans, programs, and projects intended for the Bangsamoro government.

### Mechanism

#### BEDC Sectoral Committees

Part of the functions of the BEDC sectoral committees under BAA 6 is to formulate and monitor the implementation of policies, programs, and projects that will promote economic growth and equitable allocation of resources for local development.

#### Regional Project Monitoring and Evaluation Committee (RPMECom)

The RPMECom, one of the special committees of BEDC, is tasked to monitor and evaluate all development programs and projects implemented by the national government, BARMM MOAs, LGUs, and government-owned and controlled corporations in the BARMM.

The RPMECom and the BEDC sectoral committees are tasked to cover the following four dimensions of M&E:

##### Implementation Monitoring

- Provides feedback on the delivery of inputs and activities in relation to the delivered outputs. This input-output monitoring keeps track of physical and financial accomplishments through feedback on resources and process requirements, delivery of specific projects and activities, and its resulting immediate outputs.
- This will be done on a monthly basis by the implementing offices and key findings and recommendations will be presented to RPMECom and will decide on the critical actions to be undertaken.

##### Outcomes Monitoring

- Keeps track of the changes in behavior or condition. These changes can either be personal, relational, cultural, or structural.
- This will be conducted by members of the RPMECom and BEDC sectoral committees on selected programs to harvest lessons, good practices, and success stories to inform future planning and programming exercises.

##### Context Monitoring

- Keeps track of the external factors that are positively or negatively affecting the implementation of PPAs. It also identifies and evaluates the risks that may adversely affect the implementation of PPAs. Most importantly, it designs mitigating measures in order to better manage the identified potential risks.

##### Program/Project Evaluation

- Assesses the appropriateness, relevance, efficiency, and effectiveness of a program or project to institutional capacity or to general welfare.

### Overall Approach

**Results-based Monitoring and Evaluation (RBME)** is the overall approach in the conduct of M&E by the RPMECom and the BEDC sectoral committees. This implies that the bias or the focus of the M&E will be on outcomes because these are the type of results that are transformational in character and the BARMM MOAs have 100 percent accountability. Specifically, these outcomes are the sectoral objectives. This does not mean, however, that outputs, thru-put, and inputs will not be periodically tracked. As mentioned earlier, physical and financial accomplishments will be tracked on a monthly basis.

### RBME Principles

The conduct of RBME activities and other RBME mechanisms will abide from the following principles:

**Principle of subsidiarity.** This means that those who are closest to the problem or directly involved in project implementation are in strategic position of identifying the specific contexts and the solutions to the challenges and gaps in respective communities. Operationally, this implies that outcome or impact evaluation of a road project should engage the communities who are directly affected by the project. On the governance side, this means that evaluating a capacity development or institutional strengthening activity should meaningfully engage the concerned office or individual in the entire process.

**Evidence-based.** This means that any claim of success or failure should be supported with data and evidence. Any recommendation or lesson should be anchored on the evidence that was provided and should be the agreed means of verification.

**Appreciative inquiry.** While it is expected that there are significant challenges in project implementation, there should be a deliberate effort to look for positive things or strengths which are attributable to the initiative. These can either be in terms of process, engagement, or result.

**Premium on understanding local contexts.** There should be investments in unpacking the specific and widely varied contexts in communities as a process in any M&E activity to be able to reduce and properly manage attribution risks.

**Inclusive and participatory.** The meaningful participation of non-state actors in M&E activities spearheaded by the LGUs brings greater legitimacy to the findings and recommendation. This is why CSO participation in RBME activities is important and necessary. Thus, it is encouraged that any RBME mechanism should include non-state actors as permanent members. Appreciation and ownership of the concerned parties on the findings and recommendations are critical. This is why highly inclusive and participatory processes should be adopted.

**Reform over tradition.** The fundamental purpose and interest in undertaking RBME activities is to introduce reforms in planning and programming, budgeting, implementation, and even policy. This is why that even those which have been practiced for several years can still be subject to amendment or even completely stopped if these do not move the reform agenda forward.

**Tight feedback loop.** It is important that once the findings are validated and the recommendations have been vetted, these should immediately inform the concerned parties so that appropriate actions will be undertaken. Any delays in reporting will have adverse repercussions on the relevance and impact of the findings and recommendations. Thus, it is important that a feedback mechanism is in-place prior to any RBME activity. A feedback mechanism can be existing mechanisms in the LGU where there is wide representation from different offices and non-state membership.

### System

To effectively perform these mandates, the Bangsamoro government adopted and localized the **Regional Project Monitoring and Evaluation System (RPMES)** which provides a scheme for M&E projects in the region, facilitates generation of information on overall status of project implementation, and detects problems that impede implementation and undertake remedial actions at the level nearest to the project sites and at the earliest time possible.

Further, BPDA, being the technical secretariat of RPMECom has adopted the RPMES database that will serve as a repository of monitored and geotagged programs and projects in the region. This database is known as **Kobo Toolbox**, a platform designed for field data collection in challenging environments. It is free and open source that works both online and offline. Most of its users are people working in humanitarian crises and aid professionals and researchers working in developing regions. It also features **Geographical Information System (GIS)**, a map of all monitored and evaluated programs and projects that is gathered through the use of geotagging.

Moreover, technical assistance to BARMM MOAs will be provided to improve project readiness and strengthen the link between planning, programming, and budgeting. Regular meetings of RPMECom, and regular reporting to BEDC will also be observed to immediately propose actions to issues and concerns raised.

Annual, midterm, and terminal evaluations will be conducted by the BEDC sectoral committees. The conduct of these evaluations will be coordinated and spearheaded by BPDA. M&E reports will be prepared and presented to the RPMECom and BEDC for information and appropriate action.
