## Sectoral Assessment

### Sectoral Trends

**BARMM has huge potential for economic activities.** It is rich in natural resources that can be used to contribute to the growth of the national economy. The natural terrain of the BARMM is diverse, with lakes, rivers, marshes, mountain ranges, valleys, substantial stretches of fertile land, and maritime resources. However, this huge potential has not been optimized due to the violent conflict that fraught the region, weak institutional support, and the informality that defined the rules governing economic activities for decades.

### Land as an Economic Asset Has Not Been Optimized

A key economic asset that has been left idle and unproductive is land. BARMM has the largest land area in the country, accounting for 11.17 percent of the total land area, and hosts 10 of the 128 Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) in the country. About 628,401 hectares are classified as alienable and disposable while 665,151 hectares are classified as forest land. In addition, a total of 340,486 hectares are covered under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP). These values are the highest in the country. It carries enormous potential as a source of income, food, employment, investment, and housing. But due to the absence of a comprehensive and inclusive land governance framework and the complexity that comes in the plurality of systems (legal, traditional, and informal systems), the potential of land as an economic asset has not been realized. Worse, it has been a significant cause of conflict, death, and displacement of civilians.

In an effort to address land conflict in the region, ministries who are directly and indirectly dealing with lands and its beneficiaries are now converging among themselves to strengthen collaboration with an end to improve delivery of public services while continuing the effort to provide free legal services, especially to agrarian reform beneficiaries and concerned landowners.

Maguindanao has the lion's share of the regional alienable and disposable (A&D) lands at 49 percent, followed by Lanao del Sur at 21 percent. In terms of forest land, Lanao del Sur registered the highest share at 38 percent, followed by Maguindanao at 30 percent. In terms of coverage under the CARP, Lanao del Sur registered the highest share at 48 percent followed by Maguindanao at 28 percent inclusive of Cotabato City and the SGA.

### Gaps Persist in Land Distribution and Tenurial Security

From the total CARP scope of 340,486.8532 hectares as of December 2021, only 68 percent or 229,972.9852 hectares had been distributed under the CARP. This means that 110,513.8680 hectares are yet to be distributed. Lanao del Sur registered the highest distribution rate at 82 percent, followed by Basilan at 68 percent while Maguindanao posted the lowest rate of distribution at 48 percent.

In terms of the provision of support services, a total of 104 Agrarian Reform Communities (ARCs) have been established, launched, and are able to organize a total of 240 Agrarian Reform Beneficiary Organizations (ARBOs). The formation of ARCs and ARBOs is one of the strategies of the program to help maximize the chances of Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries (ARBs) to avail interventions both local and foreign assisted. It is a fact that most of the interventions especially from foreign donors are course through cooperatives or organized groups, thus the formation of ARCs and ARBOs. A total of 34,743 ARBs have been assisted as of October 2019. Support includes: training (soft component) and the delivery of farm input support, common service facilities, and infrastructures (hard component).

**Agriculture and fishery are BARMM's main sources of food, employment, and income.** It used to be the largest contributor to the region's overall economy 21 years ago, accounting for more than half of the region's economy. With the growth of the services sector, it is now the second-highest contributor to the region's economy, accounting for 36.41 percent in 2021. This structural transformation, however, does not mean that the sector is weakening or becoming less relevant. In fact, it is one of the biggest contributors that caused the region to be resilient at the time of the pandemic, registering the lowest decline among the regions in the Philippines in 2020.

### Seaweeds as BARMM's Top Commodity

BARMM is the country's largest seaweed producer, accounting for 48.42 percent of the country's seaweed production. Tawi-Tawi is the main source of seaweed production in BARMM, registering more than 90 percent of regional production. The municipalities in Sitangkai and Sibutu islands are the largest seaweed culture areas in Tawi-Tawi province. The comparative advantage and market potential for carrageenan as an export product of seaweeds remains high in the region.

To sustain the seaweed production, BARMM must invest in the post-harvest processing plant and modernized facilities/equipment or the overall value-chain development of the seaweeds industry, establish municipal-wide seaweed nursery, and strengthen seaweed research and development in order to have full control from production to marketing.

### High-Value Crops on the Rise in BARMM

Valued by small-scale farmers for its tolerance and growth, cassava is the second top commodity of BARMM based on percent share, accounting for 41.7 percent of the country's total cassava production. As a complement or alternative to rice and corn as a staple food, cassava was ranked significantly high in terms of volume of production and area harvested. Its yield in 2020 was close to the national average. Lanao del Sur was the largest contributor to regional cassava production in 2020, accounting for 47 percent.

BARMM is the country's second-largest producer of mangosteen, accounting for 22.4 percent of the country's production. It is the country's third largest producer of rubber, coffee, lanzones, and corn, contributing 18.4 percent, 17.4 percent, 15.3 percent, and 14 percent, respectively. In addition, the region is the second-largest producer of durian and the 5th largest producer of abaca.

### Bangsamoro Strategic Agricultural and Fisheries Development Areas (BSAFDA)

The BSAFDA was identified as the essential supporting strategy in the attainment of various development goals and priority agenda in the region, namely: zero hunger; sustainable agri-fishery production; consumption; and food security.

All identified agri-fishery and agro-industrial areas clustered under BSAFDA in the Bangsamoro region shall form part of the Network of Protected Areas for Fishery, Agricultural and Agro-Fishery Industrial Development (NPAFAAD) to avoid illegal land use conversions and to protect the welfare of the farmers and as well as the Bangsamoro people through food security and sustainable agri-fishery production and agro-industrial establishment in achieving the Bangsamoro that is socioeconomically stable, resilient and globally competitive farmers and fisherfolks.

Currently, the identified BSAFDAs cover about 628,872.64 hectares for agricultural production and 125,562.44 for inland fishing as shown in Table 7.5 below. Maguindanao del Sur has the largest agriculture and inland fishery areas included in the protected networks.

The region has 113 municipalities, 52 of these are coastal municipalities and 45 are inland municipalities. The second largest lake in the country is found in Lanao del Sur with an approximate area of 34,700 hectares. Lake Lanao is the deepest in the country and is considered one of the major tropical lakes in Southeast Asia. It is the source of hydroelectric power for the whole island of Mindanao aside from providing irrigation water and various fish products. Other lakes like Dapao in Lanao del Sur, Buluan and Balut in Maguindanao, Seit and Panamao in Sulu, Danao and Singuang in Mapun, Tawi-Tawi, and similar bodies of water are also potential resources of commercial scale fish products. The region has the largest share of swamp area with around 105,000 hectares and is being programmed for extensive agricultural and fishery development.

The region has the highest registered fisherfolk population in the country. As of December 2018, a total of 252,758 fisherfolks were registered in the Fisherfolks Registration (FishR) system. Of these, 162,167 are male and 90,951 are female; 102,996 are engaged in capture fishing; 45,275 are in aquaculture; 17,168 in fish vending; 23,251 in gleaning; 9,363 in fish processing; and 16,765 are engaged in other types of fishing activities.

For the period of 2014 up to 2018, fisheries production increased every year except in 2016 and 2017 due to typhoons and dry spells that affected the production of commercial and municipal fish products. Aquaculture has, however, continuously increased.

Moreover, in terms of fisheries value of production, the region has Php24,931,125.26 in 2021. The contribution came from the municipal, aquaculture, marine municipal, commercial, and inland municipal fisheries. As for the seaweeds, the Bangsamoro region remained the highest producer in the whole country with a total of 720,300.94 metric tons.

Tawi-Tawi and Sulu Provinces must develop their potential in establishing a commercial scale nursery, hatchery, and grow-out for grouper, abalone, sea cucumber, and other high-value commercial fish in order to boost their economy and possibly exporting of their product. A small-scale canning industry is very potential due to the abundant source of freshwater, but one of its challenges is the insufficient power supply in the island provinces.

### Livestock and Poultry Production as an Important Economic Activity

An important segment of the agriculture industry is the production of livestock and poultry. Animals are raised by households for either consumption or market sale. BARMM's potential in Halal meat production and manufacturing can be explored now that there is a rising demand for halal products. In terms of livestock production by animal type in the region, in 2021, carabao tops the production, followed by cattle, and goats.

### Food Security Remains to be a Challenge in BARMM

This relative advantage in agriculture, forestry, and fishery did not translate to sustained food security. BARMM is a significant contributor to rice in Mindanao. The region contributes 16.5 percent to Mindanao palay production. Heavy investments in rice and corn yielded growth in production, but productivity remains low. The yield per hectare in 2020 was only 3.11 mt. compared to the country's average of 4.09 mt. (PSA 2022). In fact, this gap widened considering the average yield in the past years from 2011 to 2020. BARMM's productivity during this period was only 2.77 tons per hectare, significantly lower compared to the national average yield of 3.93 tons per hectare in the same period. As compared with other Mindanao regions, BARMM registered the lowest yield except for 2019.

| Region | Percent Share |
|--------|---------------|
| Region XII | 29% |

The lack of required infrastructure and access to technology resulted in pre- and post-harvest losses and inefficiency, leading to low profitability among farmers and fisherfolks. In fact, farmers and fisherfolks are among the poorest sectors of the population. Subsistence incidence, a measure on the proportion of families with difficulty in accessing basic food requirements, was highest in 2018 at 23.3 percent. In 2021, the region was ranked second at 8.8 percent.

**Figure 7.16 Subsistence Incidence, BARMM vs. Philippines, 2015-2021**

All provinces registered a decline in subsistence incidence in 2021. Among the BARMM provinces, Sulu registered the highest at 17.1 percent followed by Basilan at 16.3 percent in the same period. On the other hand, Cotabato City registered an increase from 2018 to 2021.

### Barter Trade as an Income Support Mechanism

Barter trading has been the dominant type of trading in the BARMM for years. In the Sulu archipelago, barter is characterized by inter-familial transactions between Sama Badjaos from Tawi-Tawi and Sabah, Malaysia where consensual arrangements are bestowed tolerance by local authorities in Sabah. In Tawi-Tawi, the resources for each trading run of a wooden-hull vessel pool the resources of the vessel owner and his crew and financial capital from teachers, entrepreneurs, policemen and other individuals (Quitoriano, 2022). In Panglima Sugala (Tawi-Tawi), market days are characterized by food exchanges between farmers and fisherfolks based on relationship and social trust, not price mechanisms. When the value of a farmer's product is lower than the fisherfolks, the latter is given the privilege to access the farm to compensate for the gap in value. So, while barter trade is essential in the informal economy, it served as a potent safety net and social protection facility that are absent in the formal economy, particularly in times of crisis or periods of scarcity. One example was the continuing trade between the Sulu Archipelago and Sabah despite the restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (Franco, 2021).

### Most MSMEs in BARMM are in the Informal Sector

Due to the fragility of the region, a large part of the business sector, particularly the MSMEs, are in the informal sector. This implies that many operate beyond the rules, regulations, and support of the state, leading to low quality of products and services, low productivity, and limited legal and social protections for workers. More critically, the MSMEs' potential to contribute to broad-based growth and state building has not been optimized.

A starting point in formalizing the MSMEs is business name registration (BNR) which is a frontline service of the MTIT. The Philippines' BNR system is the portal for the registration of MSMEs under single-proprietorship ownership. This registration will provide legal identity and will gain the rights to use the chosen business name. Once registered, MSMEs engaged in trading, retailing, manufacturing, and services can receive various capacity development support such as enterprise skills training, digital literacy, product pricing and packaging.

### More Than a Hundred-Fold Increase in Business Name Registration in BARMM in 2021

In 2021, a total of 8,427 MSMEs have registered, a 161.46 percent increase from the number in 2020. It is the highest in a span of five years. Such an increase was a manifestation of the resilience of the Bangsamoro entrepreneurs given the lingering effects of the pandemic.

**Figure 7.18 BARMM BNR, 2017-2021**

| Year | Number of BNR |
|------|---------------|
| 2017 | 2,575 |
| 2018 | 2,881 |
| 2019 | 3,223 |
| 2020 | 3,572 |
| 2021 | 8,427 |

*Source: MTIT*

For two years (2020-2021), BARMM has registered 11,650 businesses through its five provincial offices including Cotabato City and created 31,000 jobs and generated an investment of around 2.5 billion pesos.

### BARMM Accounts Less Than One Percent of the Total BNR in the Country

Despite a significant increase in the BNR in 2021, BARMM still registered the lowest BNRs in the country, accounting for only 0.92 percent.

### Table 7.9 BNRs, Percent Share, National vs. BARMM, 2017-2021

| | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2021 |
|---------|------|------|------|------|
| National | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| BARMM | 0.34 | 0.24 | 0.33 | 0.92 |

*Source: MTIT*

Table 7.9 implies that intensified efforts are needed in the campaign on the formalization of the businesses in the BARMM. However, the work remains herculean as tens of thousands are estimated to remain in the informal sector.

### Maguindanao Outpaced Lanao del Sur BNRs in 2021

From 2017 to 2020, Lanao del Sur used to be the leading province in terms of BNR. In 2021, Maguindanao outpaced Lanao del Sur, accounting for more than half of the total BNR in the region in 2021. A 308.76 percent increase in BNRs was recorded in the province, from only 1,096 in 2020 to 4,480 in 2021.

**Figure 7.19 BNR, BARMM province, 2017-2021**

### MSMEs are Key Engines of Inclusive and Broad-Based Growth

From 2017 to 2021, the total amount of investments generated by MSMEs reached Php 9.02 billion, generating a total of 62,166 jobs within the said period.

But for MSMEs to be competitive and have sustained financial growth, they should have access to technical support, technology, capital or credit, and market access, among others. Access to these various types of government support can only be made possible if they become part of the formal sector.

### Remarkable Growth of Investments as a Sign of Stronger Investors' Confidence

BARMM generated Php25.3 billion worth of investments, 20,103 employment, and 46 Registered Business Enterprises (RBEs) from 2010 to 2021. The province of Maguindanao recorded the highest investments and employment generation with a total of Php16.6 billion and 12,923, respectively, over the 12-year period. On the other hand, the province of Sulu shows the lowest investments and employment generation with a total of Php850.9 million and 170, respectively.

### Table 7.10 Number of Registered Business Enterprises, 2010-2021

### Untapped Tourism Potential

Due to the long history of violent conflict, BARMM has not been a tourist destination for decades. Investors have been wary of the security issues and the negative perception that the region carries. As a result, BARMM tourism contribution to GDP accounts for only 0.8 percent (PSA, 2018). However, there is a significant wealth of tourism potential, including tourism job creation, which has been untapped for years.

With the significant gains in the peace process as a result of the political settlement, and as the economy opens up for new investments, there is growing interest in the development of tourism potentials in the region. With the opening of flights from Cotabato to Zamboanga and Tawi-Tawi, many felt that this will gradually alter the perception of BARMM from a conflict-ridden region to a tourist destination.

The pandemic brought a new set of challenges to the region in terms of tourism. The thriving of the tourism industry in the region amidst the pandemic was due to local tourism. This exemplified the resilience of the Bangsamoro as the region registered the lowest decline in 2021. Tourism is a sub-sector that carries enormous potential in contributing to the overall economic resiliency of the region.

### A Thousand-Fold Increase in Tourist Arrivals in BARMM in 2021

The pandemic put the tourism sub-sector on a standstill in 2020, causing tourist arrivals to drop to as low as 7,332. But renewed confidence and interest were recorded in 2021 when tourist arrivals grew by more than a thousand-fold at 195,822. However, despite the monumental increase in 2021, the number is still far below as compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2018 and 2019.

**Figure 7.20 BARMM Tourist Arrivals, 2018-2021**

| Year | Tourist Arrivals |
|------|------------------|
| 2018 | 444,171 |
| 2019 | 357,203 |
| 2020 | 7,332 |
| 2021 | 195,822 |

*Source: MTIT*

### BARMM Accounts Less Than One Percent of the Total Tourist Arrivals in the Country

Despite the strong rebound in 2021, tourist arrivals in BARMM remained to be less than 1 percent of the tourist arrivals in the country. BARMM's contribution to the total tourist arrival used to be 4.98 percent in 2018.

### Table 7.11 Percent Share to National, Tourist Arrivals, 2018-2021

### Lanao del Sur is the Leading Tourist Destination in BARMM in a 4-Year Period

Lanao del Sur accounted for 35 percent of the tourist arrivals in BARMM, making it the top tourist destination. It has to be noted that Tawi-Tawi was the leading tourist destination in 2019, accounting for 33.75 percent. With the opening of new flights from Cotabato to Tawi-Tawi in 2022, it is expected that Tawi-Tawi will be able to outpace Lanao del Sur as the leading tourist destination in the region in the next few years.

**Figure 7.21 Percent Share to Region, Tourist Arrivals, by Province, 2018-2021**

### Policy Supports Urgently Needed for Ecozone and Freeport Development

BARMM is encouraged to promote and accelerate sound and balanced industrial, economic, and social development through the establishment of special economic zones and free ports in suitable and strategic locations in the Bangsamoro area. However, the identified potential economic zone areas are untapped because there is inadequate community infrastructure that will support economic gains and accessibility to resources and a limited supply of water and electricity for use of the ecozone.

Further, the granting of fiscal incentives which must be anchored in the legislation of the Bangsamoro Economic Zone Authority (BEZA) Law is not yet established. The Manual of Operations which contains the set of guidelines and registration of ecozone developers, locator companies, and other ancillary providers is yet to be amended to integrate with the transition of the region from ARMM to BARMM, and with the intent to simplify the registration process.

By virtue of MMA Act 154 and pursuant to Proclamation No. 01 dated March 15, 2010, the first Freeport and Ecozone were created and established in the ARMM.

Upon the ratification of the BOL, BEZA was created through the authority provided under BAA 13. With the conversion of Polloc Port to Polloc Freeport and Ecozone, it was expected to be the regional economic hub. However, there is a limited expansion of opportunities in industry and services observed in the past couple of years. With lesser capitalization and pouring on investment to venture into the port, the maritime industry became a slow-moving contributor to the economic growth of the region.

### Low Compliance Among Registered Cooperatives in BARMM

There is a total of 12,214 registered cooperatives in BARMM from 2010 to 2020. Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur are the provinces with the highest number of registered cooperatives, accounting to 38.24 percent or 4,671 and 37.29 percent or 4,554, respectively. Producer cooperatives registered the largest share at 37.58 percent or 4,590 registers, followed by Marketing at 27.54 percent or 3,364 and Agricultural at 12.82 percent or 1,566. As of 2020, only 11.66 percent or 1,424 are compliant.

The Bangsamoro Cooperative and Social Enterprise (BCSE) Bill is yet to be approved and passed by the Bangsamoro Parliament. The said bill is essential for the operationalization of the BCSE as this will serve as a legal basis for their existence and strategic planning and programming.

Parallel with the regional government, the Cooperative and Social Enterprise Authority (CSEA) is in its transition phase from being the sole agency mandated to register cooperatives in the defunct ARMM - Cooperative Development Authority (CDA). The policies and guidelines for cooperatives were predominantly aligned with the previous entity, making the newly registered cooperatives, which were mainly composed of former combatants, encounter difficulties in complying the requirements.

Several efforts are being made to institutionalize Social Enterprise (SE) in the region. This was being made due to the lack of national government legislation relating to SE - unlike cooperatives, which existed by virtue of RA 9520. As of now, the Cooperatives and SE sub-sector are in continuing talks with the principal author of the Social Enterprise Bill as one of the steps to the enactment of the said bill.

### Labor Force Participation Rate (LFPR) Was Below the National Average in 2018 and 2019 but Performed Better in 2020

The LFPR in BARMM used to be the lowest in the country. But this exhibited an upward trend in 2019, leading to a higher LFPR than the national average in 2020. However, this remained to be the lowest among the Mindanao regions.

**Figure 7.22 Labor Force Participation Rate, Philippines vs. BARMM, 2018-2020**

### Unemployment and Underemployment Rates Were Below the National Average and on a Downward Trend

For the past three years, BARMM's unemployment and underemployment rates have been consistently lower than the national average. Further, the said indicators have been on a declining trend. The growth of the industry and services sectors has made the region more resilient to internal and external shocks. Growth in construction, mining, real estate, retail trade, and food and accommodation services provided job opportunities with a reliable and steady stream of income.

However, youth unemployment, self-employment, and low average earnings and wages in the region have to be investigated because these are reflections of limited opportunities in the labor market.

### Labor Productivity is Far from the Philippine Average in All Economic Sectors

Among the major industry groups, AFF consistently registered the lowest labor productivity at the national level and in BARMM. On the other hand, the industry registered the highest labor productivity. This is why the structural transformation of BARMM has been critical in increasing overall labor productivity.

BARMM registered lower labor productivity in all major industry groups as compared with the national average. Table 7.12 shows the trend of labor productivity by major industry groups from 2012 to 2017 of BARMM and the national average.

## Development Opportunities

**BARMM's rich natural resources.** BARMM is a unique region, having rich natural and cultural resources, natural tourist spots, and diverse wildlife that need to be explored and developed. It has vast tracks of idle lands which could be utilized for agriculture, particularly food security, agro-forestry, manufacturing, and services-related investments such as tourism, retail trade, housing, and among others.

The region is dubbed as the "unpolished gem" of Mindanao with its natural wealth, human resource, and presence of ethnocultural beliefs and traditions. The concept of diversification and value-adding is the key schemes to unlock these potentials.

The region also has a dynamic and relatively young population, with 42 percent belonging to the 15-39-year-old age bracket. Hence, the region has a large pool of highly trainable workforce.

BARMM has the unique opportunity to be a place for nature-based and cultural tourism. Nature-oriented tourism is one of the fastest-growing areas in the tourism industry. The region is a favored nature-based tourism destination as long as relative peace and security are sustained. Given its various natural assets, the region can provide several different nature-based tourism experiences including hiking and trekking/bushwalking, wildlife viewing/birdwatching, swimming and beach experiences, fishing and sailing, scuba diving, camping, biking, water rafting, kayaking, river and inter-island canoeing, and a host of other outdoor activities.

Nature-based tourism activities are wide-ranging and can cater to all agencies. It can range from passive activities such as sightseeing, scenic driving, relaxing by the beach, and dining among the mangroves to hard and soft adventure activities. The key is to provide nature-based tourism activities and destinations that enhance the broader tourism experiences of the visitors. The overall visitor experience in nature-based tourism is inextricably linked with all other aspects of the visitor's total experience - such as transport convenience, food, culture, accommodation, sanitation, and the perceptual quality and feel of the general environment. All of these elements complement each other and together compose an individual's tourism experience. Another unique selling proposition that Bangsamoro could tap into is its Islamic character, through the promotion of Halal tourism and Islamic culture.

**Strategic air and seaports with proximity to the Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA).** The region also has strategic air and seaports with proximity to the BIMP-EAGA, a window and access for more investment opportunities.

The Greater Sulu-Sulawesi Corridor is a maritime corridor that covers North Sulawesi in Indonesia, Sabah in Malaysia, and Mindanao and Palawan in the Philippines. The corridor is mainly determined by the geography of the Sulu-Sulawesi Seas, a highly biodiverse, globally significant biogeographic unit in the heart of the Coral Triangle—the center of the world's highest concentration of marine biodiversity.

Moreover, there are strong historical trade links in the corridor, with trade concentrated between North Sulawesi and Mindanao, and between Sabah and Mindanao. The corridor is also the nerve center of barter trade in BIMP-EAGA, particularly in agriculture and aquaculture products. Transport connectivity consists of port-to-port trade flows and shipping services within the Sulu-Sulawesi seas.

Also, there was the enactment of R.A. 7718, or the Build-Operate and Transfer (BOT) law providing more focus on the Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) which gives more opportunity to both local and foreign investments in the country.

**Global and regional opportunities for tourism, halal, and Islamic finance.** In terms of competitiveness and sustainability, the implementation must include the complete package of assistance - MSME Development Cycle. These include most importantly the provision of high-quality, sophisticated, and standard-compliant production and processing facilities. These interventions are areas of opportunity to partner, converge, and collaborate with partner stakeholders and enablers. There are existing business models and technology that can be adopted for the benefit of MSMEs.

The Strategic Investment Priorities Plan recently approved by the national government identified three registrable investment activities that are unique to BARMM. These are the halal industry, Islamic banking, and BIMP-EAGA-related investment enterprises.

Further, it is privileged to be the only region in the country with its own Bangsamoro Board of Investments (BBOI) that can dispense fiscal and non-fiscal incentives to investors, provided that the amount of investment is below one billion pesos.

There are existing systems on halal, Islamic financing, and e-commerce that the BARMM can explore.

The Bangsamoro Halal Board (BHB), is the policy-making body of the Bangsamoro Government on Halal Industry development and set the overall direction in formulating, advocating, coordinating, overseeing and assessing the implementation of the Bangsamoro Halal Industry Development and Promotion Program such as the following: 1) Adoption of the M.C. 1 series of 2021 otherwise known as the Halal Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR); 2) Operationalization of the Bangsamoro Standards and Halal Testing Laboratory (BHSTL) of the MOST that provides quality, reliable, and impartial analytical testing and calibration services that meet the needs of the customers and the requirements of ISO/IEC 17025:2017; and, 3) Implementation of various Halal PPAs of the MAFAR, MTIT, and MOST i.e. Halal production and establishment of slaughter houses, assistance to MSMEs on the conduct of training/orientation on Halal awareness, food safety, product packaging and labelling, promotion on the Halal Poultry and provision of subsidy for Halal certification and License-To-Operate (LTO), among others.

**Relative peace and stability in formerly conflict-affected communities.** Camps and other communities which suffered from a long history of violent conflict are now accessible.

**Fresh infrastructure investments.** The region has the presence of basic utilities and infrastructure support such as water, telecommunications, power, seaports, airports, roads, and bridges connecting people to markets, safeguards smooth transport of goods and services to ensure everyone including existing and potential investors have a comfortable working and livable place.

**Strong partnership between national government, private sector, and development partners.** There is a solid partnership with the ministries and development partners. The BPDA and MAFAR in collaboration with the World Food Programme (WFP) initiated the creation of the Bangsamoro Food Sufficiency Task Force (BFSTF) to ensure that policies, programs, projects, and activities on achieving food security shall be coordinated, responsive, and effective.

The presence of international development funding institutions as partners towards the economic agenda of the BARMM is just one of the areas of access to finance or financing. Again, appropriate proposed programs will lead to more economic activities' implementation.

Convergence programming is one strategy to explore to maximize the resources of other concerned and partner BARMM MOAs and enable the rights of the small enterprises and local industries equal access to livelihood opportunities.

Partnering with private or business sectors, as major industry players and actors, is an open area of opportunity to lobby policy measures in the creation of a business-friendly enabling environment.

**Public-Private Partnership (PPP).** LGUs are corporate entities. They are by law encouraged and have the authority to enter into PPP for the implementation of revenue-generating projects. The LGUs can leverage their assets such as land, funds from the national government, or own-sourced funds against the investments of the private sector who has the competency to design, construct and develop, operate, and ensure the financial viability/profitability of a tourism site. There are several PPP modalities that LGUs can use, depending on the nature of the project to be implemented. PPPs provide LGUs the opportunity to also earn revenues based on their asset input to the partnership enterprise.

**Inter-LGU Partnership.** If funds are insufficient, LGUs can partner and contribute their respective assets and funds in order to develop and operate a financially viable tourism site. LGUs, together, can also enter into a PPP. Under an inter-LGU partnership, the contribution made to the partnership by each LGU can be valued as the basis for the value of its capital and therefore share in the revenues. A separate management entity can be organized, or this can be outsourced to a contracted private sector.

**National-Local Partnership.** The province and/or municipalities can partner with national government agencies in order to develop and operate a tourism site. For example, a partnership with the DENR for the grant of usufruct rights or special purpose use of protected areas for tourism activities can be made wherein both parties generate revenues out of the proceeds.

**Grant Funds.** There are national government agencies, such as the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority (TIEZA) that provides financing for the preparation of master plans and feasibility studies for the development of tourism areas, as well as funds for the construction of facilities. The provincial government can avail of these grant funds to finance the detailed design planning and development of the tourism clusters proposed in the tourism development plan. Some development partners also provide technical assistance grants to conduct studies and prepare plans for certain tourism-related activities such as heritage conservation. This is particularly useful in the detailed planning and preparation of urban design guidelines for the cultural heritage districts of Bangsamoro.

**Expanding Governance to Include Enterprise Development.** The Bangsamoro provincial and municipal governments will benefit from a well-organized, competent enterprise development department that will initially concentrate on the creation of tourism-related public enterprises, the development of PPP and intergovernmental partnership tourism projects, and the mobilization/generation of resources for investments in tourism ventures that bring in revenue.

**Presence of a wide range of business opportunities.** Also, there was the enactment of RA 7718, or the Build-Operate and Transfer (BOT) law that provides more focus on the PPP which gives more opportunity to both local and foreign investments. In addition, the BARMM, being an autonomous government, could also create bills relevant to the boosting and surge of investments in the region.

## Priority Challenges to be Addressed in 2023-2028

### Agriculture, Fisheries, Agrarian Reform

One of the key challenges to be addressed in 2023-2028 is **low agriculture and fisheries productivity**. This is associated with:

**High production cost.** High production cost is due to several factors. These include the high cost of farm inputs (fertilizers, seeds, and labor); limited access to credit; and limited mechanization, among others. Other critically important factors include the limited technical and managerial capacity of farmers; inadequate agriculture infrastructure support, particularly irrigation facilities for rice; soil fertility and water management; and inadequately funded extension services and programs of government.

**High cost of post-production and marketing and high retail price.** High transportation and high fuel costs are among the biggest post-production costs. However, it is not only fuel cost that contributes to high transportation cost; the poor infrastructure facilities that include road network from FMRs; lack of consolidation and processing centers leading to high consolidation and logistics costs; and lack of milling facilities and power interruption leading to high milling cost.

High retail price is a direct threat to food security because while farmers retain a portion of their harvest for their own consumption, many of the poor will have to buy rice at high retail price. Though BARMM is considered self-sufficient in terms of rice production, some of the rice produced in the region are not consumed in the region.

- **Weak extension services.** This challenge is brought on by the inadequate manufacturing/reproduction of appropriate IEC materials for distribution and the sparse deployment of Agricultural Extension Workers (AEW) at the provincial/municipal level.

- **Low technology generated for commercialization.** Insufficient capacity building for R&D workers and a dearth of approved plantilla positions for research results in a lack of specialization and lack of a research strategy, both of which will weaken collaborations with academic institutions. This problem is also accounted for by a lack of research-related facilities and insufficient funding for R&D.

- **Weak agricultural regulation.** This is related to weak implementation of regulatory issuances, lack of pest and disease diagnostic, forecasting, and early warning, weak strategy for revenue generation, and limited monitoring and support to agricultural products.

- **Lack of highly reliable, prompt, and accurate agri-fishery laboratory test results, confirmatory diagnosis, and production and animal health recommendations.** This is related to the lack of logistics for laboratory activities and extension services, weak linkage with other regional and national laboratories, insufficient conduct of laboratory analyses, lack of laboratory facilities, machines, and equipment, and lack of agri-fishery laboratory database.

- **Coastal ecosystem degradation.** The coastal ecosystem is crucial for fisheries. This includes coral reefs, beds of submerged aquatic vegetation, and mangrove forests. Factors influencing its degradation are inappropriate utilization of inorganic fertilizer in seaweed farming, lack of a mechanism to sustain marine protected areas, weak participation of communities in coastal resource management, illegal cuttings, and conversion of mangrove areas into the fishpond, poor information dissemination, weak regulatory data and system support, and the lack of water delineation law.

- **Limited aquaculture and capture fisheries development intervention.** Currently, there is no established Mariculture Park that supports services for processing, transport, and marketing and an anchoring system for floating fish cages, fish landings, cold storage, etc. There is also a lack of supply of hatchery-bred fingerlings and formulated feed. Capacity building for fisherfolks is limited, and infrastructures, hatcheries and breeding stations are insufficient.

- **Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.** This is attributed to weak enforcement of fishery laws, weak coordination with LGUs and law enforcement agencies, limited staff capacity building, insufficient Monitoring Control and Surveillance Floating Assets, and lack of an Integrated Marine Environment Monitoring System (IMEMS).

- **Low competitiveness in farming and fishing.** "The average age of the Filipino farmer is 57. Assuming an average life span of 70, we might reach a critical [shortage] of farmers in just 15 years." Due to a lack of access to land and funding as well as the fact that farming and fishing require a lot of labor and pay little, the younger generation lacks enthusiasm in engaging in these activities. Young farmers and fishermen have little access to support, opportunities, and creative programs, and there is a lack of information on the advantages of farming and fishing. The insufficient absorption capacity of farmers and fishermen, as well as limited access to loans and agri-fishery insurance, are further contributing elements to this dilemma.

- **Weak monitoring & evaluation.** This is due to the lack of a database system for a list of beneficiaries, a lack of modern technology in reporting and M&E, a shortage of technical staff with the necessary skills, and a lack of M&E tools.

The second key challenge to be addressed within 2023-2028 is the **intergenerational tenancy among farmers and inequitable land distribution**. This is associated with:

- **Stringent and lengthy procedures of land ownership.** Sensitivity of the beneficiary identification process, strict requirements for processing and acquiring lands, time-consuming technical procedures for cancellation and transfer actions, loss of control over the awarded lands due to leases and sales to financial actors, intermediaries, and landlords, the presence of inaccurate information and inadequate cooperation from concerned landowners, and poor implementation of a properly documented tenancy agreement/leasehold program are the factors that contribute to this issue.

- **Conflicts over land tenure and ownership**, which are common in BARMM, are another important element and the primary reason that rido or clan feuds break out.

The third core problem to be addressed under this sub-sector is the **High food insecurity of households at 44.5 percent in 2019**. This is caused by:

- **High post-harvest losses.** Poor FMR identification and implementation, insufficient financial support for post- and pre-harvest infrastructure, and a lack of information or an inventory of pre- and post-harvest facilities are some of the factors contributing to this problem. Due to this, farmers and organizations perform poorly, and old-fashioned post-harvest methods are still employed. Convergence among agencies is needed to have a responsive program.

- **High vulnerability to disaster.** This includes damages due to emerging pests and diseases which results in significant output losses.

- **Weak partnerships with private sectors and industry players.** Value chain analysis is crucial for identifying elements that either increase or decrease a market's efficiency. Lack of a food security council or outdated established councils as a result of the merger of agencies into one ministry, such as the Agrarian Reform Council and Agri fishery Council, the existence of a weak or limited aggregation system for smallholders, an outdated industrial plan, a lack of legislation governing the establishment of government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs) in BARMM and the absence of any GOCC, as well as the lack of an entrepreneurial mindset and functional ability among farmers and fishers contributes to this challenge.

- **Limited opportunity for market linkages activities.** This includes unorganized value chain linkages, insufficient funding for food product development and processing, and inadequate marketing expertise among farmers and fishermen. Limited support for Halal and organic production program, lack of transportation tools, a lack of mechanisms for inclusive funding for farmers and fishermen, and restricted access to domestic and international markets are all included.

### Trade and Industry

A core problem that needs to be addressed in 2023-2028 under trade and industry is the **low competitiveness and sustainability of MSMEs and industries**. This is mainly caused by the following:

- **Mismatch in skills and available resources.** The mismatch between the skill sets that the region's sectors require, and the skill training offered to the potential pool of workers represents a broader gap in vocational skill training. The majority of these resources are therefore not being fully utilized.

- **Technical competency of small entrepreneurs and industry players to maximize their resources is outdated to a no-zero-competency level.** The factors contributing to this challenge are the literacy and awareness of the community in the existing and available government programs. To cite an example, the information on the zero-waste management program in the coconut industry is not completely cascaded to the farmers to enable them to enjoy the maximum productivity potentials of the by-products of coconut. Further, certifications, licenses, registrations, permits, and other business operation processes are costly.

- **Limited access to production and processing facilities.** Compliance with product standards requires a large amount of capitalization more so that it needs facilities and equipment for the production and processing of value-added commodities. Hence, the absence of these facilities resulted in a limited number of competitive and standard-compliant products and services. Taking into account the economic status of the regions' MSMEs, these necessities remain a challenge.

- **Limited access to credit facilities by the MSMEs, farmers, and fisherfolks.** Only highly capitalized organizations and firms with long credit histories have access to formal financing institutions. Most MSMEs, farmers, and fisherfolks resort to an informal credit system that bears the high cost of borrowing.

- **Limited connectivity.** Connectivity in terms of mobile networks and telecommunication is a major challenge in Bangsamoro. Perhaps, the same could be said in other regions of the country; however, it is much more apparent in peripheral areas of Bangsamoro. In urban centers such as Cotabato City and other communities in the provinces, internet connectivity is heavily dependent on the signal of mobile networks. In many instances, particularly in BaSulTa areas, mobile signal is not even felt. This poor connectivity tremendously impacts the development of the local economy, thus, impeding the implementation of digital marketing and cashless transactions throughout the region.

### Investments

A core problem that needs to be addressed under this sub-sector within 2023-2028 is the **limited private investments in BARMM**. This is mainly due to the following:

- **Low business confidence.** There is a low or negative impression among investors in relation to BARMM as an investment destination. This is mainly brought by peace and order issues, limited infrastructure, poor connectivity, as well as inadequate logistic facilities, and an unstable political and policy landscape.

- **Underdeveloped Halal products and services.** The government has been pushing time and again for the promotion of halal products and services. However, the government failed to focus on the development and sustenance of the production of halal products for domestic and export markets. Halal industry development must be one of the identified priority areas under economic development.

- **High cost of utilities.** The high cost of utilities and other logistics needed for the operation of the business contributes to an "unfriendly" business environment, thus, a major challenge to start-up enterprises.

- **Weak linkages of the BARMM with the BIMP-EAGA economic integration (e.g., Halal industry and revival of barter trading).** The issue of weak linkages of the region with the BIMP EAGA market can be attributed to Limited number of infra-connectivity projects. Connecting the region to the international market through the expansion of roads and communication infrastructures will address the gap on connectivity; Limited number of standard-compliant production and processing facilities, Limited trading engagement on the international and inter-regional markets, Limited number of Halal-certified products and services; and Lack of Techno-Business Incubator.

- **Lack of industry roadmap.** The BARMM has yet to formulate its investment roadmap. On the part of the MTIT, the BOI will lead in the formulation of an investment roadmap and framework that will detail the current investment situation and outline the various interventions needed to promote the region as an investment destination of choice by investors.

  The Bangsamoro Investment Roadmap Framework will serve as a structured management tool for planning, forecasting, and promotion of investments and as a basis for effecting policies and implementing programs that will support the development and growth of investments including funding for strategic promotion activities, industry development, policy research, value proposition, and facilitation services.

- **Poor implementation of the ease of doing a business act.** Another reason for the low level of investments in the region is the poor implementation of the Ease of Doing Business and Effective Government Service Delivery Act of 2018 or RA 11032 in the BARMM, particularly in digitalizing government transactions.

- **Inadequate data/information on investment opportunities.** The inadequacy of data/information complementing the investment opportunities in the region such as Investment Development Plans, CLUP, LGU development plan, the potential areas for investment (land area), ease of doing business, clean land title, areas abundant of raw materials and the like contributed to the lack of information of investors on what the BARMM can offer. Investors just became satisfied with their establishment in other places because there is no sufficient data/information showcasing the region as an investment-friendly destination.

### Tourism

The fourth core problem under this sub-sector is the **underdeveloped tourism circuits in the region**.

- **Underdeveloped tourism circuits.** There are no established tourism circuits in the region. Tourism products in Bangsamoro are limited to nature tourism and beaches. While there exist many tourist destinations, a vast majority of them are still potential sites, with no existing support amenities, facilities, and tourism circuits to provide a complete tourist experience.

  Existing tourism assets are also generally underdeveloped or developing. For those already open for tourists, many are accessible only to local visitors coming from within Bangsamoro and neighboring regions.

  There are few tourism-related enterprises operating in the region. The majority of these are concentrated in urban centers and identified growth areas. In the mainland, hotels and accommodation facilities, as well as transport services are concentrated in Cotabato City.

  In Marawi City, a limited number of accommodations are observed in Marawi Resort, an academe-operated facility being the prime lodging option. In BaSulTa, there are no hotels, but a number of inns and resorts are available for accommodations; beach resorts however are very common.

### Ecozone Development and Freeport

A key problem to be addressed within 2023-2028 under this sub-sector is the **limited expansion of economic opportunities in industry and services**.

- **Low number of ecozone enterprises/locators registered.** The number of ecozone enterprises/locators registered has gone low due to a lot of factors. Among these are the limited number of market promotions and linkages, unimplemented program for market promotion and linkages, limited freeport and ecozone public and private engagements for investment promotion, and absence of policy that will institutionalize the operations of the economic zone. Moreover, there was no inclusion of the Investment Promotion Agency (IPA) that took place. There was also a poor coordination mechanism between the national and local government, limited data on inbound and outbound cargoes for local and international vessels, a lack of financial data of port users, no digitized revenue collections and operations systems, and a lack of skilled personnel to manage the digitized system.

- **Underdeveloped freeports and ecozones.** There were limited studies to support freeport and ecozone development. There's also a lack of Ecozone Roadmap. Moreover, there was a limited number of skilled personnel in the following: port management, maritime security, port health and safety, ecozone technical planning, tax incentives under the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (CREATE) Act, and port environment compliance. There were also unfilled permanent positions at BEZA and Polloc Freeport and Economic Zone-BARMM (PFEZ-BARMM), and most of the current employees were employed through a contract of service.

  Lamitan City offers tremendous potential for barter trading. Hence, it is imperative that a seaport be expanded in order to accommodate large sea vessels for the export of regional goods.

- **Inadequate infrastructures to support improvements required in ecozone and freeport standards.** Currently, the regional ecozone and freeport don't have modernized equipment for operations. There are unfunded wharf extensions that are essential to the operations and inadequate capital investment in infrastructures, freeport, and ecozone development. Moreover, there is no Relocation Action Plan for informal settlers in order to maximize the potential of the ecozone areas.

- **Lack of reformed freeports and ecozone policies.** There is an absence of manual operations and reformed freeports and ecozone policies that will govern and strengthen the operations of the freeport and ecozone to cover rules, and tariff rates applicable for and granting of fiscal incentives, and environmental standards imposed on freeports and ecozones. Further, the BEZA Law is yet to be established.

- **Limited number of ecozones developed.** The development of economic zones in BARMM has been one of the strategies to stimulate the economic activities and growth of the region. However, the region has still no Ecozone Development Plan that will serve as a blueprint for the development of the economic zone in the BARMM. Likewise, the required infrastructure to reinforce the industrial agglomeration in the Bangsamoro area may not be on hand. For instance, the Bangsamoro region's road density (0.10) remains the lowest in the country which is not even half of the national average (0.25). The issues on the access to electricity and water supply of the proposed ecozones to be established are yet to be addressed by the Bangsamoro Government. It cannot be overemphasized that the creation of ecozones itself does not guarantee an increase in investments, rather, the development of infrastructure facilities is the key to enhancing the investment climate in the region.

  The PFEZ-BARMM is the only existing ecozone in the region. A Final Master Plan and Feasibility Study Report was issued to PFEZ-BARMM last October 2018 that focused on addressing its port services development. The Bangsamoro region still suffers from inadequate infrastructure due to the low capital investments granted for industrial development. As a result, the ecozone generates low revenue collection for the period 2019-2021.

### Cooperatives and Social Enterprise

A key problem to be addressed under this sub-sector is the **low functionality and unsustainable profitability of cooperatives**. This is mainly due to the following:

- **Low compliance rate.** Only 11.66 percent of registered cooperatives were able to secure their certificate of compliance with the requirements set by the law. With the new proposed targets set by the sector for cooperative and social enterprise — raising the number of compliances up to 50 percent will serve as the priority challenge for the cooperative and social enterprise sub-sector.

- **Lack of enacted Code relevant to cooperative and social enterprises.** The pending codification of the Cooperative Code and Social Enterprise Code currently slows down the full operationalization and institutionalization of both Cooperatives and SE. However, the recent development of its crafting shows great potential for Bangsamoro Cooperatives and Social Enterprises (BCSE) as it went through an extensive consultation to create a code uniquely for the Bangsamoro.

- **Inadequate participation of LGUs in matters relating to cooperatives and social enterprises.** Active participation of LGUs through the inclusion of cooperative and social enterprise development in their Local Government Development plan as well as the appointment of Municipal Cooperative Officers (MCOs) will pave a way for better operationalization of cooperatives and social enterprises. However, as of now, most LGUs in the Bangsamoro Region had no appointed MCOs. Hence, regional cooperative officers find it difficult to coordinate at the LGU level. In addition, to address this issue, the establishment of provincial extension offices of CSEA is necessary.

### Labor and Employment

A key problem to be addressed under this sub-sector within the period 2023-2028 is the **lack of decent employment (insufficient employment opportunities and low-quality jobs)**. This is primarily caused by inadequate labor supply and low labor demand.

**Inadequate labor supply is mainly caused by:**

- **Insufficient number of skilled workers.** This is caused by high/increased out-migration for work and the departure of professionals and non-professionals to seek better opportunities.

- **Increased and continuing vulnerability to trafficking, forced labor, and abusive labor conditions of overseas and local workers.** This is caused by poor terms of employment and working conditions, lack of decent work and a high degree of informality, continuous operation of unscrupulous private recruitment agencies, and inability to secure work and work experience.

- **Low skilled and inexperienced human resources with low productivity (job-skills mismatch).** This is mainly due to a lack of core employability skills, which is caused by limited access to quality education and training, a high number of dropouts, and low enrolment in vocational courses.

- **Limited and/or lack of access to decent work opportunities.** This is mainly caused by a lack of knowledge and awareness of decent work opportunities and a weak infrastructure system to support access to employment/investments.

**Low labor demand** can be explained by an insufficient number of industries/companies and limited public and private labor-intensive investments.

**Amendment and adoption of applicable BFAR Fisheries Administrative Order based on the MAFAR structure.** The Fisheries Services is mandated to formulate fisheries standardized research, guidelines, policies, and procedures. Hence, the Bangsamoro Fisheries Administrative Order (BFAO) shall be created for the purpose of implementing its service mandate and to provide an effective direction in carrying out its functions which can be of effective help in ensuring the success of its implementation and objectives, pursuant to the MAFAR Structures. This serves as a guide for our regional fisheries operations and guides the implementation of the fisheries program and initiatives as a means of fostering the livelihood of our fisherfolks.

**Regional Fisheries Law Enforcement Council (RFLEC).** The law enforcement is part and partial of the operation of fisheries programs and activities to ensure efficient and effective enforcement of fishery laws, rules, and regulations. This is also providing standard operation procedures for law enforcement officers and other law enforcement partners like the coastguard, PNP, and others.

**Fisheries Adjudication Board (FAB).** The fisheries adjudication board serves as the ministry committee with sole authority to adjudicate related fishery cases in tandem with the created hearing officers of the ministry to investigate.
