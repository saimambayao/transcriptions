# Chapter 12: Improving ecological integrity, resilience of communities, and ensuring a healthy and clean environment

The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is home to 4,404,288 people. Setting its record as second fastest growing region in the country with 7.5 percent economic growth is ascribed to the natural resources present in the area as well as the region's geologic features. Indeed, its topography provides a wide range of rural livelihood opportunities including agricultural production and aquaculture. It poses a potential for economic viability through human health and social work activities, mining and quarrying, accommodation and food service activities, construction, financial and insurance activities, and other forms of industrialization.

Fostering a comprehensive framework for sustainable development in the BARMM entails proper conservation, utilization, and development of the region's natural endowment. Hence, the Bangsamoro government shall provide an enabling sound environmental policies and programs for a safe, decent, healthy, and productive environment for the present and future generations of the Bangsamoro. To achieve this, it will be necessary to employ multi-sectoral and participatory approach, involving all stakeholders in order to safeguard and improve the ecological integrity and resilience of the Bangsamoro communities.

## Sectoral Assessment

### Sectoral Trends

#### A significant portion of land in BARMM classified as forestland

Based on the 2020 Philippine Forestry Statistics (PFS), the region (excluding SGA and Cotabato City) has 665,151 hectares of forestland, accounting at 51 percent of the total land area. About 84.8 percent or 564,525 hectares, are considered as classified forestland. Lanao del Sur registers the largest classified forestland, accounting at 45 percent of the region's classified forestland. Table 12.1 shows the distribution of these forestlands by province and their respective classifications.

#### BARMM remains one of the top productive regions in mining industry

Based on PSA 2021 data and as reflected in the Mining Industry Coordinating Council (MICC) Review of Large-Scale Metallic Mining Operations in the Philippines from 2018-2020, BARMM contributed an average of 0.74 percent from 2000-2020 to the real GDP of the Philippines, particularly in the mining and quarrying industry. As shown in Table 12.5, BARMM has ten mining companies in the Mineral Production Sharing Agreement (MPSA) and four of these are active nickel mining companies in the provinces of Sulu and Tawi-Tawi.

**Table 12.5 Metallic and non-metallic minerals, by BARMM province, as of 2021**

#### Efforts to bolster solid waste management capacities are underway

Based on PSA data, there are existing 19 material recovery facilities (MRFs) and one sanitary landfill (SLF) in BARMM from 2015 to 2019. Presently, there are eight ongoing SLF construction, seven in Maguindanao, and one in Tawi-Tawi; and three are subject for site suitability assessment. Ten LGUs have secured their Environment Compliance Certificate (ECC). Moreover, 37 percent of the 119 BARMM LGUs have approved and legitimized the 10-Year SWMP. The BTA Parliament called out the LGUs neglecting proper waste disposal, and urged to implement the clustering of sanitary landfills to the adjacent municipalities to address these perennial problems.

BARMM projected waste generation has an average growth rate of 1.97 percent, which recorded 1,299.90 tons per day in 2010 to 1,608 tons per day in 2019. These projections highlight the importance of LGUs to make a long-term plan for solid waste management and upgrade its existing facilities.

**Figure 12.6 Projection of waste generation in BARMM, 2010-2019 (tons per day)**

#### High vulnerability to the ill-effects of climate change

Based on the investment case for shock responsive social protection (CSRSP) in the BARMM conducted by the Economic Policy Research Institute (EPRI) with the support of UNICEF and UNFAO, the region is particularly vulnerable to climate change, which is expected to increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. All six provinces in the region are either vulnerable or highly vulnerable to El Nino induced drought, temperature increases, and rising sea levels brought about by climate change. The region's poorest and most vulnerable households are highly exposed to naturally occurring hazards and have the least capacity to cope with or adapt to the changing climate. Moreover, vulnerable groups such as women, children, the elderly, and those with disabilities face a range of pre-existing constraints and challenges that are often compounded by disasters. For example, natural disasters often negatively impact access to basic services and deprive children of their basic rights. In addition to climate change, human-induced disaster continues to be a main driver of poverty and underdevelopment in the region. Areas with higher levels of conflict experience the highest poverty incidence and the lowest economic growth and level of human development. Moreover, families who are forced to flee their homes and communities because of conflict are exposed to heightened vulnerabilities and often become subject to additional emergencies and shocks, making a challenging return to their normal pre-emergency lives.

**Figure 12.7 Estimated number of households affected by emergencies in BARMM, 2021**

| Emergency Type | Households Affected |
|---|---|
| Natural Disaster | 98,689 |
| Conflict | 130,618 |
| Health Shock | 14,096 |

*Source: Investment Case for SRSP in the BARMM*

Most households are affected by natural disasters and conflict. In 2021, a total of 130,618 households were estimated to be affected by conflict, and 98,689 households by any sort of natural disaster. In comparison, health-related emergencies are estimated to affect a substantially lower number of households, with an average of 14,096 households being impacted each year during the 20 years projected. Finally, it should be noted that households can be affected by multiple emergencies during a year. It was estimated that on average, 10 percent of households are affected by more than one emergency throughout the modeling period of the next 20 years.

More importantly, studies show that disasters do not affect people equally. There is a high degree of heterogeneity in size, but not in the direction of the impacts on different socioeconomic groups. Inequalities in risk exposure and sensitivity to risk and access to resources, opportunities, and capabilities put specific segments of the population at a disadvantage. In BARMM, the livelihoods among agricultural households and those in the informal urban labor market are particularly vulnerable and at risk from the effects of natural disasters and climate change. Moreover, around 45 percent of BARMM's urban population live in informal settlements, making them extremely vulnerable to hazards. In the face of poverty, affected households typically have few coping strategies at their disposal, often resorting to coping mechanisms with inherent consequences on their ability to recover and rebuild or sustain their children's educational or nutritional outcomes.

The BARMM has experienced hydro-meteorological hazards such as southwest monsoon, low-pressure area (LPA), intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), continuous rain and thunderstorms, destructive and strong winds, and flooding incidents. Southwest Monsoon has the greatest number of incidents monitored and a number of displaced and affected individuals in the region, followed by flooding incidents. Further, the BARMM also experienced geological hazard incidents such as earthquakes, landslides, and erosion as monitored in the region from 2017 to 2021.

**Figure 12.8 Natural disaster incidents, BARMM, 2017-2021**

| Disaster Type | Number of Incidents |
|---|---|
| No. of Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) monitored in the Region | 14 |
| No. of Low-Pressure Area monitored in the Region | 1 |
| No. of Tornado/Destructive Winds/Strong Winds Incidence in the Region | 12 |
| No. of Southwest Monsoon Incidence in the Region | 38 |
| No. of Continuous Rains/Thunderstorms monitored in the Region | 2 |

It can be observed that there is a huge extensive flood area along the Rio Grande de Mindanao (the lowest part of the Mindanao River) and in the marsh areas. Also, landslide areas are extensive in the south-western parts of Maguindanao. Provinces of Maguindanao del Norte and Maguindanao del Sur have numerous low-lying municipalities and are considered catch basin area that experienced perennial flooding caused by weather disturbances such as southwest monsoon, ITCZ, LPA, and even heavy rains from the other regions.

**Overview of the BARMM disaster risk profile.** Despite the availability of natural resources, the region is no stranger to various disasters present in the Philippine archipelago due to its physical structure and geographic location. BARMM is composed of the six provinces: Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao del Norte, and Maguindanao del Sur are within the mainland Mindanao, while Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi are island provinces in the southwest Mindanao. Also included in the region are the SGA and Cotabato City.

**Natural hazards.** The region is also known to be prone to natural hazards such as flooding, flash floods, rain-induced landslides, storm surges, and volcanic activities that yield physical damages and economic losses to the people and communities in BARMM. Below are the hazard maps and corresponding data provided by various government agencies operating and monitoring the continuous occurrence of these natural hazards within the region.

Aside from natural hydrometeorological and geologic hazards, there are skirmishes and armed conflict which added another layer of consideration with regards to DRRM implementation. In late 2019, the country, including this region, also faced another challenge related to health emergencies with the breakout of the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Disaster incidents monitored and their impacts.** The region has experienced hydrometeorological hazards such as southwest monsoon, LPA, ITCZ, continuous rain and thunderstorms, strong destructive winds, and storm surges. These have been exposing vulnerable communities to risks of flooding which resulted in a considerable number of affected or displaced families, as shown in the Table 12.7.

**Table 12.7 Summary of disaster/incident report monitored, January 2021 to May 30, 2022**

| Type of Disaster/Incident | Total No. of Incidents 2021 | Total No. of Incidents 2022 | No. of Displaced/Affected Families 2021 | No. of Displaced/Affected Families 2022 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fire | 4 | 9 | 287 | 336 |
| Flooding | 19 | 28 | 109,982 | 26,630 |

*Source: Bangsamoro READi*

Flooding has the greatest number of incidents monitored in the region for the past two years, followed by fire. These and other monitored incidences of earthquakes, landslides, and erosion from 2017 to 2021 could be attributed to the geologic structure of the region.

In 2018, the continued reoccurrence of very high flooding (VHF) posts a severe concern in the majority of the land area within the region, particularly in the provinces of Maguindanao del Norte and Maguindanao del Sur totaling 91,817 hectares which is roughly 2.5 percent of the total land area of the region affected by VHF. These provinces are also the most susceptible to all types of flooding affecting 190,156 hectares, which is 19.07 percent of the total land area of the provinces.

Moderate landslides (ML) have affected the most total land area in the region adding up to 301,797 hectares which makes up 8.2 percent of the entire region.

Lanao del Sur is the most susceptible to all types of landslides affecting 294,463 hectares which is 19.5 percent of the total land area of the province. Cotabato City, which is considered to be the most urbanized area in the region, has the least incidence of landslides compared to the other provinces in the region.

**Disaster interventions.** Interventions in DRRM covers the four thematic areas namely:

**Table 12.10 BARMM Disaster Risk Reduction and Management**

| Thematic Area | Lead Ministry, Office, Agency |
|---|---|
| Prevention and Mitigation | Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST-BARMM) |
| Preparedness | Ministry of Interior and Local Government (MILG-BARMM) |
| Response | Ministry of Social Services and Development (MSSD-BARMM) |
| Rehabilitation and Recovery | Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority (BPDA) |

*Source: Bangsamoro READi*

Other member BARMM MOAs of the Bangsamoro DRRM Council (BDRRMC) also contribute to the implementation of programs, projects, and activities under the abovementioned thematic areas.

**Response to natural and human-induced disaster incidences.** Recurring armed conflicts and frequent flooding incidents in low-lying areas especially in Maguindanao del Norte, Maguindanao del Sur, and Lanao del Sur caused by continuous rainfalls in the BARMM and Northern Mindanao resulted in a high number of affected families. From 2021 to mid-2022, distribution of relief assistance was recorded by the Bangsamoro READi and reached 657,170 affected families of both natural and human-induced disasters in the region, including health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

The huge number of relief assistance distributed is due to the prioritization of disaster response by the Bangsamoro government and the consequent creation of the Bangsamoro READi which is tasked to respond to at least 20 percent of the affected population within 72 hours upon the occurrence of a disaster. Aside from the quick response mechanism of the said office, the MSSD also lead the disaster response cluster and provide response interventions to the affected communities.

**Disaster-related local plans in BARMM.** Relevant to the local government's unwavering support for improving community resilience in the region, there has been a notable increase in the number of Local DRRM Plans (LDRRMPs) for 2019 to 2022. From 111 in 2016 to 2019, the submitted LDRRMPs to the OCD-BARMM has risen to 123. Also, a total of 41 Local CCA Plans (LCCAPs) were approved from 2016 to 2019.

The increase in the number of the approved LDRRMPs in 2019 to 2022 can be attributed to the efforts of the MILG and other BARMM MOAs in providing technical assistance to the LGUs and rigorous monitoring through different programs such as SGLG and Gawad Kalasag of OCD-BARMM, where approved LDRRMPs and LCCAPs are required. The trend of LCCAP for 2019 to 2022 is yet to be determined, as the LGUs are currently in the process of updating their respective LCCAPs.

**Figure 12.16 Number of approved LDRRMP and LCCAP in BARMM, 2020**

| Province | LDRRMP | LCCAP |
|---|---|---|
| Lanao del Sur | 40 | 16 |
| Maguindanao | 37 | 20 |
| Basilan | 12 | 4 |
| Sulu | 20 | 1 |
| Tawi-Tawi | 14 | - |

The delay in the updating of LGUs' local plans is due to some imposed restrictions and postponement against COVID-19 pandemic and the adjustments of the component LGUs to the new dynamics of the Bangsamoro government.

## Opportunities

**Rehabilitation and reforestation of 14,806 hectares of the region's forestland.** Accordingly, the MENRE had rehabilitated 14,806 hectares of the BARMM forestland from 2019 to 2021. This is in line with the implementation of the Integrated Bangsamoro Greening Program (IBGP) which is one of the priority projects of the ministry in support of the normalization program. The IBGP was institutionalized through EO 0007 series of 2020 which aims to hire those soon-to-be decommissioned MILF-BIAF members as Palaw Rangers. They will serve as implementer of IBGP activities and related development interventions in the target areas and municipalities. The program also aims to grow 171.2 million trees/propagules covering about 159,000 hectares in BARMM forestlands such as those open and denuded, mangrove and protected areas, including watersheds, ancestral domains, and civil and military reservations.

**Establishment of Document Tracking and Archiving of Land Records and Patent Applications (DALPA) tracking systems.** The established DALPA tracking systems are meant to address fragmented land record systems, eradicate red tapes, facilitate and expedite land processing, and reduce time intervals on the approval of land patent applications. It will help in the achievement of social justice for the landless and contribute to the resolution of protracted land conflict between land owners and claimants. Based on the initial time-motion study of the 52 land patent applications, it had taken 10 to 15 days before it reached the MENRE Regional Office from one to three months of endorsement. Around 65 land application transactions were subjected to DALPA, while 11 are already approved, 11 transactions are completed, 48 are active, and six are closed.

**44 LGUs complied the 10-Year SWMP.** To ensure the compliance of the LGUs to RA 9003, the MENRE, through Environment Management Services (EMS), provides technical assistance in the formulation and implementation of their 10-Year SWM Plan particularly in the segregation at source or segregated collection, MRF per barangay or cluster of barangays, prohibition against the operation of open and controlled dumpsites and safe disposal, and operation of SLF.

As of second quarter of 2022, the MENRE, along with the National SWM Commission (NSWMC) and the MILG with their TAHARA program, assisted and facilitated the preparation of 92 SWMPs in the BARMM which include 44 approved and legitimized LGUs and the remaining 48 LGUs are subject to evaluation. Furthermore, these offices also conducted an assessment of site suitability for SLF of 11 LGUs with ongoing construction and operational status for the prohibition against the operation of open and controlled dumpsites and safe disposal.

In 2021, a resolution requesting the BEDC to approve the creation of a Sub-Committee on Regional SWM (SCRSWM) was established under the RLUC. The SCRSWM will serve as a policy-making body to provide support in the implementation of the RA 9003 or the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000 in the BARMM.

The success of SWM initiatives will contribute in the protection of public health and environment, and promotion of livelihood and economic opportunities for the recycling sector.

**Piloted geological mapping and rock/mineral sampling.** To further develop the mineral potential of the region, the need to conduct geological survey of mineral resources through the Mines and Geosciences Services (MGS) is significant to fuel the various development strategies and encourage LGUs to be involved in the drafting of development courses for the mineral industry. The Mineral Resources and Geosciences Development Program ensures that the mineral resources are sustainably managed and utilized as drivers for regional development of the BARMM.

Moreover, MENRE conducted its first geologic mapping and assessment in Upi, Maguindanao. The field work encompasses the entire municipality of Upi, journeying through existing road networks and river traverses to locate rock outcrops. Geologists locate the outcrop on the database and take rock samples from the outcrop. These rock samples were sent to the laboratory for analysis.

**Piloted geohazard assessment and mapping.** As the pioneering work of the Geological Risk Reduction and Resiliency Program of the MGS, the activity entitled "Geohazard Assessment and Mapping" was conducted by MGS-MENRE on November 15 to 27, 2021 to assess the entire region regarding geohazards present in the municipality of Kabuntalan, Maguindanao, and provide maps that show the vulnerability of the local population and infrastructure against such hazards.

**Community-Based Forest Management Agreements (CBFMAs) covers 36,315.26 hectares of forestlands in BARMM.** At the end of 2019, the BARMM, through the MENRE, entered into CBFMA with 21 people's organizations (POs), cooperatives, and associations in Lanao del Sur with six CBFMAs at 15,327.82 hectares; Maguindanao with 11 CBFMAs at 15,512.04 hectares; Sulu with one CBFMA at 4,527.40 hectares; and Tawi-Tawi with three CBFMAs at 948.00 hectares of forestlands. These 21 CBFMA holders are responsible for the protection of the entire forestlands within their CBFMA area against illegal logging and the other unauthorized extraction of forest products, slash-and-burn agriculture (kaingin) forest and grassland fires, and other forms of forest destruction; and to assist MENRE in the prosecution of violators of forestry and environmental laws.

**BARMM shows revenue increase in the mining industry within the last three years.** Historical performance of the revenue generated from 2016 to 2018 showed an increase of 61 percent and its collected revenue has a total of Php561,393,159.60 from 2019 to 2021. These mining regional tax, fees, and charges are collected and remitted to the coffers of the Bangsamoro Treasury.

**20 million pesos annual budget allocated for the Coastal Resource Management (CRM) component of the Fisheries Coastal Resources and Livelihood (FishCORAL) project.** Based on the Supervision Report of the FishCORAL project in March 2021, BARMM received Php20 million annual budget allocation for its 11 LGUs intended for CRM. This project component aims to improve the condition of coastal resources in the target bays and gulfs by increasing municipal fisheries production. The project seeks to contribute in reducing the poverty incidence in the coastal communities of the 11 target bays and gulfs in the country including Illana Bay and Sulu Sea, with funding support from the International Fund for Agriculture and Development (IFAD).

Furthermore, the BARMM have already enacted their respective bay wide unified fishery ordinance (UFO). According to the report, only BARMM and CARAGA have seagrass beds protection with a low overall project-wide accomplishment at 15 percent or 516 out of 3,814 hectares. In BARMM, there is perceived increase in the coastal assets with seagrass bed and with six ordinances approved on the role of seagrass beds in the blue economy integrating it into carbon trading. Increase of sea cucumber, crustaceans, and seaweeds have been observed in the protected seagrass beds. Moreover, major bulk of artificial reefs (ARs) of 2,152 units is in BARMM which showed an increase in fish density and coral recruitment on the blocks.

**Thousand individuals capacitated on DRRM.** A total of 1,350 local DRRM officers and council members, partners, private sectors, academic institutions, and community members underwent various DRRM trainings provided by the BARMM MOAs from 2020 to 2021. These capacity-building interventions revolve around the four thematic areas of DRRM, namely, disaster prevention and mitigation, disaster preparedness, disaster response, and disaster rehabilitation and recovery. Trainings provided include but are not limited to Basic DRRM Training, Climate and Disaster Risk Assessment, LCCAP, Community-Based DRRM, LDRRMP, Incident Command System (ICS), Rehabilitation and Recovery Planning, Management of the Dead and Missing, Protection and Camp Management, various search and rescue trainings, contingency planning, and other training courses. On the other hand, the LGUs capacitated on various DRRM trainings also provide capacity-building training, seminars, and orientation to their respective communities and local sectors.

**Formulation and adoption of DRR and CCA-pertinent laws and policies.** The formulation of national laws and policies pertinent to environmental protection and management provides the cornerstone for the promotion of climate change-adaptive communities in the region. At the outset, the enactment of the Pollution Control Law (PD 984), Philippine Environment Code (PD 1152), Clean Air Act of 1999 (RA 8749), and the Philippine Clean Water Act (RA 9275) provide the necessary bases for the formulation of policies and conduct of programs and activities to address environmental and CCA-related issues such as pollution and global warming. Other laws supportive of this agenda are the RA 6969 or Toxic Substances and Hazardous Waste Control Act, RA 9003 or Ecological Solid Waste Management Act, and EO 26 or the Establishment of Smoke-Free Environments in Public and Enclosed Places.

In terms of managing natural resources, the RA 9072 or National Cave Resources Management Protection Act, RA 8435 or Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act, RA 7492 or Philippine Mining Act, and EO 263 or the Adoption of Community-Based Forest Management as the National Strategy to Ensure the Sustainable Development of the Country's Forestlands Resources and Providing Mechanisms for its implementation. These laws offer an essential guide in formulating and implementing relevant laws and policies to ensure proper environmental care and protection. Also, these include other laws and policies as follows:

- The DENR Administrative Order No. 15-90: Establishing Regulations Governing the Utilization, Development, and Management of Mangrove Resources;
- EO 533: Adopting Integrated Coastal Management as a National Strategy to Ensure the Sustainable Development of the Country's Coastal and Marine Environment and Resources and Establishing Supporting Mechanisms for its Implementation;
- EO 578: Establishing the National Policy on Biological Diversity, Prescribing its Implementation throughout the Country, particularly in the Sulu Sulawesi Marine Ecosystem and the Verde Island Passage Marine Corridor; and
- RA 7942: An Act Instituting a New System of Mineral Resources Exploration, Development, Utilization, and Conservation

At the regional level, the MENRE issued MC 08 series of 2019 providing policy on the issuance of tenurial instruments and harvesting permits within forestlands. Likewise, rules and regulations implementing EO 004 governing the AO 05 series 2022 or the Community-Based Forest Restoration and Management Program in the BARMM were also formulated.

Furthermore, the RA 9729 or Climate Change Act of 2009 provides an opportunity for the LGUs to mainstream climate change into their respective PPAs.

In the DRR aspect, the development of the National DRRM Framework upon which the Bangsamoro DRRM Plan shall be aligned would pave the way for more enhanced programming across all thematic areas of DRRM. Another opportunity is the establishment of various NDRRMC guidelines that would possibly lead to devising a strategic DRRM plan of action or updating existing regional policies and other DRRM legislations. These include the following:

- Memo No. 083 series of 2022: Guidelines on Camp Coordination and Camp Management and Internally-Displaced Persons Protection;
- Memo No. 067 series of 2022: Accreditation of Community Disaster Volunteers (ACDV) Online Platform;
- Memo No. 112 series of 2021: Guidelines on the Philippine Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) National Accreditation Process;
- MC No. 63 series of 2021: Amended Guidelines on the Conduct of Pre-Disaster Risk Assessment (PDRA);
- Memo Order No. 012 series of 2021: Inclusion of DITO Telecommunity in Disseminating EAWM;
- Memo No. 45 series of 2017: Guidelines on the Administration of NDRRM Fund;
- Memo Circular No. 19 series of 2016: Rules and Regulations Governing the Implementation of the Management of the Dead and Missing Persons;
- Memo No. 43 series of 2016: Guidelines on the Interoperability of Incident Management Teams (IMTs) and Response Clusters; and
- Memo Circular No. 04 series of 2012: Implementing Guidelines on the Use of Incident Management System (ICS) as an On-Scene Disaster Risk Response and Management Mechanism under the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management System (PDRRMS).

**Implementation of regional programs and projects for DRR-CCA.** A number of interrelated factors drive the emergence of informal settlements in the region. Economic vulnerability is one of the many reasons for the growing population in the region's rural areas. The MENRE and MAFAR have latent capacities in addressing existing and future environmental and livelihood issues leading to natural or human-induced disasters.

The IBGP by MENRE is perceived to help prevent or at least mitigate the adverse effect of climate change arising from deforestation. The MAFAR's land distribution and development for the upliftment of poor ARBs, when incorporated into DRR programming, have the potential to contribute positively in resolving land dispute-triggered conflicts, while its BINHI and ISDA programs can provide essential support for the recovery of disaster-stricken communities.

In addition, the full utilization of the NDRRMC monitoring dashboard helps provide essential baseline data for improved planning and program prioritization. It can also serve as a model for the development of DRRM-relevant software and information systems. Moreover, the Gawad KALASAG Seal and Special Awards for Excellence in DRRM and humanitarian assistance could be a motivational factor for LGUs to enhance their respective DRRM plans.

Since 2020, BARMM allocates 5 percent of its annual block grant to help fund DRRM programs in the region. Creating a regional fund for DRRM allows the region to locally design and fund response programs within the different BARMM MOAs, which are then deliberated upon and approved by the Bangsamoro government, as opposed to the national government. Similar to the national DRRMF, the regional fund has the calamity fund for relief, recovery and rehabilitation services, and a quick response fund to be accessed by first responder BARMM MOAs.

## Priority Challenges to be addressed in 2023-2028

**Over 80 percent of open and denuded land in BARMM have yet to be rehabilitated.** Deforestation in BARMM are caused by uninterrupted impurity of the watershed site, rampant cutting of forest products, slash and burn cultivation, charcoal making, kaingin, conversion of the parcel into personal interest, uncontrolled growth of forest occupants, illegal dumping of community waste materials, and quarrying in the forest without nurturing an assistance. This will result to the drop of water supply, increase emission of greenhouse gases that results into global warming, as well as, the loss of the wildlife habitat, particularly endemic species.

In October 2021, the MENRE identified about 178,264 hectares of open and denuded forests needing rehabilitation. An estimated 90,000 hectares of which are situated in Maguindanao provinces.

**Only 2.0 percent of BARMM LGUs have operational sanitary landfill (SLF) facilities in 2021.** In compliance with RA 9003 or the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000, the Bangsamoro government conducted a series of inspections of the ongoing construction of a SLF to ensure that it is designed according to the guidelines and requirements stated in the said law.

The law prohibits open dumpsites and instead requires SLF as the final disposal site for solid and residual wastes of a municipality. The municipalities of Parang, Maguindanao del Norte and Wao, Lanao del Sur have received their commendation for the establishment of a SLF on July 7, 2021. Presently, there are eight ongoing SLF construction, seven in Maguindanao, and one in Tawi-Tawi; and three are subject for site suitability assessment. Ten LGUs have secured their ECC. Moreover, 37 percent of the 119 BARMM LGUs have approved and legitimized the 10-Year SWMP. The BTA Parliament called out the LGUs neglecting proper waste disposal, and urged to implement the clustering of sanitary landfills to the adjacent municipalities to address these perennial problems.

**Table 12.12 Sanitary Landfill Status, 11 BARMM LGUs, as of 2021**

**Vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change.** Notwithstanding the risks, informal settlements in danger zones and protected areas, as well as unregulated urbanization, proliferate in some parts of the region. Both contribute to environmental degradation including pollution, loss of biodiversity, and ecological imbalance. Consequently, these constitute such hazards as the emission of greenhouse gasses, the leading cause of global warming and climate change. Similarly, improper waste management and depletion of waterways thereupon cause flooding and other environmental problems. Forest denudation, river siltation, and illegal fishing further contribute to increased environmental vulnerabilities.

**Susceptibility to human-induced disasters.** Scarcity of resources as an effect of climate change is among the factors contributory to the occurrence of armed conflicts in the region. Along with population growth, is an increasing demand for natural resources that would help sustain the continuing regional development. As with BARMM, the presence of lawless elements and peace detractors in some areas, as well as the unresolved political and ideological issues, adds another challenge to reducing human-induced vulnerabilities in the region.

**Capacity of communities in DRR-CCA.** Local and indigenous knowledge of disaster preparedness plays a pivotal role in DRR as it complements science and technology in reducing the impacts of hazards and disasters. Nevertheless, vague awareness overshadows the benefit of community-based DRRM due to preoccupation with day-to-day livelihood and means of living preventing members of the community from participating in DRRM-CCA activities such as drills, seminars, and policy development. These can also be attributed to some constraints such as few existing mechanisms to compensate participants for training on disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation.

Apart from that, there is also a limited presence of enhanced or upgraded early warning systems. Some members of the community lack or may not even be aware of its existence in their respective communities.

**Capacity and capabilities of Local Councils and Officers for DRRM Programming.** In the areas of disaster mitigation or prevention and preparedness, baseline and spatial data including updated hazard maps form part of the essential references for efficient DRRM. While it includes but is not limited to air, water, land, mineral deposits, and other biodiversity indexes on the CCA aspect, it includes vulnerability and risk assessment and impact as well as disaster incidence analytics on the other. Insufficiency of which as a result of an absence of an improved data banking facility or centralized data repository, as well as enhanced information management systems and related technologies, could result in ineffective DRR planning, thus affecting the quality of future decision-making and disaster response.

In terms of climate and disaster risk assessments, the technical capacity of LGUs requires further enhancement. There are limited plantilla positions for government personnel focused on DRR concerns at the provincial and municipal levels. Far-flung areas are not also reached by duty bearers when conducting capacity-building and other relevant training.

At the local levels, not all plans have COVID or Emerging/Re-Emerging Infectious Diseases (EREID) considerations. There is also limited availability of inclusive plans and programs for gender, cultural, and PWD-sensitive humanitarian response and relief assistance for displaced victims. Institutionalized plans and programs for rehabilitation and recovery are likewise inadequate to cater to the growing needs of the communities.

**Impact of unclean and unhealthy environment threatens the region's ecosystem.** The structural shift of the region's economy toward a service-oriented sector has improved the economic performance of BARMM. However, every development at specific times and locations may have environmental risks when production and consumption are not properly and sustainably managed. Some areas in BARMM, particularly its highly urbanized cities like Cotabato City and Marawi City, are more susceptible to environmental hazards caused by land, air, and water pollution. Improper solid waste disposal remained rampant in the region due to lack of SLFs and insufficient technical skills of the LGUs on SWMP implementation. Moreover, insufficient budget for waste management and disposal remains a challenge for many LGUs in BARMM.

Also, the BARMM's rivers, lakes, and marine resources suffer from improper waste disposal that is widespread among the local villages and commercial entities along the lake, river, and coastal shorelines. This could be attributed to the weak enforcement of environmental laws and policies at all levels of government. With the absence of accredited Pollution Control Officers for industries and lack of appropriate air quality monitoring stations and equipment in the region, the region's ecosystem and environment are highly at risk.

Furthermore, the Bangsamoro government still faces difficulties in raising environmental awareness through information and educational campaigns among the BARMM constituents. Many local businesses are still ignorant of or negligent about their environmental responsibilities.

**Information on risk assessment and geohazards is still scarce among environmental authorities.** The MENRE continues to struggle with its limited technical knowledge on vulnerability risk assessment (VRA). To assist the LGUs technically, environmental authorities must possess the necessary knowledge. As of right now, the MENRE is still having trouble creating geohazard maps of the BARMM LGUs, which show locations vulnerable to environmental dangers. The management and preparation for disasters can both benefit from this map.

**Ineffective management of BARMM natural resources.** The BARMM is currently struggling with the lack of baseline data on the condition of the coral reefs, grass beds, marine ecology, and other coastal resources in the area. This can be a result of the area's inadequate roadmap on sustainable forest management in the region. Given the limited number of skilled wildlife handlers, a wildlife and rescue center in the region has yet to be established which could cater the protection and preservation of the wildlife and biodiversity. Hence, it would be more challenging for the environmental authorities to manage the loss of biodiversity or habitat fragmentation and other protected areas of the Bangsamoro region without the aforementioned baseline data and facility.

In addition, illegal logging, timber poaching, influx of forest occupants, widespread kaingin and charcoal-making activities led to the denudation of the region's forests. This could be properly addressed if the Provincial Anti-illegal Logging Task Force (PAILTF) in the region is active. Collaboration between and among LGUs, industries, state security personnel, and other stakeholders in forest rehabilitation are still weak.

The absence of equipment-support and capacity development on Land Administration Management Systems (LAMS) in BARMM resulted in the recurring issues on fragmented land records, inequitable land distribution, and land grabbing.

Exploitation of mines and mineral resources in BARMM are still under regulation with the absence of the Bangsamoro Responsible Mining Act and the limited engagement of the Bangsamoro government with the multi-partite monitoring team on mining. The sustainable management and exploration of the region's mining and mineral resources were hampered by a lack of baseline data on mineral resources and laboratory equipment for rock sampling analysis.

**Illegal poaching on BARMM waters.** The Bangsamoro region is known for its rich fishing ground and marine resources. However, lack of policy and regulation on the delineation and demarcation of the BARMM municipal waters led to illegal poaching by foreign fishermen, affecting the fish catch of local fisherfolks, particularly in the island provinces.

**Impact of environmental hazards.** It can be observed that there is a huge extensive flood area along the Rio Grande de Mindanao (the lowest part of the Mindanao River) and in the marsh areas, and landslide areas are also extensive in the south-western areas of Maguindanao.

Maguindanao provinces have a number of low-lying municipalities and is considered catch basin areas that experienced perennial flooding affected by weather disturbances such as southwest monsoon, ITCZ, LPA, and even heavy rains from the other regions. Despite this, there are limited flood control projects such as proper drainage systems and their maintenance thereof to properly discharge wastewater, rainwater, and run-offs.

It has also been noted that earthquakes have the greatest number of incidents in the region, especially in the year 2019 when there exists a series of earthquake events. Many faults and trenches were located around the Bangsamoro region as shown in the figure, causing the occurrence of these epicenters are located around faults and trenches. The latest destructive earthquake occurred in 1976 and its epicenter was near the Cotabato Trench in the Moro Gulf. After the earthquake, a local tsunami hit the coastal area in the region and caused serious damage.

**Rising sea levels in the coastal areas of BARMM island provinces.** The common risk and vulnerability in the BARMM island provinces are the rising sea levels that greatly affect their communities. This has led to flooding, strong storm surges, and erosion of beaches/land in the coastal areas of BARMM island provinces.

**Weak enforcement of land use policies on no-build zones and other environmental laws and policies.** Though recognized as among the apparent solutions to the unrestrained expansion of population and unregulated urbanization, the formulation of the Regional CLUP and the PDPFP carries with their implementation several challenges due to varying constraints and considerations. Addressing the limitations concerning the enforcement of such policies is among the primary concerns of this plan.

Despite the availability of sound environmental laws, the region still faces challenges when it comes to implementation. Apart from limited baseline data on the quality of air, water, mineral deposits, and other biodiversity indexes, strong collaboration among implementing and law enforcement agencies is required. Capacity-building for environmental and natural resources ENR officers is equally needed to fill in the knowledge gap on existing laws, rules, and regulations.

**Insufficient investment on DRR-CCA programs and inadequate capacity of DRR CCA personnel.** Some of the identified challenges in DRR-CCA programming and implementation are agency coordination and management of available resources. From prevention to disaster recovery and rehabilitation, DRR-CCA initiatives require adequate capacities/capabilities from government instrumentalities as well as implementing and partner agencies. This is enabled through sufficient budget allocation as well as skilled personnel that shall formulate and translate plans into working solutions. Continuous engagement of the community and improved collaboration among key stakeholders is vital to the overall success of risk reduction associated with natural and human-induced disasters.

Anticipatory actions on disaster prevention and mitigation shall also be enhanced at the regional and local levels.

## Priority Strategies and Programs

### Priority Strategies

To improve the region's ecological integrity and community resilience for a healthy, safe, and sustainable environment in the Bangsamoro, the following strategies shall be guaranteed:

**Strategy 1: Ensure effective management of Bangsamoro natural resources.** This will be undertaken through strict enforcement of environmental laws and regulations on forest protection and management, no-build zones, pollution control, and protection of watersheds and protected areas. With this, social safeguards for coastal and mineral resources development in BARMM will be strictly managed and protected.

**Strategy 2: Enhance protection and rehabilitation of BARMM's forestlands, watersheds, coastal marine resources, inland and wetland resources, and protected areas.** The Bangsamoro government shall adopt a sustainable roadmap on forest management and intensify efforts on rehabilitation, reforestation, and development of open and denuded forestlands in BARMM. Research and development on forest, watershed, and biodiversity will be strengthened by building robust collaboration between and among LGUs, industries, state security personnel, academe, and other stakeholders in forest rehabilitation. With this, a baseline data on wildlife, coastal marine resources, inland and wetland resources will be established and maintained. While, management and development of protected areas will be pursued by investing on socially-cohesive development initiatives on environment and natural resources, as well as, harmonizing all greening efforts of the Bangsamoro government, CSOs, people's organizations, and private sector to achieve greater impact.

**Strategy 3: Foster partnership with LGUs in the implementation of Forest Land Use Plans (FLUPs) and Comprehensive Land Use Plans (CLUPs) and zoning ordinances.** In support to Strategy No. 2, the Bangsamoro government shall continuously assist and collaborate with LGUs in the formulation and implementation of their respective FLUPs and CLUPs and zoning ordinances. This includes the conduct of watershed characterization and vulnerability assessment as basis for the development and conservation strategies to be implemented in BARMM for the sustainable management of watershed resources in the region. This also include provision of capacity building for LGUs on planning and management of land resources. Moreover, awareness and advocacy campaigns on no-build zones and watershed protection shall likewise be intensified using quad media and/or different social media platforms.

**Strategy 4: Strengthen land administration and management system (LAMS) in BARMM.** In relation to Strategy No. 3, partnership between and among land-related agencies from the national, regional, and local governments shall be pursued to strengthen and improve the current LAMS in BARMM. This is to ensure that integrity and access to land information such as cadastral maps, isolated survey plans, public land applications, patents and titles are managed and administered properly. It also ensures the quick processing of land transactions and updating of land records, as well as the tracking of applications undergoing processing. Hence, this system will provide effective management of land records and efficient delivery of land transactions and information services to the public.

**Strategy 5: Intensify engagement with the multi-partite monitoring team in mining industry in BARMM.** In support to Strategy No. 1, monitoring of mining and quarrying activities in the region shall be intensified by deputizing Pollution Control Officers for industries operating in BARMM to monitor their compliance on environmental laws and regulations. Hence, a multi-partite monitoring team in mining industry shall be pursued to regulate mining and quarrying activities, while promoting the development of the mineral potential of the BARMM by ensuring that mining and quarrying companies and establishments are committed to observe their corporate social responsibility (CSR) by taking responsibility for the impact of their activities on the communities and environment.

**Strategy 6: Ensure clean and healthy environment in BARMM.** This will be undertaken through adoption and proper implementation of regional, provincial, municipal, and barangay SWMPs and closure of open dumpsite and development of sanitary landfills in BARMM.

Moreover, the Bangsamoro government shall institutionalize air and water quality monitoring systems in BARMM by establishing air and water quality management stations with equipment in strategic locations in the region to ensure that the environment and public health are protected from the dangers of air and water pollution. This will also include strict monitoring of industrial facilities with potential to emit gases that contribute to global warming and dispose toxic and hazardous wastes. Information gathered in these systems will be used for sound planning and decision making in reducing carbon footprints in BARMM and preserve the region's natural resources. With this, regular conduct of greenhouse gases (GHG) emission inventory and information drive on air and water pollution will be intensified.

**Strategy 7: Enhance disaster resilience and climate change adaptive capacity of communities in the Bangsamoro.** This will be carried out through mainstreaming of DRR and CCA into the regional and local development plans at all levels of government, involving the active participation of the private sector, local communities, and the civil society. This is to ensure that the long-term prevention, mitigation, preparedness, and rehabilitation plans of the regional and local governments will respond and hasten the reconstruction and rehabilitation interventions after a disaster and define mitigation and preparedness activities that can reduce damage before disasters happen. Thus, preventive measures such as implementation of multiple hazard mapping activities to characterize natural hazards, analysis of hazard and potential risks, establishment of early warning system and communication for enhanced anticipatory disaster risk management and strengthening of the LGU capabilities on disaster management must be carefully undertaken.

Generally, this strategy will ensure vertical alignment of the local DRRM plans of LGUs to the different national and regional plans on DRR and CCA. Hence, locally-led climate and disaster risk assessment and its mainstreaming in all pertinent LGU plans will also be supported and improved.

**Strategy 8: Prioritize DRRM-CCA investment and programming focused on reducing climate and disaster risk of the vulnerable sectors.** In support to Strategy No. 7, the Bangsamoro government shall support the provision of the required budgetary resources to DRR and CCA programs and projects at the regional, provincial, municipal, and barangay levels, targeting the affected vulnerable sectors. This will also include the adoption and/or formulation of data-driven anticipatory and participatory action plan involving partners and key stakeholders in government, CSOs, NGOs, and private sectors.

Furthermore, the Bangsamoro government shall assist eligible LGUs and local/community organizations (LCOs) in accessing the People's Survival Fund (PSF) of the national government. This disaster risk financing was set up in 2012 to provide long stream financing for adaptation projects of LGUs and community organizations to increase the resilience of communities to climate change.

**Strategy 9: Intensify engagement of the communities, vulnerable and marginalized sectors, government, and private sectors.** In line with Strategy Nos. 7 and 8, DRR and CCA actions of the national, regional, and local plans shall be properly coordinated and consulted with the Bangsamoro communities, vulnerable and marginalized sectors, government and private sectors, including CSOs, NGOs, people's organizations (POs), and volunteer organizations (VOs) in the Bangsamoro. This will be done through the establishment, promotion, and implementation of the Community Resilience Program at all levels of government, including the private sector, local communities, and the civil society.

**Strategy 10: Strengthen implementation of pertinent DRRM and CCA laws, rules, regulations, plans, and policies.** The Bangsamoro government shall harmonize existing mechanisms and systems at the regional, local, and community levels to strengthen the implementation of DRR and CCA laws, rules, regulations, plans, and policies. This will also support Strategy Nos. 7-9 in ensuring that community-based early warning systems are updated and in place and that community members are oriented about them to prevent and mitigate effects of emergencies.
