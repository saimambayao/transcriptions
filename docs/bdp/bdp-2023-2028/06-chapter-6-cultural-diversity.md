# Chapter 6: Mainstreaming of Bangsamoro Cultural Diversity, Beliefs, Heritage, and Identity

Section 24, Article IX of RA 11054 known as the BOL provides that the Bangsamoro government shall preserve the history, culture, arts, traditions, and the rich cultural heritage of the Bangsamoro people and their Sultanates, such as those of Sulu, Maguindanao, Kabuntalan, Buayan, the Royal House of Ranao and of the Iranun, and the non-Moro indigenous peoples of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

Pursuant to the said provision of the BOL, the Bangsamoro government identified Bangsamoro culture, heritage, identity, and diversity as the twelfth priority of the enhanced 12-Point Priority Agenda of the BARMM. This chapter aims to contribute in Agenda No. 7 of the 8-Point Socioeconomic Agenda of the Marcos Administration, and SDGs 10, 11, and 17.

It also sets forth the goal, objectives, strategies, and priority interventions laid out by the Bangsamoro government for the next six years. This features the unique culture and identity of the BARMM.

## Sectoral Assessment

### Sectoral Trends

**Bangsamoro culture and identity recognized.** The term Moro is a diverse category, with great variation culturally and linguistically, as well as in religiosity and the adherence to Islamic teachings (Paredes, 2015). It was initially a derogatory term applied by the Spanish colonizers who battled the 'Moors' in the Iberian Peninsula - modern Spain and Portugal, implemented aggressive anti-Muslim policies.

The Maguindanaon, Meranao, Iranun or Iranaun, Tausug, Yakan, and other cultural groups retain distinct traditions and identities, their shared historical identification with Islam and a shared history of being targeted by colonial and post-colonial state persecution (ibid). Over time, the term Moro was eventually embraced as a collective identifier. Most recently, the term is prefixed by the Malay word "Bangsa", which means nation, to suggest a collective name for all Moro peoples in the Philippines and their homeland.

The Bangsamoro diverse culture and identity have been historically recognized in different literatures as basis of identifying and naming the sea between the island of Mindanao and Palawan as Sulu Sea, the country's largest gulf located in the off coast of Mindanao as Moro Gulf and, a large bay of the Moro Gulf, off the southwestern coast of Mindanao island as Ilana Bay, also known as the Iranun/Iranaun Bay. In fact, the island of Mindanao was identified and named as Moro land during the American regime. It was administered separately from the islands of Visayas and Luzon until the promulgation of the 1935 Philippine Constitution despite the vehement resistance of the Bangsamoro.

Bangsamoro culture and identity is also legally recognized through the provision of the 1987 Constitution particularly Article X, Section 15, which provides among others that "There shall be created an Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao." Presidential Decree 1083 was decreed allowing the Muslims to exercise their own law on personal and property relation other than the Philippine Civil Code. This led to the creation of Shari'ah legal system including Shari'ah Courts in the country.

Another recognition is the establishment of Ministry of Muslim Affairs (MMA) by virtue of EO 697 issued on May 28, 1981, which was replaced by the Office on Muslim Affairs (OMA) two months later to minimize the number of ministries at that time. It was replaced by the National Commission of Muslim Filipinos (NCMF) by virtue of RA 9997 known as National Commission on Muslim Filipinos Act of 2009. Eventually, the enactment of RA 6734 as amended by RA 9054 and finally eventual passage of RA 11054 known as the BOL.

**Appreciation of Bangsamoro culture and identity is gradually decreasing.** The Bangsamoro are known for their rich and distinct beliefs, culture, and identity for which they fought for and struggled many decades and even centuries before. The battle cry was "it is better to die than to have two identities". This means the Bangsamoro prefer to lose their lives rather than to surrender their identity as Muslim. This battle cry remains in the hearts of the Bangsamoro generation.

However, the Bangsamoro culture and identity that includes arts, sports, music, and others are not much appreciated nor practiced by most of the new generation nowadays due to exposure to foreign cultures, languages, and practices brought about by modern lifestyle and social inclination. They choose to busy themselves with the various social media and its fad than learning their own culture and identity.

**Traditional practices are becoming less popular and less visible.** Thirty years ago, the Bangsamoro traditional practices were common to everyone. On many occasions, the people gathered and feasted on special native delicacies as a gesture of kinship, unity, and solidarity. Indigenous musical instruments were abundant in the Bangsamoro areas. These handcrafted instruments were played during festivals and auspicious occasions. At present, they have become rare and authentic artists are difficult to find. Even worse, majority of the new generation have no knowledge about Bangsamoro history and traditional practices.

Before, the Bangsamoro customary laws of Walay na Bityara in Maguindanaons, Taritib ago Igma of Maranaos, Baitsyara of the people of island provinces and other customs and traditions are observed and effectively used as way of regulating societal affairs. Nowadays, it is very seldom to find someone adept with these customs and traditions.

**Traditional sports, arts, and music slowly forgotten.** With the advent of the modern sports and music coupled with the use of modern gadgets and instruments, the Bangsamoro traditional games, arts, and music are slowly fading and being forgotten. The following are some of the waning Bangsamoro traditional sports and music:

### Table 6.1 Bangsamoro Traditional Sports and Music

| Bangsamoro Traditional Sports | Bangsamoro Traditional Music |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 1. Kakhoya or local version of Marathon (track and field) | 1. Kakholintang, kaagong, kadbak, kapamamundiran, kaphandaopan |
| 2. Kaphaso or local version of horse racing | 2. Kapangotyapi |
| 3. Kazipa sa Manggis for male | 3. Kapangobing |
| 4. Kazipa sa Lama for female | 4. Kapangintsi |
| 5. Kathakian for boys | |
| 6. Kathipho local version of long jump | |
| 7. Kambalintad for girls | |
| 8. Kambiko for girls and boys | |
| 9. Kanggalawanga | |
| 10. Kangalazoga | |
| 11. Kangugorowa | |

**Bangsamoro historical sites are given less importance thereby losing value and significance.** Due to the absence of consolidated and comprehensive Bangsamoro history; the advent of modernization, and the impact of climate change, the value and significance of the Bangsamoro historical sites are gradually disappearing. This is worsened by the absence of relevant regional policies on the preservation and development of historical sites and cultural heritage.

Under Section 26, Article IX of the BOL, the national government shall transfer the management of Bangsamoro historical and cultural sites currently under the jurisdiction of the National Museum of the Philippines, National Historical Commission of the Philippines, and other agencies of the national government to the Bangsamoro Commission for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage (BCPCH). This will be done through intergovernmental relations mechanisms. The BCPCH shall coordinate with relevant agencies of the national government on the regulation, excavation, and preservation of cultural artifacts and on the recovery of lost historical and cultural heritage.

**Tangible and intangible cultural heritages are vanishing.** Bangsamoro identity through visual and other forms of arts will be extinct sooner than our younger generations might realize. There is but limited knowledge on the historical significance of tangible cultural heritage and properties as well as the intangible cultures of the Bangsamoro. In addition to natural disasters, human-induced calamities threaten the destruction and loss of physical entities related to the uniqueness of the Bangsamoro culture. Being susceptible to transport, most of them were sold, transferred, lost, and gradually forgotten.

## Development Opportunities

**Existence of local cultural artists.** Local cultural artists are among the bearers of our cultures through arts. They are the catalysts of the Bangsamoro creative industry which is a growing field in global life. This industry will provide economic growth and decent work for the Bangsamoro cultural artists. In addition, local cultural artists contribute to sustainable tourism that promotes local culture and products. Hence, the remaining existing local cultural artist is a great opportunity in preserving and promoting Bangsamoro culture. They can be utilized as instruments to preserve and develop the cultural arts.

**Presence of cultural arts center.** Cultural centers are spaces for cultural heritage appreciation and artistic growing. It contributes to the efforts to protect and safeguard the Bangsamoro cultural heritage. Moreover, the presence of cultural centers in the region is another opportunity to preserve, develop, and promote culture, and further contribute to sustainable tourism that provides economic opportunities.

**Presence of schools of living tradition (SLT).** In safeguarding intangible cultural heritage, SLT provide a venue to continue the transmission of knowledge to younger generation. It intends to develop traditional cultures such as arts or crafts. It also encourages the culture masters to continue their work in teaching and promoting the cultural heritage and raise more awareness to the community. The presence of SLT in the region provides an opportunity in preserving the Bangsamoro culture.

**Availability of cultural and historical reading material written in local language.** Bangsamoro languages are one of the endangered languages that believed to be lost in the next generation. In order to preserve this culture and its language, it is important to make them available in reading materials. Thus, Bangsamoro languages used in reading materials is an opportunity to transfer the knowledge of the language and culture to the young and the next generations.

## Priority Challenges to be Addressed Within 2023-2028

**Declining appreciation and valuation of Bangsamoro cultural heritage.** It is observed that some of the new generations are gradually losing their appreciation and valuation on culture and heritage. This is partly due to the absence of integrated and comprehensive Bangsamoro history that will help them understand the past and the journey of their forefathers. Another factor is poor promotion initiatives in multimedia, lack of reading materials, and other platforms. Thus, the value and appreciation of the Bangsamoro culture and heritage is declining in the region.

**Undermining Bangsamoro identity.** The Bangsamoro is an ethnolinguistic mosaic made up of at least 13 Islamized, non-Islamized, and indigenous groups. As envisioned in the peace agreements, measures to sustain long-term stability shall ensure the inclusion of the minorities, women, and youth. However, low initiatives and learning spaces to engage them in understanding the Bangsamoro history pose a greater challenge, and this weakens the foundation of cultural heritage and identity. Without a strong foundation, it contributes to low interest and awareness of Bangsamoro history and culture. Considering the important role of the youth in the preservation of culture and identity, there is a need to ensure transfer of knowledge and practices to the younger generation who will continue to preserve the Bangsamoro culture and identity.

**Insufficient resources for comprehensive Bangsamoro historical culture and identity.** Although majority of cultural heritage are informal, unprotected, and not explicitly managed, it plays a significant role in both economic and social life because they are the primary institutions that link people. The cultural backdrop of social existence is defined by history, territory, and society. To date, no institution has concentrated on Bangsamoro history intending to build a library of records, objects, and artifacts. Challenges include insufficient and limited inventory and resources encompassing the history, culture, and identity along with the limited number of Bangsamoro historians and cultural experts as well as limited innovative and creative platform to showcase the Bangsamoro culture and identity.

**Weak policies on cultural and historical preservation and innovation.** Currently, the BARMM is adopting the existing national policies on cultural preservation and development. This needs to be localized to promote the distinct culture of the region. Also, weak policies on cultural preservation and promotion can be attributed to limited coordination among BARMM MOAs, poor functionality of local council for culture and arts, non-mainstreaming of culture and identity to governance, lack of cultural product marketing, innovation, and incentives.
