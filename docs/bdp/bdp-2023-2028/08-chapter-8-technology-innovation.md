# Chapter 8: Harnessing technology and innovations to increase socioeconomic opportunities and improve government services

## Science, Technology, and Innovation

**Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI)** is considered as a key driver in growth and development, specifically in the fields of agriculture, fisheries, and industry. STI is increasingly considered as central to the transition to inclusive, sustainable, and resilient development in both developing and developed countries. In recognition to this, the PDP 2017-2022 made STI the foundation or the 0-10 Point Socioeconomic Agenda of the Duterte Administration with a vision of raising the country towards becoming an innovative and knowledge-driven economy. STI is among the thrusts of the BOL that mandates the Bangsamoro government to strengthen regional programs for science, technology, and innovation. Currently, the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) serves as the lead ministry in promoting, advocating, and developing science and technology-based initiatives.

## Sectoral Assessment

### Weak STI Ecosystem and Governance

There are two (2) higher education institutions (HEIs) in the region that offer science and technology-related courses: the Mindanao State University and the Cotabato Foundation College of Science and Technology. Institutions that would translate the result of research activities into marketable products are lacking within BARMM. There is also no BARMM Science Park, which can serve as the hub of research and technology-based enterprises to transform R&D results into products, processes, and services for commercialization. The institutions that would facilitate connecting business enterprises, start-ups, and venture capitalists in the region are lacking. As of August 2021, there are only 1,340 registered business establishments in the region engaged in manufacturing. This figure only accounts for 0.6 percent of the total registered in the country.

### Weak STI Culture

The low scientific literacy and weak STI culture is one of the greatest challenges in the region. Based on the result of a survey conducted by the Social Weather Station in 2013, the Philippines had only 3.20% scientific literacy compared to Australia (17%) and China (6.5%). The weak STI culture among households leads to the low utilization of new technologies and lack of interest in pursuing science and technology courses.

### Weak Access to Science and Technology Laboratory Facilities

The scientific-based laboratory that could support student learners and researchers with scientific facilities is lacking in the region. Currently, the Bangsamoro Science High School Technology Laboratory (BSHTL), which is a unit under MOST, operates only one science laboratory facility located in Cotabato City. This laboratory is the only service laboratory conducting scientific-based analysis in the region, which primarily performs testing, calibration, and other metrology services and provides technical consultancy services to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME).

### Weak Research and Development (R&D) Support

Despite the presence of research universities in the region, the capability of researchers is weak due to limited budget and research facilities. Based on the NSO data, only 1.10% of the budget in HEIs is allocated for research, and also it only constitutes 0.23% of the region's GRDP in 2019. In the case of SUCs and HEIs, allocations for research, development, and extension are comparatively low. Many local companies are not engaged in R&D activities. The result of R&D activities conducted in the region is not translated into products and services due to the absence of technology business incubators and science parks.

## Opportunities

### The Bangsamoro Autonomous Scholarship for Excellence (BASE) Scholarship

The BASE Scholarship grant offers free higher education to all Bangsamoro people. This is a big opportunity for the graduates of science high schools to take up science and technology courses.

### The Bangsamoro Science High School Technology Laboratory (BSHTL)

There is an ongoing plan of MOST to transform the BSHTL into the BARMM Regional Science High School. Once completed, it will be a big opportunity to increase the number of science and technology course takers from the region.

### The BARMM R&D Agenda and Halal Research Program

The MOST has already developed the Research and Development Agenda for 2020-2025, which serves as the region's policy direction on R&D to address the needs and demands of the industries, communities, and the region in general.

### BARMM Health Research Consortium

The MOH-BARMM, the Mindanao State University (MSU) Marawi and AMAI Pakpak Medical Center (AMPMC), established a health research consortium in the region. Their goal is to establish an appropriate health research system in BARMM and develop the research capability of health workers. This opportunity will support the region in achieving its goal of building sustainable science, technology, and innovation ecosystem.

## Priority Challenges for 2023-2028

1. Low appreciation on the role of science, technology, and innovation in national development
2. Low investment in research and development
3. Weak STI governance
4. Low absorptive capacity of industries
5. Mismatch between training and needs of industry (industry-academia gap)
6. Lack of regulatory science capacity
7. Insufficient collaboration with the private sector
8. Weak intellectual property generation, protection, and commercialization
9. Low human resource capabilities
10. Inadequate and outdated STI infrastructure/facilities

## Strategic Framework

Given the situational assessment, the Strategic Framework (below) illustrates the linkages between the development goal, sub-sector objectives, strategies, programs, and policy agenda for STI. The development goal is to build sustainable science, technology and innovation ecosystem.

The sub-sector objectives are:
1. Strengthen STI ecosystem and governance
2. Improve R&D systems, infrastructure and human resources
3. Enhance access to S&T laboratory facilities and startup support programs
