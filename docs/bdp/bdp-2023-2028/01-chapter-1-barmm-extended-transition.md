# Chapter 1: BARMM and the Extended Transition

This chapter has three parts. The first part discusses the BARMM regional context before and the ongoing transition, the second part narrates the institutional context, and the third part talks about the extended transition and the salient features of the 2nd BDP 2023-2028.

## Regional Context

For decades, the region was in a "conflict trap", characterized by a sustained ebb and flow of violence that was precipitated by a myriad of actors, interests, triggers, and underlying causes. It was and still is in a fragile state. This fragility and the turbulent nature of the political landscape of the region came at a high cost: limited economic growth, a low level of human development, and gaps and disruptions in service delivery.

There were significant events aimed to have a lasting solution to these patterns of violence in the region. Among them include: the signing of the 1996 Final Peace Agreement (FPA) between the Government of the Philippines (GPH) and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) that led to the creation of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM); the signing of the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro (FAB) and the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB) between the GPH and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) under the Benigno Aquino administration; and, the ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) under the Duterte administration that replaced ARMM with BARMM as the new political entity.

The BOL and the installation of a new form of government signaled a new era in governance—Moral Governance. A 12-Point Priority Agenda was laid out with the intent of outlining the priorities within the transition period, which was then supported by the Bangsamoro Development Framework (BDF). This was later translated to a term-based plan called the 1st BDP which articulates moral governance in terms of sectoral outcomes, strategies, and priority programs, projects, and activities (PPAs).

The 1st BDP was an attempt to put in place a sense of predictability in the political and governance landscape of the region during the transition. It served as a development roadmap for the newly installed government and as a basis for annual programming and budgeting. It reflected the transformational results to be achieved within three years and the accompanying strategies, cognizant of the regional and institutional realities. As a regional plan, there was a deliberate effort to align with the PDP 2017-2022 and the 0-10 Socioeconomic Agenda of the Duterte administration.

Despite the significant promise and opportunities of the transition, its starting points were fraught with developmental and institutional challenges. These include: (1) high incidence of poverty; (2) lowest contribution to the national economy; (3) low performance outcomes on health and education; (4) continuing threats to peace, security, public order and safety; (5) insufficient infrastructure facilities; (6) vulnerability to climate change; (7) disruption in service delivery with the gradual phasing out of offices and personnel of the former ARMM; among others.

Based on the assessment of the BARMM performance, there were remarkable changes in the overall regional context. The region has high performance in achieving macroeconomic targets. Five out of six macroeconomic targets set in the 1st BDP were achieved.

### Table 1.1 Macroeconomic Targets set in the 1st BDP 2020-2022

| PERFORMANCE INDICATOR | BASELINE (as reflected in BDP) | END-OF-PLAN TARGET | STATUS | EVIDENCE/MOV |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GRDP Annual Growth Rate | 7.2% (2018) | 7.0% - 7.5% | 7.5% (2021) | Philippine Statistical Authority (PSA) Report |
| Population Growth Rate | 3.78% (2018) | 4.2% | 3.26% (2020) | PSA Report |
| Labor Force Participation Rate | 46.6% (2018) | 46.0% - 50.0% | 60% (2021) | PSA Report |
| Unemployment Rate | 3.7% (2018) | 3.0% | 7.60% (2021) | PSA Report |
| Inflation Rate | 7.09% (2018) | 4.5% - 5.0% | 2.40% (2021) | PSA Report |
| Poverty Incidence (among families) | 52.6% (2018) | 49.6% | 29.80% (2021) | PSA Report |

### Second fastest growing economy in the country

In 2021, BARMM registered 7.5 percent annual economic growth, the second highest growth rate in the country. It was a strong rebound from the -1.9 percent growth in 2020, which was largely caused by the pandemic. This is a strong manifestation that the region is on its way to recovery from the adverse effects of the pandemic.

In addition, BARMM is demonstrating to be moving at the same economic pace with its neighbors. The region registered the highest growth rate in 2017, 2018, 2020, and 2021 in Mindanao. At the time of the pandemic, it registered a decline of -1.9 percent, the lowest among the Mindanao regions.

Even though the BARMM's economic growth is at par with the national average, the regional contribution to national economic output is lowest at 1.4 percent.

### Structural transformation in BARMM's economic landscape

Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing (AFF) used to be the leading sector in BARMM 20 years ago, accounting for more than half of the region's economic output. The industry sector had the lowest contribution, accounting for less than 10 percent of the region's economic output.

A structural change is observed in the past 20 years. By 2021, the services sector replaced AFF as the leading sector, accounting for 36.41 percent of the region's economic output. But a dramatic leap was observed in the industry sector, which grew from 8.13 percent in 2000 to 24.65 percent in 2021 in terms of percentage share. This, however, does not indicate that the AFF has been weakening for the past years. This only indicates that the region is heading towards a balanced economy with the three main sectors moving and contributing significantly to the region's economic output.

### Figure 1.1 GRDP Percent Share, by sector, BARMM, 2000 vs. 2021

**2000:**
- Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing: 55.75%
- Industry: 8.13%
- Services: 36.12%

**2021:**
- Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing: 38.94%
- Industry: 24.65%
- Services: 36.41%

### Historic drop in the incidence of poverty in BARMM

Poverty incidence in the region dropped from 54.20 percent (or 380,000 families) in 2018 to only 29.80 percent (or 230,000 families) in 2021. Despite this historic drop, poverty incidence in the region remains to be the highest in the country.

The massive drop in poverty in the region can be attributed to the double-digit percentage drop in Lanao del Sur, Sulu, Basilan, and Maguindanao. It was only the province of Tawi-Tawi that registered an increase in poverty incidence in the region.

### Figure 1.2 Poverty Incidence by Region, 2018 vs. 2021

| Region | 2018 | 2021 |
|---|---|---|
| BARMM | 54.20% | 29.80% |

### Recovery of tourism and investments from the ill-effects of the pandemic

The pandemic put the tourism sub-sector on a standstill in 2020, causing tourist arrivals to drop to as low as 7,332. But renewed confidence and interest was recorded in 2021 when tourist arrivals grew by more than a thousand-fold, which was 195,822. However, despite the monumental increase in 2021, the number is still far below as compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2018 and 2019.

Investments plummeted from Php4.153 billion in 2019 to only Php14.0 million in 2020 due to the restrictions caused by the pandemic. Though still in the pandemic stage, investments rose to Php2.8 billion in 2021, more than a thousand-fold increase as compared to 2020. Total investments generated from 2019 to 2021 reached Php6.970 billion, which generated 5,020 jobs.

### A gradual shift towards formalization among the MSMEs

In 2021, a total of 8,427 micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) have been registered - a 161.46 percent increase from the number in 2020. It is the highest in a span of five years. Such an increase was a manifestation of the resilience of the Bangsamoro entrepreneurs given the lingering effects of the pandemic.

For two years (2020-2021), BARMM has registered 11,650 businesses through its five provincial offices including Cotabato City, created 31,000 jobs and generated an investment of around Php2.5 billion.

Despite the significant increase in business name registrations (BNR) in 2021, BARMM registered the lowest BNRs in the country, accounting for only 0.92 percent.

### Gains in peace and security

Crime-related incidents, deaths, and displacement dropped to a record low during the transition. However, land conflicts intensified in selected areas in 2020, and rido-related incidents persisted at the time of the pandemic. These, however, did not affect the overall regional stability. Generally, there is relative peace and security in the region during the transition period.

Threats to violent extremism remain endemic in selected localities, and challenges to pernicious shadow economies such as illicit firearms and illegal drug trade remain significant and require immediate attention and action in terms of policy and local support.

### Challenges in education and health outcomes remain impervious

Education performance outcomes in the region are still lowest in the country, and these have been further exacerbated by the pandemic. There was a significant learning loss in 2020 and 2021 as restrictions were imposed to protect the learners. A total of 143 barangays are considered school-less, and thousands of Madrasahs remain unaccredited, implying limited access to government support.

Access to public hospitals, rural health units (RHUs), barangay health stations (BHSs), and medical practitioners remains limited in the region, causing high rates of maternal mortality, infant mortality, and morbidity rates. Nutrition is also a gap, as the region registered the highest malnutrition rate. Access to basic safe water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities is the lowest in the country, explaining the high stunting rate and morbidity rate among children.

### Increasing vulnerability to the effects of climate change

The region is increasingly becoming vulnerable to natural calamities, particularly flooding in low-lying areas, resulting in deaths, displacement, and loss of properties. The typhoon "Paeng" which hit the country on October 28, 2022 caused flooding and landslides, resulting in 61 deaths and homes covered in mud. The casualty in the region was the highest in the country.

## BARMM Institutional Context

### The birth of a new political entity

The passage of RA No. 11054 "An Act Providing for the Organic Law for the BARMM, repealing for the purpose RA No. 6734 as amended by RA No. 9054, entitled 'An Act to Strengthen and Expand the Organic Act for the ARMM,'" paved the way for the establishment of a new political entity. On July 27, 2018, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte signed it into law, and was ratified through a plebiscite in early 2019. The ratification of RA No. 11054, also known as the BOL, commenced the transition of the defunct ARMM into the BARMM, a new autonomous regional government.

### A shift in the system of governance

The birth of this new political entity was confronted with various challenges, specifically with changes in government structure and political leadership. A unitary system of governance was adopted by the ARMM government. However, with the change of political entity through the ratification of the BOL, the Bangsamoro government is currently adopting a parliamentary system of governance in running the BARMM. Indeed, birthing pains in establishing this new political entity are being endured by the Bangsamoro government, which started with the shifting of the system of governance during the transition of the ARMM to BARMM.

### Transitioning from ARMM to BARMM, the appointment of interim officers, and the execution of powers

As stated in Article XVI, Section 1 of RA No. 11054, the transition period for the establishment of the BARMM commenced upon the ratification of the BOL. BARMM seeks to foster genuine autonomy, moral governance, and improve fiscal management in the region. However, the transition from ARMM to BARMM is a very significant change that brings enormous challenges to the Bangsamoro government.

Following the ratification of the BOL was the creation of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) as the interim government in the BARMM, holding both legislative and executive powers during the transition period.

President Rodrigo R. Duterte appointed Ahod B. Ebrahim as the interim Chief Minister of the Bangsamoro government, bearing the executive power and authority over the region, while Atty. Pangalian M. Balindong was appointed as the BTA Parliament Speaker along with the other members of the Parliament holding the legislative power and authority in the BARMM.

Thereafter, Chief Minister Ahod B. Ebrahim submitted to the BTA Parliament a transition plan last June 17, 2019, that served as the initial basis and guide for the organizational plan, schedule of phasing out of employees, and other transition mechanisms of the six priority codes. The proposed transition plan was voted on by the majority of the Members of Parliament, and thus, approved by the BTA Parliament. With its approval, the Bangsamoro government began organizing the interim Cabinet, but the implementation of the transition plan affected the usual government operations, which hampered the delivery of services across the region. On the other hand, the transition period shall end upon the dissolution of the BTA as provided in the BOL.

### Phasing out of ARMM offices, separation of ARMM personnel, and transfer of powers and properties

The commencement of the transition signaled a full transfer of powers, functions, and properties of the ARMM government to the BARMM government, except for those properties, land, and structures located outside the ARMM. All ARMM offices were deemed abolished upon ratification of the BOL, resulting in the reorganization of the bureaucracy. The Bangsamoro government was able to implement the gradual phasing out of employees. However, this also caused a minimal disruption in the continuity of government services.

Further, the disposition and separation from government service also brought confusion to the majority of ARMM personnel. Nevertheless, the Bangsamoro government executed Section 10, Article XVI of RA No. 11054 which states that "All affected personnel who will not be absorbed in the positions of the new staffing pattern of the different offices in the Bangsamoro government, whether hired on a permanent, temporary, casual, or contractual basis and with appointments attested by the Civil Service Commission (CSC), shall be entitled to applicable retirement or separation benefits as provided in this Organic Law." Therefore, retired and separated ARMM personnel were given due compensation for the services they had rendered to the government.

In consideration of the public interest and continuity in the delivery of services, ARMM officials holding appointive positions were retained to continue performing their functions in accordance with the phase-out schedule. Despite retaining those officials, most of the offices faced difficulties especially with the technical and field operations because many employees from the defunct ARMM were not retained nor absorbed by their office.

Meanwhile, the employees coming from the sectors of health, education, and social welfare have been absorbed and transferred to the Bangsamoro government.

### Organization of bureaucracy—merging, restructuring, and creation of new offices in the BARMM

Even being guided by the transition plan, the merging and restructuring of offices connotes major changes in operations and services. The mandates of the offices being merged and restructured became bigger, yet the number of employees did not equate to the number of jobs to be done to effectively implement the mandate of the merged offices.

Among the merged and restructured offices are the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education (MBHTE), Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Agrarian Reform (MAFAR), Ministry of Trade, Investments, and Tourism (MTIT), Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources, and Energy (MENRE), and Ministry of Finance and Budget and Management (MFBM).

### Hiring of new BARMM personnel

With the organization of the new bureaucracy, the BTA has established an independent, strictly merit-based and credible placement and hiring process in all BARMM MOAs. The Bangsamoro Job Portal—an online platform where all applicants have equal opportunity to apply for any vacant positions in different ministries, offices, and agencies of the Bangsamoro government—was established.

As of December 2022, the Bangsamoro government received more than 600,000 job applications for around 7,725 positions posted on the Bangsamoro Job Portal. Aside from the plantilla posted in the job portal, there are thousands of job orders and contracts of services in different MOAs that are not posted in the said portal. This high volume of hopefuls vying for a position in the BARMM was overwhelming as it reflected their desire to be part of the Bangsamoro government.

Given this figure, the Bangsamoro government was receiving a backlash from the public, particularly from the applicants who were inquisitive about the hiring process. Currently, most of the vacant and available positions posted in the portal were already filled up.

### Inclusion of Cotabato City and SGA to the BARMM

Following the passage and ratification of the BOL, Cotabato City and SGA formed part of the Bangsamoro territory after they favorably voted for inclusion in the BARMM during the plebiscite.

The Bangsamoro government faced challenges in the inclusion of these areas in the regional planning and budgeting processes due to delays in the formal turnover of these areas to BARMM and perceived resistance of the City Government of Cotabato pending the decision for the protest they filed before the Supreme Court.

However, the Bangsamoro government was able to surpass these concerns through the issuance of an Executive Order (EO) issued by the Chief Minister on January 20, 2020, creating the Development Coordinating Office (DCO) tasked to administer the planning and implementation of PPAs of the MOAs in the SGA.

Further, Cotabato City officially became part of the BARMM on December 15, 2020 after a formal turnover of the supervision of Cotabato City to BARMM by the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Central Office.

## The BARMM extended transition

President Duterte signed on October 28, 2021 the law extending the transition period of BARMM from 2022 to 2025, thereby postponing the first regional parliamentary elections in the region. RA No. 11593 stipulates that the first parliamentary elections shall be held and synchronized with the 2025 national elections. It also stipulates that the BTA shall continue as the interim government during the extension of the transition period and the President may appoint the 80 new members of the BTA, who shall serve up to June 30, 2025 or until their successors shall have been elected. The BTA will continue to be MILF-led.

## The 2nd BDP 2023-2028

### Legal Basis

As the 1st BDP is now in its final term, the Office of the Chief Minister issued Memorandum Order No. 0092, directing all heads of ministries, offices, and agencies for the formulation of the 2nd BDP, Results Matrices (RM), and the Bangsamoro Development and Investment Program (BDIP) for 2023-2028. The 2nd BDP is envisioned to sustain the gains and pursue the development direction, priorities, and strategies outlined in the 1st BDP.

The formulation of the 2nd BDP commenced with the conduct of a rigorous review and assessment of the 12-Point Priority Agenda and the 1st BDP 2020-2022. The assessment findings and recommendations served as guideposts in the design of the 2nd BDP process.

### Approach

A whole-sector approach was adopted in the planning process. The five BEDC sectoral committees and special committee were the mechanisms tapped in the four phases of the planning process. The BPDA as the technical secretariat of the BEDC was instrumental in ensuring that the sectoral and special committees were mobilized in crafting the strategic directions of their respective sectors and assigned chapters.

### Cross-cutting themes

While moral governance is the overarching guiding principle, this is being operationalized in the 2nd BDP in terms of inclusion, equity, and justice. These three elements served as the cross-cutting themes and, to some extent, the guiding principles in crafting the strategic directions of the five sectors of the 2nd BDP.

### Planning Standards and Principles

**Building on the gains.** There was a recognition that key results, particularly outcomes, and the corresponding strategies in the 1st BDP are still relevant and significant for adoption in the 2nd BDP 2023-2028.

**BOL as the policy anchor.** The stipulations in the BOL served as the policy framework of the strategic directions in each of the sectors. As the framework, it provides the coverage or the limits in terms of rights, powers, and authority to exercise and the mechanisms and systems to create.

**Moral governance as the guidepost.** Moral governance continues to be the guidepost in terms of leadership and overall service delivery, but this will be operationalized through its cross-cutting themes of inclusion, equity, and justice for the next six years.

**Vertical and horizontal alignment.** There was a deliberate effort to ensure that the 2nd BDP was vertically aligned to the SDG, 8-point Socioeconomic Agenda of the Marcos administration, PDP 2023-2028, and the Mindanao Development Agenda. Coordination meetings were conducted with NEDA Central Office and NEDA Regional Office (NRO) XII. Close coordination was also conducted with MinDA to ensure alignment with the Mindanao Development Agenda. The Bangsamoro Spatial Strategy was a byproduct of such close coordination.

In terms of horizontal alignment, it was ensured that the 2nd BDP was able to translate the priorities set in the enhanced 12-Point Priority Agenda into specific strategies and initiatives. In addition, the ranked priority list of projects reflected in the BDIP was based on the list in the 2nd BDP. The annual priorities in the BDIP will be the basis for the Annual Investment Program (AIP), which will serve as the basis for the General Appropriations Act for the Bangsamoro (GAAB).

Coordination was conducted with several ministries for the sectoral plans such as the Gender and Development (GAD) plan, Disaster Risk Reduction and Management - Climate Change Adaptation (DRRM-CCA) plan, Camps Transformation Plan (CTP), Bangsamoro Food Security and Nutrition (BFSN) plan, among others, to ensure its alignment in terms of results, strategies, and priority programs and projects.

**Evidence-based.** Data from the different agencies with the mandate to produce official estimates were used in formulating the sectoral profile and trends. Majority of the data were taken from the PSA and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). Data systems of agencies such as the Enhanced Basic Education Information System (EBEIS) of the MBHTE and the Field Health Services Information System (FHSIS) of the Ministry of Health (MOH) were key sources of data.

Various literatures were also used to ensure that claims are supported with research or scientific inquiry.

**Strategic or critical thinking.** One of the biggest investments of this planning process was strategy formulation because strategies are the direct link between results and initiatives. Several consultations and workshops were conducted to ensure that the strategies formulated were not only effective in addressing the "wicked" problems but also have multiplier or cascading effects. Strategies are the link between the desired result and the interventions. There will be no program that will be implemented that is not anchored to a strategy. The sectoral committees referred to the clusters in the objective tree and formulated a strategy. Each strategy should be able to address multiple critical issues in the problem tree.

**Inclusive and participatory.** Consultations with the provincial, municipal, city, and barangay LGUs, CSOs, academe, private sectors, and other stakeholders were also conducted for an inclusive and participatory planning. The five sectors were meaningfully engaged in problem analysis, target setting and strategy formulation, investment programming, and results-based monitoring and evaluation.

### Strategic shifts from the 1st BDP

**Setting targets.** A shift from point estimate to a range of values was undertaken in setting targets to accommodate internal and external shocks that are oftentimes beyond government or state control. In addition, annual average growth rates as opposed to annual growth rate were used because the sustained or long-term performance is more critical as opposed to a one-time or annual performance. Further, measures of inequality and severity have been added as indicators of performance.

**Defining accountabilities.** The notion of "objectives" is being introduced in the 2nd BDP. This is to make the distinction which accountabilities are at the sectoral level, the sub-sector level, and at the institutional level.

**Emphasis on strategy.** Strategy is treated as the unifying element as this is the direct link between targeted results and the initiatives. This implies that no program or project will be proposed and implemented that is not anchored to a development strategy. The strategies have been instrumental in promoting vertical and horizontal alignment. This also implies that regional strategies have to be at some points supporting international and national strategies. Likewise provincial, city, and municipal strategies have to be supporting regional strategies. Contextualization can be done in terms of programs and projects, but alignment at the strategy level must be pursued.

### Process

**Assessment of 12-Point Priority Agenda and the 1st BDP.** In anticipation to update the 12-Point Priority Agenda and the formulation of a successor plan of the 1st BDP, the BEDC sectoral committees started a series of assessment activities in January 2022.

**Issuance of memorandum.** Memorandum Circular No. 0092 was issued on May 16, 2022, directs the BEDC through its five sectoral committees to spearhead the 2nd BDP formulation process with assistance from the BPDA being the technical secretariat. The said memorandum also mandates the BEDC sectoral committees to initiate and draft the BDIP and the RM as accompanying documents.

**Situational analysis and problem analysis.** Several studies and assessment reports were used in formulating the sectoral profile and trends. The five BEDC sectoral committees underwent problem analysis using the Strength-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) analysis, Political-Economic-Sociological-Technological-Legal-Environmental (PESTLE), and the Problem Tree analysis as tools.

**Target setting and strategy formulation.** The five BEDC sectoral committees formulated the sectoral goals and objectives based on the Objective Tree analysis. The sectoral goal and objectives reflect the transformational results to be achieved by the end of 2028. This is supported by Indicator-Baseline-Target Matrix.

The biggest investment was strategy formulation because not only the strategies should be distinct from activities, but they should be able to demonstrate a cascading or broad-based effect. Strategies are the link between the desired result and the interventions. There will be no program that will be implemented that is not anchored to a strategy. The sectoral committees referred to the clusters in the objective tree and formulated a strategy. Each strategy should be able to address multiple critical issues in the problem tree.

**Investment programming.** The five BEDC sectoral committees underwent a rigorous prioritization process of projects using the Conflict-Compatibility-Complementarity Matrix, Urgency Test, and the Goal Achievement Matrix (GAM). The output was a ranked list of priority projects with individual and cumulative cost estimates. Stream 2 of investment programming was determining the investible funds and stream 3 delved into matching the fund requirements with projected funds available and deciding on financing options should the funds available are insufficient.

**Results-based monitoring and evaluation.** A Results Matrix (RM) was formulated that covers the full hierarchy of results with baseline, targets, and means of verification. The RM is being supported with a Performance Measurement System (PMS) to reflect the institutional accountabilities and arrangements.

**LGU consultations and validation.** Strategic directions reflected in the draft 2nd BDP were presented during the LGU consultations and validation workshops. These were participated by representatives of six provincial governments, three city governments, 75 municipal governments, 142 barangay governments, 49 CSOs, three academic institutions, five private sector organizations, and BARMM MOAs.

### Accompanying Documents

The 2nd BDP has three accompanying documents. These are:

**Bangsamoro Development Investment Program (BDIP).** The BDIP contains the list of priority programs and projects, financing options, and the development approach to be undertaken.

**Results Matrices (RM).** The RM presents the hierarchy of results with indicators and means of verification. It delineates levels of accountabilities at the sectoral level, sub-sector level, and at the institutional level.

**Bangsamoro Development Policy and Research Agenda (BDPRA).** The BDPRA contains a detailed accounting of policy research requirements that have to be pursued within the term of the 2nd BDP. It guides how the enabling environment can be further enhanced to push the reforms forward.
