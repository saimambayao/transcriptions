**A Quick Guide to Assessing Performance, Potential and Readiness**

**Why Assess?**
Your success as a supervisor depends on your ability to provide feedback and coaching in ways that support current performance, develop potential, and ensure that people are ready for the roles and assignments you give them. Your approach will be different, depending on where the employee is on the Performance-Potential-Readiness grid.

**Steps to Assess**
1. Performance (Low to High)
2. Potential (Low to High)
3. Readiness (Low to High)

**What is it?**
*   **Performance:** Effectiveness in achieving the goals and meeting the expectations of the CURRENT role. Includes results and behaviors, or the “what” and the “how”
*   **Potential:** Capacity to eventually develop the skills needed for a larger role
*   **Readiness:** The degree to which an individual has already successfully acquired the skills, knowledge, and abilities required for the NEW role/project

**When to assess?**
*   **Performance:** Individuals in their CURRENT role.
*   **Potential:** If meets/exceeds CURRENT role expectations; Has capacity to develop skills needed for more complex projects and assignments.
*   **Readiness:** Meets FUTURE role expectations: Is ready and has skills needed to work on complex projects, and assignments; New hire.

**What does it look like?**
*   **Performance:** 
    *   Delivers RESULTS: meets expectations in WHAT they accomplish.
    *   Demonstrates BEHAVIORS: meets expectations in HOW they get results.
*   **Potential:** 
    *   Ability to SOLVE COMPLEX PROBLEMS.
    *   PERSISTS when faced with mistakes, setbacks, and roadblocks.
    *   Driven and MOTIVATED to take on challenging work.
    *   Improves based on FEEDBACK.
*   **Readiness:** 
    *   INTEREST in taking on responsibility for more complex work.
    *   SKILLS, KNOWLEDGE, and ABILITIES to meet future role expectations in BOTH results and behaviors.

---

**Assessing Performance, Potential and Readiness (Cont.)**

**Next Steps**
Once you assess an individual’s Performance, Potential and Readiness, use these guidelines to make your feedback and coaching more effective. Note that Readiness is generally assessed when there is an opportunity for a role at the next level, for example, when hiring someone or giving out a new assignment or project.

**Low Performing Low Potential**
Focus your feedback and coaching on CHANGING THEIR RESULTS AND/OR BEHAVIORS. Take a closer look at what aspect of performance suffers the most:
*   Results (the “what“; e.g., quality of work, missed deadlines)
*   Behaviors (the “how“; e.g., negativism, failure to follow instructions, unwillingness to take responsibility)
It’s very likely that this employee is not open to feedback, however, that does not mean you should hold off having a conversation. Emphasize that meeting performance expectations is ultimately their responsibility and they need to own it. Revisit the goals and expectations, check for understanding and agree on the follow-up plan.

**Low Performing High Potential**
Focus your feedback and coaching on CHANGING THEIR RESULTS AND/OR BEHAVIORS. Take a closer look at which aspect of performance suffers the most:
*   Results (the “what“; e.g., quality of work, missed deadlines)
*   Behaviors (the “how“; e.g., negativism, failure to follow instructions, unwillingness to take responsibility)
Clarify/set specific performance goals and expectations, and ask for their input. Help them understand how their behavior impacts both work and others around them. Agree on the follow-up plan and establish periodic check points.

**High Performing Low Potential**
Focus your feedback and coaching on DEVELOPING THEIR POTENTIAL. Ask them about their interests, goals and aspirations, assess the development opportunities that will help them stay engaged. Find out whether they are aware of how others perceive them and how they come across. Show them how their role impacts your department/unit work.

**High Performing High Potential**
Focus your feedback and coaching on SUSTAINING, REINFORCING AND RECOGNIZING PERFORMANCE as well as helping them become a coach, mentor, and/or role model for others to learn from. Consider whether larger, more complex projects, assignments, or roles might be appropriate, if so, assess the skills needed to be effective at this work.

**A Quick Guide to Feedback**
**Get Ready, Get Set, Give Feedback!**

**What is feedback?**
Feedback is information communicated for the purpose of helping another person modify their behavior to improve learning and performance.

**Why should I give feedback?**
Feedback is how supervisors let people know where they stand with respect to performance expectations and is an important part of coaching people in their development. All supervisors are expected to provide effective, regular feedback.

**How do you give effective feedback?**
Simply follow the “Get Ready, Get Set, Give Feedback” framework outlined below.

**Lay the groundwork for successful feedback**
**Get Ready**
*   **Be aware of your biases**
    *   What are the possible explanations for a person’s behavior?
    *   What is the information that contradicts your perceptions?
*   **Face your fear of delivering feedback**
    *   What are the likely consequences to the individual and their colleagues if you do not deliver difficult feedback?
    *   How might you handle things if the feedback conversation gets challenging?
*   **Motivate the person through connecting with their goals**
    *   How can your feedback help them achieve their goals?
    *   If they don’t take your feedback seriously, how might this hinder their effectiveness?
*   **Build trust and create an emotionally safe environment**
    *   How will you frame your feedback as an opportunity for learning and growth?
    *   What questions will you ask to demonstrate that you value their perspective?

**Reflection Question.** What do you want to START/CONTINUE /STOP doing with regard to feedback?

---

**Get Ready, Get Set, Give Feedback! (Cont.)**

**Stop and consider whether feedback will be effective**
**Get Set**
*   **Situation:** Will there be opportunities for the person to practice the behavior again?
    *   **Is it good time to give feedback?:** If not, ask yourself how you might provide them with the opportunity to practice.
*   **Situation:** Does the person have the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to perform the desired behavior?
    *   **Is it good time to give feedback?:** If not, consider how to coach the person to close these gaps in knowledge, skills, and abilities.
*   **Situation:** Has the person had the chance to familiarize themselves with the task?
    *   **Is it good time to give feedback?:** If not, feedback will interfere with learning. Provide feedback once they are familiar with the task.
*   **Situation:** Is the person in the middle of the task?
    *   **Is it good time to give feedback?:** If yes, feedback will simply cause an unwelcome interruption and a distraction. Wait until the task is complete to provide feedback.

**You’ve planned the feedback and considered the timing, now Go!**
**Give Feedback**
*   Be specific about behaviors and explain why a behavior was effective or ineffective, and help the person understand the situation, their behavior, and the impact of their behavior.
    *   Example: “Mai, when we were in our meeting earlier today, you kept looking out the window and I felt like you weren’t paying attention to what I was saying.”
*   Does the person understand what you are trying to convey?
*   Connect the feedback to specific goals.
*   Focus on the present task.

Once feedback is given, concentrate on coaching, which will help the person apply the feedback they have received.

**Reflection Question.** What are some things you might try to do differently when it comes to feedback?

---

**A Quick Guide to Coaching**

**What is coaching?**
Coaching is “the process of equipping people with the tools, knowledge, and opportunities they need to develop themselves and become more effective” (David Peterson, PhD, Psychology, University of Minnesota).

**Successful coaching includes:**
*   self-awareness,
*   motivation,
*   ongoing feedback and support,
*   application, and
*   accountability.

**COACHING PROCESS**
[Diagram: Self Awareness -> Motivation -> Ongoing Feedback & Support (Cycle: New Skill Development, Practice Opportunities, Assessment, Reflection) -> Application -> Accountability]

**Why should I be a coach?**
*   Coaching helps people reach a high level of performance, realize their potential, and stay engaged in important work.
*   Coaching helps retain motivated, talented and skilled people.

**How do I get started?**
The following steps will help you coach more effectively:

---

**Coaching (Cont.)**

**1. Self-Awareness**
Does the person have the self-awareness to learn from the coaching?
**What does success look like?**
The person can identify and accurately describe the following without getting defensive:
*   their skills, knowledge, and abilities,
*   their areas of weakness and what they are not good at,
*   how other people perceive them, including strengths and weaknesses.

**Sample questions to ask when coaching**
*   What are your greatest professional strengths?
*   What do you consider to be your areas of opportunity?
*   How would others describe you?

**Building Self-Awareness**
*   Help the individual assess their areas of strengths and opportunities by having a conversation, sharing your observations, and encouraging the person to get feedback from peers.
*   If self-awareness is not present, then the focus of feedback and coaching needs to be on helping the person build it.

**2. Motivation**
Does the person have the motivation to learn from the coaching?
**What does success look like?**
*   The person demonstrates that they are willing to work hard and put in the effort required to improve their skills and performance.
*   The person is persistent and does not give up when they make a mistake, fail, or run into problems.

**Sample questions to ask when coaching**
*   How motivated are you to make a change?
*   How will you benefit from making this change?
*   How much time and energy are you willing to invest to improve your skills?

**Building motivation**
*   Help them understand what is in it for them if they invest the time and energy to improve.
*   Help connect development to the person’s goals, broader vision and mission.
*   Support their confidence by providing feedback, advice, and encouragement.

---

**Coaching (Cont.)**

**3. Ongoing Feedback and Support**
What can you do on an ongoing basis to support the development of the skills, knowledge, and abilities the person needs to be successful? What are the best tools to help facilitate their development?
*   One of the biggest coaching decisions is deciding exactly what skills, knowledge, and abilities to focus on and picking appropriate tools to help the person develop.

**What does success look like?**
*   The person seeks out and receives regular feedback and encouragement to help them develop specific skills.
*   The person asks for and is provided with opportunities to learn and practice the skills they need to develop.
*   Regular assessment of progress and performance and opportunities to reflect on growth and learning.

**Sample questions to ask when coaching**
*   What training/development would help you better perform your work? Specific training, formal or informal? Mentoring? Observing others? Learning from a colleague?
*   How will the training benefit your work?

**Effective tools for providing feedback and support**
*   **NEW SKILL TRAINING:** Teach employees new skills or help them perfect existing skills. Provide them with specific skill training and establish accountability for them to use the new skill. Be intentional and creative about connecting the individual with resources and specific skill training.
*   **PROVIDING PRACTICE OPPORTUNITIES:** Help employees acquire new skills or grow existing skills by providing opportunities through role-playing, rehearsing, or trying out new skills or behaviors.
*   **ASSESSMENT:** Formally or informally assess the person’s performance (both results and behaviors) to identify opportunities for development or performance in the context of coaching goals.
*   **PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFLECTION:** Encourage the person to reflect on performance, both in terms of results and behaviors, journal, and/or provide relevant reading assignments.

---

**Coaching (Cont.)**

**4. Application**
Provide opportunities to apply and master skills on the job.
**What does success look like?**
*   The person is using the knowledge and skills acquired in training to become more effective at work and is educating others about ways to become more efficient
*   The person asks questions about the ways new skills/knowledge can be applied in day-to-day work.
*   The person seeks opportunities to apply and/or applies the newly acquired skills.

**Sample questions to ask when coaching**
*   How can I help you apply the learning on the job?
*   What special projects or assignments will allow you to practice?

**Providing Application Opportunities**
*   Identify projects or work assignments that will allow the person to apply the skills they are learning. Consider low-stakes assignments to start with.
*   Be available to assist the person if they get stuck or need additional support.
*   Provide room for making mistakes as they learn and apply new skills.
*   Encourage taking on challenging work.
*   Help the person reflect on what they are learning, and where they might be stuck and need additional support.

**5. Accountability**
Recognize improvement, reward success, and foster accountability.
**What does success look like?**
*   The person initiates discussions on goals and progress.
*   The person receives recognition for improvement and is rewarded for success.
*   The person seeks out and is provided with constructive feedback.

**Sample questions to ask when coaching**
*   What progress do you think you have made on your coaching goals?
*   What do you need from me to further your development?
*   What incentives are meaningful to you?
*   What leadership opportunities would you be interested in?

**Promoting Accountability**
*   Provide regular feedback, advice, and encouragement.
*   Help establish individual development plans.
*   Establish regular check-in sessions (both formal and informal) to follow up on goals and progress made.

**A Quick Guide to Goal Setting**

**What are goals?**
Goals are the most important way to set expectations for an employee that include both key RESULTS of what needs to be accomplished and BEHAVIORS, or how the results are accomplished over the next year.
Note: depending on the work, some goals can span several years or have a shorter time-span. Use your judgement to set the goals that do not fit an annual time frame.

**Why should I set goals?**
[Graphic: Effective Performance Management Timeline - Goals -> Check-Ins -> Formal Evaluation]
Setting annual goals is the first step in effective performance management.
*   Well-designed goals guide an employee’s priorities and efforts over the course of the year.
*   Setting meaningful goals is one of the most powerful ways that you can motivate employees, focus their efforts, and help them improve their performance.
*   Clear and relevant goals are the foundation for effective coaching and feedback as well as for performance evaluations.

**How do I set goals?**
Simply follow the steps which outline the best practices below.

**01 ASK FOR INPUT**
Ask the person for their thoughts and suggestions on their goals. Goal-setting is a two-way street and employees will be more likely to find the goals meaningful and motivating if this is a collaborative exercise.

**02 IDENTIFY THE 3-5 MOST IMPORTANT EXPECTATIONS**
Identify three to five expectations that are most important for the employee over the next year. Include expectations for both results and behaviors (the “what” and the “how“).
*   Describe the most important results this person needs to achieve. Example:
    *   **Result:** Complete the student services process improvement project by the end of October.
    *   **Result:** Determine two viable options for replacing the current data analysis tool and evaluate the pros and cons of each by the end of February.
*   Describe how this person needs to achieve these results. In other words, identify and describe the behavioral competencies* (i.e (Continued from Page 9)

**Behavior:** Effectively looks beyond the surface to identify underlying issues and root-causes of problems.
**Behavior:** Is able to proactively keep others informed of important updates, information, and issues.

Do not have a behavioral competency model? Go to z.umn.edu/competencies to learn more about the competency model developed at the University of Minnesota to support talent development discussions.

---

**A Quick Guide to Goal Setting (Cont.)**

**03 CONNECT TO BROADER PRIORITIES**
Describe how these three to five goals will contribute to the broader priorities and goals of the department, college, or unit. Discuss these connections with the employee. Example:
**Impact:** If successful, the student services process improvement project will not only save the college money, but it will also remove a big source of frustration for students.
**Impact:** Finding a good replacement for our data analysis tool will allow us to analyze data much faster, so our lab will be more productive and better able to take on larger projects.

**04 BE SURE THE GOALS ARE CHALLENGING, SO THAT SUCCESS IS MEANINGFUL**
Goals should be challenging enough that they push employees outside of their comfort zones, but are achievable with significant effort.
You can do this by defining what success looks like for each goal. Goals that are not challenging enough will not support growth and a high level of performance.
Ask yourself if achieving a particular goal would be a meaningful and significant accomplishment. If not, consider making the goal more challenging. Example:

**Not challenging enough:** Complete the process improvement project.
**Challenging:** The process improvement project will be successful if everyone understands the benefits of the new process and feels their concerns are addressed, if students experience an improvement in the process, and if everyone adheres to the new process.

**Not challenging enough:** Find a replacement for our current data analysis tool.
**Challenging:** A replacement for our data analysis tool will be successful if it provides the specific capabilities each graduate student and faculty member need for their specific project, if the cost is within the budget, if it is implemented before next September, and if everyone is adequately trained in how to use it.

**05 CHECK-IN TO REVIEW PROGRESS, UPDATE GOALS, AND SET MORE SPECIFIC, SHORTER-TERM GOALS**
Have ongoing check-ins* on a regular basis to discuss progress toward the broad annual goals, to update and revise them, and to create more specific, shorter-term goals. Avoid the “set-and-forget” trap of writing goals and not looking at them again until review time. Even if annual goals are not set, it’s never too late to set goals as they should be ongoing and flexible.
* Be specific and detailed in setting goals, but avoid spending more effort than it’s worth.
* SMART goals (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound) are a common practice in many organizations and can take a lot of time and energy to create. However, for many roles, changes in the work over the course of a year will render SMART goals obsolete.
* Instead, once you have set annual goals, use ongoing check-ins to update and revise goals as well as to create more specific, shorter-term flexible goals.

* See the Quick Guide to Ongoing Check-Ins for structure and best practices on conducting ongoing check-in discussions.

**Next Step:**
Hold regular check-ins throughout the year to review progress on these goals, update them as needed, and set more specific, shorter-term goals.

---

**A Quick Guide to Ongoing Check-Ins**

**What are check-ins?**
Check-ins are regular discussions that happen throughout the year to:
* Check in on progress toward goals,
* Stay aligned on current projects,
* Discuss what is going well and what could be better, and
* Agree on next steps.

Ongoing check-ins are the key to on-the-job learning, which is the single most important way people improve and grow at work. Effective performance management requires regular check-ins as work progresses.

**How do I conduct ongoing check-ins?**
The ideal frequency of check-in discussions depends upon the work, the person, and any local practices or expectations for supervisors. For most roles, be sure to discuss the following during each check-in at least once per month. Use your judgment regarding what will best support the performance and development of each person you supervise.

**01 DISCUSS ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR CHECK-INS**
Discuss expectations for what you, the supervisor, and your direct report are each responsible for. If one or both of you are not taking ownership for your role in check-ins, this is an important place to start your next check-in conversation.

**Your role as a supervisor**
* Communicate vision and strategy
* Clarify the employee’s role in the big picture
* Provide clear expectations for results and behaviors
* Define what success looks like
* Bring goals and expectations into regular feedback and coaching conversations

**Your direct report’s role**
* Ask questions
* Be proactive when work seems misaligned with broader goals
* Seek, accept, and act on feedback
* Take ownership for their own career and development - set goals, seek opportunities, ask for guidance when needed

Be clear with the employee about their role in check-ins. If the person is not doing their part, address this directly, otherwise your efforts will be wasted. A common trap for supervisors is to take on responsibility for the employee’s role.

**02 REVIEW ANNUAL GOALS; FOR NEW PROJECTS OR ASSIGNMENTS, DISCUSS EXPECTATIONS**
Briefly review the annual goals and discuss how individual projects and assignments fit into the bigger picture. When people understand how their efforts contribute to serve a bigger purpose, they will be more motivated and engaged in their work.
Ongoing flexible goal setting* will keep their day-to-day work connected to the broader priorities and goals of the department, college, or unit.

* See the Quick Guide to Goal Setting for steps and best practices on setting up goals.

---

**Ongoing Check-Ins (Cont.)**

**02 REVIEW ANNUAL GOALS; FOR NEW PROJECTS OR ASSIGNMENTS, DISCUSS EXPECTATIONS (CONT.)**
**Flexible Goal Setting for New Projects or Assignments**
Discuss the following questions:
* How does this project or assignment fit into the employee’s annual goals? If it does not, discuss why it makes sense for this person to take on this project or assignment.
* What does success look like with regard to the goals?
* What behavioral competencies* will be most important for success?
Take a note of this information as reference for future check-ins, especially since it will help inform the formal evaluation at the end of the year.

* Need more information on behavioral competencies? Go to z.umn.edu/competencies to learn more about the competency model developed at the University of Minnesota to support talent development discussions.

**03 EVALUATE CURRENT PROGRESS AND PROVIDE COACHING TO SUPPORT PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT**
Discuss and evaluate progress toward goals; this does not need to be a formal assessment. Consider the person’s level of performance, potential, and readiness, if applicable - this will help you focus your feedback and coaching where it is needed**.
**Provide feedback and coaching:**
* Consider the person’s level of SELF-AWARENESS and MOTIVATION to learn from feedback and coaching. If they are not self-aware or motivated, address this first.
* Consider whether feedback will be effective at this point in time. If yes, give feedback to help the person understand the SITUATION, their BEHAVIOR, and the IMPACT of their behavior. Be sure to take every opportunity to provide positive feedback and recognize good work, it is a powerful way to reinforce effective behaviors and to motivate higher performance.
* Consider whether NEW SKILL TRAINING would be helpful.
* Provide opportunity for REFLECTION - what is going well? What can be done better?
* Discuss OPPORTUNITIES for the person TO APPLY AND MASTER THE SKILLS through the project and assignments they are working on.

** Need more information about feedback and coaching? Or assessing performance, potential and readiness? Go to z.umn.edu/SDCmodule1 for quick guides, videos and more.

**04 DETERMINE NEXT STEPS**
Discuss and agree on next steps for the work, for the person’s development, and for your future check-ins:
* What are the person’s next steps and when will these next steps be taken?
* What are your next steps as their supervisor and when will you take them?
This can be a simple conversation or a more detailed, formal process. Consider what makes the most sense for the work, for the individual, and what practices and expectations exist within your college, campus, or unit.

**A Quick Guide to Performance Evaluation**

**What is performance evaluation?**
Performance evaluation includes measuring effectiveness in meeting expectations for achieving results as well as how those results are achieved (i.e., behaviors).
Effective performance evaluation does not happen only at the end of a year but through ongoing check-ins throughout the year.
Formal evaluation is the final step in the performance management process and includes writing and delivering a performance evaluation.
Ideally, a formal evaluation is a summary of what has already been discussed throughout the year.

**How do I conduct performance evaluation?**

**Before you begin**
**Rater Bias:** Everyone has biases, and we bring them to the table when evaluating ourselves or others. Be consciously mindful when undertaking performance evaluation. Setting up an effective performance management system that includes the best practices will help alleviate potential bias in a formal performance evaluation.
**Local Process:** Performance evaluation processes and methods are determined locally. Your college, campus, or unit may have their own guidelines for performance management, including the timing, steps, and the forms and tools you need to use. Contact your local HR team to learn about the specific guidelines.

**Follow the steps that outline the best practices below:**

**01 GET EMPLOYEE INPUT ON THEIR RESULTS AND IMPACT**
Have employees summarize their key results and accomplishments for the year (e.g., shared Google doc or MS Word). These descriptions should include: a) the situations they faced, b) the actions they took and the results they achieved, and c) the impact of those results).
Having employees provide self-ratings and then comparing them to manager ratings is not recommended. Employee self-ratings are usually inflated, which may result in defensiveness, conflict, and bad feelings when managers do not agree with an employee’s ratings.
Instead, focus employee input on accomplishments and impact. This increases communication and understanding, decreases disconnects between the manager’s view and the employee’s view, and increases employee ownership and acceptance of the process. Accomplishments and impact can be included in part of the appraisal, and can be helpful in making pay or promotion decisions.

---

**Performance Evaluation (Cont.)**

**02 GET INPUT FROM OTHERS**
Ask for input from an employee’s peers, direct reports, and important partners in other departments or units. This type of input is often seen as especially credible and helpful for employees, and done as a simple conversation or through a more formal feedback process (i.e. survey).
Evaluate the relevance and usefulness of that input and compare it to other information about the person’s performance (e.g., your observations, available metrics).
If you use multi-source feedback, consider ways to focus this on learning and development rather than performance evaluation.

**03 EVALUATE THE RESULTS THE EMPLOYEE ACHIEVED**
Identify the employee’s most important accomplishments of the past year. Determine the impact those accomplishments had on the department, college or unit and the contribution they made to important goals and priorities.

**Results - the “What”**
**Context:** One of Nadia’s most important accomplishments this year was helping our new director of student services quickly learn how our office works, who the important people are within the college and across the University, and how to build good working relationships with our faculty and associate deans.
**Accomplishment:** Nadia created the onboarding plan and took responsibility for ensuring that it happened.
**Impact:** Her efforts allowed our new director to learn her role quickly and start identifying opportunities to improve student services within just a few weeks.

Use relevant, accurate metrics (if available) to inform your evaluation of the employee’s impact and contributions.
While objective indicators of performance (e.g., metrics) are often seen as the ideal, they are often not as accurate as they appear and can be affected by differences in opportunities available to employees. For example, one employee may be using outdated equipment, which lowers productivity, or they may be providing a service to units that have an especially complex set of needs compared to others, resulting in a slower process.

**04 EVALUATE HOW THEY ACHIEVED RESULTS**
Identify how the person was expected to achieve results. Including behaviors in the evaluation process is an important way of differentiating between employees who are performing more or less effectively than others. Ask yourself:
* Did they meet the behavioral expectations on a consistent basis?
* Did they consistently exceed these expectations?
* Did they perform below expectations much of the time?
Avoid focusing on too many competencies. Focus on those that are most important for achieving results. Typically, evaluating an employee on five to ten behavioral competencies* is plenty.

* Need more information on behavioral competencies? Go to z.umn.edu/competencies to learn more about the competency model developed at the University of Minnesota to support talent development discussions.

---

**Performance Evaluation (Cont.)**

**04 EVALUATE HOW THEY ACHIEVED RESULTS (CONT.)**
**Behaviors - the “How”**
**Example:** One of Mark’s goals for the year was to increase his effectiveness in focusing on important issues and projects without getting distracted by unimportant or low priority details. Mark demonstrated that he was able to focus his time and effort on his three most important projects, while effectively managing a number of lower priority issues that arose throughout the year. His growth in this competency allowed him to successfully complete his three projects on time.
If you did not include behavioral expectations in the goals for the current performance management cycle, include them as you set goals for the next year. Behavioral competencies are part of ongoing check-ins and are an important focus for coaching and feedback.

**05 WRITE THE PERFORMANCE REVIEW**
**The Rating**
**Scale:** Use a five-to-seven point rating scale in which each point on the scale is defined in a consistent and fair manner. Example scale: 5 - Exceptional, 4 - Exceeds Expectations, 3 - Meets Expectations, 2 - Improvement Needed, and 1 - Unsatisfactory.
**Ratings:** Provide ratings for both results and behaviors.
**Overall Rating:** Calculate an overall rating by averaging scores across each component of the review. If you rate performance on both results and behaviors, average the ratings rather than use a weighted average or a more complex scoring scheme.
Remember, employee self ratings are likely to be inflated and may create defensiveness during the review discussion; instead have them describe their accomplishments and impact, which can be incorporated into the review narrative.

**The Narrative**
**Reason for Rating:** Write a narrative to help the employee understand why they received a particular score.
**Specific Examples:** Include specific behavioral examples for each rating and be sure to describe the results achieved and the impact of those results. Examples of accomplishments provided by the employee and others can be incorporated into the narrative. Examples provided in narratives also identify areas for growth and development over the next year, setting the stage for goal-setting.
Take the time to be thoughtful and specific, as the narrative will be the most useful portion of the review for the employee. Narratives provide important feedback that helps the employee understand how they are performing relative to the expectations for their role.

If you aren’t already doing so, consider setting broad annual goals* for next year and then using ongoing flexible goal-setting for specific shorter-term goals. Flexible goal setting allows you to rate progress toward annual goals in a way that seems fair and relevant to employees.

* See the Quick Guide to Goal Setting for steps and best practices on setting up goals.

**Performance Evaluation (Cont.)**

**06 DISCUSS THE REVIEW WITH THE EMPLOYEE**
The steps below outline the research-supported best practices for having a review discussion. Your college, campus, or unit may have their own guidelines for delivering performance reviews; contact your local HR team to learn about the specific guidelines.
**Context:** If you had formal or informal ongoing check-ins throughout the year, summarize these discussions in the annual review conversation to provide context.
**Rating & Narrative:** Discuss the performance rating, the narrative, and the rationale for the rating the person received. Discuss both the results the person achieved as well as how they achieved those results (i.e., behaviors).
**Input:** Ask the employee to share their thoughts and opinions on each portion of the review.

**Addressing Challenges**
**Show empathy:** If anything surprises the employee (particularly anything negative), consider whether this is the first time they are hearing it. If it is, then let them know that you are aware that this is new information for them and give them time to consider what they have heard.
**Give time:** If they react defensively, expect that they will need time before they can have a productive conversation about how to address the information. If the employee is receiving regular feedback and coaching* throughout the year, nothing in an annual review should be a surprise.
**Focus on development:** Consider talking about developmental activities for the next year. The review session is often a good time to begin creating a development plan. Focus on the specific behaviors and skills that will help the person be successful.

When planning development activities, it is tempting to start by suggesting formal training or development programs. However, the vast majority of learning occurs on the job through development assignments and ongoing coaching.

* See the Quick Guide to Coaching for more information on the coaching process.

**A Quick Guide to Conflict Sources**

**What should I know about conflict sources?**
Conflict at work often stems from one or more of these conflict sources:
* TASK,
* PROCESS,
* RELATIONSHIP AND
* STATUS.
Understanding the root causes of a conflict will help you figure out how to manage it more effectively which may lead to solutions that resolve the conflict.
**Four sources of conflict:** Task, Process, Relationship, Status.

**Keys to Conflict Management**
**Don’t Avoid:** Conflict may be uncomfortable, but it can be productive.
**Unpack Conflict & Master Skills:** Most conflicts have more than one source and there are often layers (e.g., conflict about a project that has worsened to the point where team members are angry with each other). Depending on the conflict source and situation, mastering the following skills will help you manage conflict effectively: reflective listening, delayed response, using non-reactive statements, building rapport, unpacking the conflict, and finding common ground.
**Coach Others:** As a supervisor, members of your team or department will experience conflict with each other and with people in other areas. In these cases, instead of applying these skills yourself, your job is to provide feedback and coaching* so that they can learn and apply these skills too. The more comfortable you are using these skills and the more experience you have with them, the more you’ll be able to coach others to manage conflict effectively.

* See the Feedback and Coaching module for tips and best practices on providing effective feedback and coaching.

**How do I start?**
Review the four most common conflict sources below to learn what they might look like in the workplace and what skills and techniques are most effective.

---

**Conflict Sources (Cont.)**

**Task**
**What is it?** Differing ideas about WHAT work will be done, including plans, ideas, projects, or goals.
**What does it look like?** Disagreement about:
* What the top priority should be.
* The goal of a project.
* How to measure success.
* The agenda for a meeting.
**Where might you start?**
* Discuss each person’s views about priorities, goals, and plans. Be sure you let others know that you understand their viewpoints.
* Once everyone’s views are understood, consider what steps need to be taken to make final decisions about the work. This may involve further discussion about pros and cons of various options, a need for more information or input, or simply a decision from a leader or group. Consider how you, as a supervisor, can move things forward and address any roadblocks.
**Skills to master:** reflective listening, unpacking the conflict, finding common ground.

**Process**
**What is it?** Differing ideas about HOW to get the work done, including methods for making decisions and the steps and people involved in getting things done.
**What does it look like?** Disagreement about:
* Whether to take action now or wait and gather more information.
* How decisions will be made when there is a lack of agreement.
* The best way to put a new policy or practice in place.
**Where might you start?**
* Discuss each person’s views about how decisions should be made, the process for doing the work, and each person’s role. Be sure you let others know that you understand their viewpoints.
* Once everyone’s views are understood, consider what steps need to be taken to decide how the work will be done. This may involve further discussion about pros and cons of various options, a need for more information or input, or simply a decision from a leader or group. Consider how you, as a supervisor, can move things forward and address any roadblocks.
**Skills to master:** reflective listening, unpacking the conflict, finding common ground.

See the Mastering Conflict Management Skills section of the Managing Conflict module for “how-to’s“ and examples.

* Status symbols, such as the biggest office or the most impressive job title.
**Where might you start?**
* Minimize anger and frustration by clarifying who will be leading a project.*
* Aim to reach agreement on issues for both sides.*
**Skills to master:** delayed response, non-reactive statements, unpacking the conflict, finding common ground.

**Relationship**
**What is it?** Interpersonal conflict involving anger and hurt feelings.
**What does it look like?**
* Sending rude or highly critical emails back and forth.
* Interrupting and not letting someone finish speaking.
* Avoiding someone (e.g., not making eye contact, ignoring them when they try to talk with you).

**Where might you start?**
* Minimize anger and frustration by managing emotions.*
* Build enough mutual respect and trust that you can have a productive conversation about the work.
**Skills to master:** delayed response, non-reactive statements, reflective listening, trust building.

When a member of your team or department is involved in a conflict at work, your role as a supervisor is to provide feedback and coaching to help them develop and use effective conflict management skills. In many cases, you may not be directly involved, but your support will be important in helping the person manage the situation effectively.

**Get involved when**
* The conflict is interrupting you or your team’s work.
* The conflict is disruptive and counterproductive.
* One of more of your direct report’s behavior is inconsistent with expectations for HOW they are to get their work done*.

**Your role is to:**
* Ensure that others feel valued and respected regardless of their background.
* Coach others to find a productive way forward.
* Create and strengthen meaningful collaboration and teamwork.

The culture on your team will reflect the behaviors that are tolerated. Difficult and problematic behavior that is not addressed will set the tone and affect others. As a supervisor, it is your role to address such behavior through setting clear expectations for what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. Addressing unacceptable behavior is an important part of managing performance.

**Knowing When to Get Involved (Cont.)**

**What are the next steps?**

**PROVIDE FEEDBACK AND COACHING***
* Ensure that others receive timely, actionable, and constructive feedback and coaching so they are aware of the impact they have on others.
* Help others respond to unexpected problems with flexibility and resourcefulness so they can approach the conflict in a productive way.
* Be specific about behaviors and explain why a behavior was effective or ineffective, and help the person understand the situation, their behavior, and the impact of their behavior.
“Sara, when we were discussing Alex’s proposal in the meeting this morning and you kept interrupting him, it really shut down the conversation and I think Alex is pretty frustrated.”

**EFFECTIVELY MANAGE PERFORMANCE***
* Provide clear performance expectations, including expectations for HOW they work with others to achieve results. For example, behaviors such as the ability to “maintain productive relationships with others even when faced with conflict” or to “listen respectfully and openly to others regardless of level, position, or background” describe important performance expectations.
* Address performance problems right away. This includes behaviors and expectations related to how the work gets done. You can accomplish this through check-ins. Check-ins are regular discussions that happen throughout the year to:
    * Check in on progress toward goals,
    * Stay aligned on current projects,
    * Discuss what is going well and what could be better, and
    * Agree on next steps.
* Ongoing check-ins are the key to on-the-job learning, which is the single most important way people improve and grow at work.

*See the Feedback and Coaching and the Managing Performance modules for information on steps, tools and techniques.

**A Quick Guide to Conflict**
**Managing Your Emotions**

**Knowing When to Get Involved -> Managing Emotions (SKILL) -> Building Trust -> Seeking Solutions**
* **Managing Emotions (SKILL):** Practice Delayed Response, Use Non-reactive Statements.

When facing a conflict, it is normal to feel angry, frustrated, and stressed out. Managing these negative feelings allows you to focus on the situation in a productive way and to avoid doing and saying things that make the conflict worse. Reacting out of anger and frustration is not likely to resolve anything.

**How do I start?**
**Don’t:**
* Respond to someone by confronting them out of anger, whether by email or in person; it’ll only make the conflict worse.
* Take things personally; don’t assume other people’s responses are about you.
* “Take the bait” (being provoked / having your buttons pushed).
**Do:**
* Calm down to respond more productively.
* Set boundaries and limits; be clear about what you will and will not do.
* Pay attention to people, issues, and situations that can be emotionally difficult.
* Echo name-calling or hostile feedback, calmly and firmly ask: “Did I hear you correctly? Did you call me an idiot?” “Can you say that again?”
* Mentally rehearse a calm and rational response when you anticipate a “hot button” situation.
* Role play difficult situations with your supervisor, a colleague, or someone else so you can try self-control strategies.

Mastering two specific techniques will help you manage your emotions and approach the conflict more productively. These techniques are: practicing delayed response and using non-reactive statements.

---

**Managing Your Emotions (Cont.)**

**Techniques for staying calm and productive during conflict**

**Delayed Response**
When a conflict catches you by surprise or you are angry at someone, pause and think about the situation before responding.

**WHAT DOES THIS LOOK LIKE?**
**1. Pause > maintain composure > step back emotionally.**
* Be aware of your own thoughts and feelings.
* Sense your physical response.
* Control your body language: posture, breathing, facial expression, gestures.
* Consciously change your energy level.
**2. Manage the Moment**
* Pay attention to your physical space.
* Notice where you are by looking at the room.
* Make an effort to feel the floor beneath your feet.
* Listen to sounds in the room; notice the light source and people around you.
**3. Notice the Person**
* Demeanor, clothing, posture, face, tone of voice, communication style.
* Once you have done these three steps, then respond.

**Other tips:**
If you don’t need to respond in the moment, take a few hours or even a day or two, to consider the situation and the most productive way forward.

It is often tempting to vent frustration through email. There’s usually no harm in merely writing such an email, but sending it is often a mistake that makes the conflict worse and fails to resolve anything. If you are tempted to write an email, leave it in your “drafts” mailbox for a day or two. Come back to it and re-read or have a colleague provide feedback. Consider how the recipient is likely to respond. If it seems unlikely to be helpful, find another way to share your views.

---

**Managing Your Emotions (Cont.)**

**Use Non-Reactive Statements**
Non-reactive statements help you to calm down anger and frustration and focus on handling the situation productively.

**WHAT DOES THIS LOOK LIKE?**
**I see, I feel, I hope & expect, I will ...**
“Next time, I hope you’ll take a deep breath and think twice before venting your anger at your colleagues.”
**When you ... I feel ... because ...**
“When you tell me you agree with my decision but then complain about the decision to others on the team, I feel angry because it undermines my role as the supervisor.”
**In the future, my hope is ... I wish that ...**
“In the future, my hope is that you will feel comfortable asking me for help if you’re feeling stuck and aren’t sure what to do.”
**I will/will not ...**
“I will not respond to name-calling and blaming. I will have a calm, rational conversation about what went wrong and what we need to do to fix it.”
**I notice that ... and I assume that ... Is that true?**
“I notice that you have been missing meetings with the project team. I assume this means that you haven’t finished the work. Is that true?”

**Why vs. What**
WHY can invite escalation, WHAT focuses on behaviors and impact and is more productive.
**Don’t:** “Why did you say that to Felix?”
**Do:** “When you told Felix that you didn’t like his idea, I’m curious what you were hoping would happen. Can you help me understand?”

**But vs. And**
BUT can escalate conflict.
**Don’t:** “I know you want to focus on getting the project plan done, BUT we need you to spend time building a relationship with this donor first.”
**Do:** “I know you want to focus on getting the project plan done, AND we need you to spend time building a relationship with this donor first.”

**You should vs. I would like you to ...**
SHOULD can escalate conflict.
“I would like you to contact this client immediately and explain that we cannot fulfill his request.”

**A Quick Guide to Conflict**
**Building Trust**

**Knowing When to Get Involved -> Managing Emotions -> Building Trust (SKILL) -> Seeking Solutions**
* **Building Trust (SKILL):** Practice Reflective Listening, Build Rapport.

Even if you are starting with little trust or even some hostility, the foundation for effectively managing a conflict is to build whatever trust you can with the others involved. This may not be easy, especially when you are dealing with difficult behavior from another person, but it is your best path to success.
Reflective listening and building rapport allow you to focus on understanding the needs, issues, and priorities of the others involved, it will establish a line of communication that may allow you to identify possible solutions, or at least a path forward, and it will allow any strong emotions to subside.

**How do I start?**
The following techniques are key to building trust: reflective listening and building rapport.

**Reflective Listening**
Reflective listening is one of the key techniques in building trust as it helps:
* Provide an accurate understanding of what someone is thinking and how they are feeling.
* Reduce interpersonal conflict and addresses the underlying problem or source of the conflict.
* The other person build more self-awareness, possibly gain a new perspective, and feel heard.
Reflective listening goes beyond simply listening and involves these steps:
* Focusing on hearing what the person is saying and giving them your full attention.
* Demonstrating to the other person that you understand what they are trying to say.

---

**Build Trust (Cont.)**

**Reflective Listening (Cont.)**

**WHAT DOES THIS LOOK LIKE?**
**1. What is the person saying?**
* Relay your understanding back to the person in your own words.
* Make sure they agree that you accurately understand what they are trying to communicate.
**2. How are they feeling?**
* Pay attention to both verbal and nonverbal communication. E.g., if the person is sitting with his arms crossed and not making eye contact, this could indicate he is still not being heard.

**MASTERING REFLECTIVE LISTENING**
**Do:** Ask questions and make statements that encourage the person to clarify what they are thinking and how they are feeling.
* **Clarifying:** “It sounds like you’re not sure why your colleague disagreed with you in the meeting. Is that right?” “Could you give me an example of that?”
* **Understanding:** “It must be really frustrating when she says she agrees with you, but then goes to other people after the meeting and complains about you.”
* **Summarizing and Paraphrasing:** “So, you want his input on the project, but you find his way of asking questions irritating. Am I right about that? “It sounds like the expectations for how the two of you are to work together are unclear. How can I clarify this for you?”

**Do:** Ask open-ended questions and avoid closed questions. Open-ended questions allow for a more in-depth conversation. Closed questions have brief responses, often just one word, and don’t give the other person much opportunity to explain their thoughts and feelings.
* **Open-ended:** “What happened when you asked her for the information? “How did you handle it when she made those comments to you?
* **Closed:** “Did you get the information you needed?” “How many times has she made that comment to you?”

---

**Build Trust (Cont.)**

**Reflective Listening (Cont.)**
**Don’t:**
* Interrupt the other person.
* Give advice, change the subject, or judge what the person is saying.
* Share your own views or opinions until you have demonstrated to the other person that you accurately understand them.

**Build Rapport**
Let others know that your relationships with them are a priority to you, which will signal that you respect and value them. As a result, they’re willing to work with you in finding a resolution. This lays the foundation for finding common ground, which is a necessary step for resolving the conflict.

**WHAT DOES THIS LOOK LIKE?**
**Statements mentioning trust, fairness, cooperativeness in other side**
“ I really appreciate how cooperative and fair you are to work with. We clearly have different perspectives but it’s easy to discuss them with you.”
**Statements mentioning greater good**
“I know we don’t agree on everything, but we both know this work is really important for our lab.”
**Statements involving relationship building**
“I really want to work on this with you.”
“I hear your concern.”
“You clearly put a lot of work into this.”
“This would be hard for anyone.”
“I’d like to help you.”
“I want to see you succeed.”

**Other tips:**
Separate the person from the behavior, instead focus on the behaviors and the impact of those behaviors. Avoid name-calling, labelling, or judging others.
**Don’t - Labeling/Judging Person:** “Susan, you have such a big mouth! You talk too much! You don’t give anyone else a chance to say anything.”
**Do - Focus on Behavior:** “Susan, it’s great that you have so many ideas and that you share them with the team. However, it would be helpful if you could let others finish their thoughts before jumping in.”

**A Quick Guide to Conflict**
**Seeking Solutions**

**Knowing When to Get Involved -> Managing Emotions -> Building Trust -> Seeking Solutions (SKILL)**
* **Seeking Solutions (SKILL):** Unpack the Conflict, Find Common Ground.

Conflict can feel like a competition in which you either win or you lose. However, most of the time, there are solutions that will give everyone something they need. A key to managing conflict is to begin by understanding everyone’s interests, needs, and priorities and then think creatively about mutually beneficial solutions.
There is a set of specific skills that will help you unpack the conflict, find common ground, and identify these win-win solutions.

**Unpack the Conflict**
**WHAT DOES THIS LOOK LIKE?**
**1. Before looking for solutions, define the problem in a way that is mutually acceptable.**
Ask questions and share information about how each person sees the problem, the goals, and obstacles to reaching the goals.
* “What do you see as the real issue?“
* “What is the goal here? “
* “What do you think is getting in the way of solving this problem?”
**2. Identify and discuss each person’s interests, needs, desires, and fears.**
Ask questions and share information about the key issues and each person’s preferences on each issue.
* “It sounds like timing is a big issue for you. What would you like the timing to be?”
* “Cost is an important issue for me. I need to keep it no higher than what we spent last year.”

---

**Seeking Solutions (Cont.)**

**Unpack the Conflict (Cont.)**
**3. Restate and summarize the problem and the issues.**
“So, we need to come up with one set of recommendations that we both agree on. The biggest obstacle has been that we don’t know what each other’s priorities are. It’s important to you that whatever we recommend fits within the budget for this year and doesn’t require you to ask for more money. I need to get upgraded equipment for the labs. Is that accurate?”

**Find Common Ground**
Once you have unpacked the conflict to understand the problem and the needs and priorities of everyone involved, look for a solution that maximizes both parties’ interests.

**WHAT DOES THIS LOOK LIKE?**
**1. Based on the issues you identified when you unpacked the conflict, think creatively about alternative solutions.**
a. Find trade-offs that benefit both parties.
* What do you each have that the other wants?
* What do you both have that you can trade?
* What are you each comfortable giving away?
* Are there issues that are more important to one person than another?
b. Unbundle issues that can be separated.
c. Consider “package deals” where you combine multiple issues into one possible solution.
d. Brainstorm possible solutions and evaluate how acceptable they are to each person and why.
**2. Summarize all of the options you have identified.**
**3. Keep decisions tentative until a final proposal is complete.**
**4. Get commitment to the final agreement (e.g., in writing).**

**A Quick Guide to Leading Teams**
**Defining a Clear Purpose for Team Success**

**Define a clear purpose & describe success -> Clarify roles & responsibilities -> Establish norms that foster psychological safety -> Establish clear decision-making processes -> Manage team conflict**

Effective teams combine skills, knowledge and abilities in ways that result in good decisions and strong performance. Defining a clear purpose and describing team success is critical for building an effective team.

**What does this look like?**
At their best, teams can solve complex problems, achieve challenging goals, and generate innovative ideas. Teams are successful when they are clear on and agree about the purpose of the team. This includes the outcomes expected of the team, of individual team members, and for the people they serve (e.g. students, faculty, patients, etc.)
**Engagement in the team’s purpose:**
* Teams want to feel that what they do matters and has a meaningful impact.
* Team members want to know how their work is connected to the unit’s priorities and thus have ownership in what the organization is trying to achieve.
* Faculty and staff want to contribute to the success of something greater than themselves through their work.

**Signs you may have a problem**
* Team members pursue different agendas,
* Team members act irritated or frustrated with one another (relationship conflict),
* Team is unable to make a timely decision or makes bad decisions,
* Team members focus too much on individual performance at the expense of the team’s success.

**How to improve**
Identify and describe the purpose of the team. Ensure team members understand and agree on this. Consider and discuss with the team:
* What are our key goals? How will we achieve them?
* What are our specific objectives or deliverables?
* Why is this work important?

---

**Defining a Clear Purpose for Team Success (Cont.)**

Clarify organizational priorities and goals and how their work fits within the bigger picture. Discuss with your team:
* Why the team is focused on these particular strategies and goals.
* How the work is linked directly to our college/unit goals and the goals of the University.
* The results expected of the team.

Describe what success will look like:
* What will be different or better if the team succeeds?
* How will the team know if it is successful?
* What measures / metrics will demonstrate that the team is achieving success?
* What changes or improvements will result if the team is successful?

Coach your team:
* Hold regular check-in meetings to assess their progress.
* Focus on improving teamwork in addition to individual performance.
**Use these suggested questions for coaching a team:**
* What results are expected of the team and how are they connected with college/unit priorities?
* What is your understanding of what our key priorities are and why they are important?
* What are the goals/focus areas the team isn’t making progress on?
* What do we need to make progress?
* What’s standing in the way of the team being more engaged with our key priorities?

**A Quick Guide to Leading Teams**
**Clarifying Roles and Responsibilities**

**Define a clear purpose & describe success -> Clarify roles & responsibilities -> Establish norms that foster psychological safety -> Establish clear decision-making processes -> Manage team conflict**

Designing the roles and assigning the responsibilities for team members in a way that aligns their individual skills, knowledge and abilities with the work is one of the key steps of building an effective team. Having clear roles and responsibilities and communicating these with one another will help alleviate conflict and improve teamwork and decision-making.

**What does this look like?**
* The team has the right number of people with the right mix of skills and abilities as well as diverse perspectives to get the work done, based on the purpose of the team.
* Team roles are assigned based on expertise.
* Everyone knows what is expected from each team member.
* Individual roles and responsibilities are clear.
* Team members know how to prioritize issues as they arise and understand and agree on the plan for reaching key goals and objectives.
* Team members are able to succeed at each component of their job simultaneously and do not feel pulled in different directions.

**Signs you may have a problem**
* Inability to do certain aspects of the work due to the skill gaps on the team.
* Slow progress and inefficient work.
* Team members struggle to understand how to prioritize issues as they arise.
* Team members struggle to succeed at each component of their job simultaneously and are being pulled in two opposite directions at the same time.
* Confusion about who is responsible for what, resulting in conflict.
* If you have the Employee Engagement survey results*, a low score on the item of “There is an equitable distribution of workload within my department.”

*For more information on Employee Engagement survey and survey results see: ee.ltd.umn.edu.

**Clarifying Roles and Responsibilities (Cont.)**

**How to improve**
**Consider the purpose of the team, then determine who is on the team, who’s not, and why:**
* What skills, knowledge, and abilities are needed for success?
* Do you have the right people on the team?
* Are there skill gaps? Redundancies?
**Consider the team size:**
* Generally, the most effective teams are the smallest teams that have the skills, knowledge, and abilities required to get the work done.
* The size of teams can vary widely and for many important reasons, but five members often results in the greatest productivity, and benefits of a team: increased motivation, shared learning, and a larger pool of expertise - without too many of the downsides, such as: process conflict, inefficient coordination, and slower execution.
* When teams have more than nine members, it becomes difficult to get work done efficiently and the effort required from the leader to coordinate the work increases dramatically.
**Consider role clarity and expectations:**
* Are individual expectations clear? Be sure everyone on the team knows what is expected of them in terms of what they are expected to do (results) and how they are expected to work (behaviors).
* It is also important that the entire team is clear about every team member’s role, not just their own. Failure to do so will likely result in a conflict over how the work gets done or the work may not get done because everyone assumes someone else is responsible for it.

**Watch Out for Social Loafing**
Under certain circumstances, people will put forth less effort when working with others than when working alone.
* **What can cause this?** Belief that others are not carrying their fair share of the work, so effort is scaled back. Or, if individual performance is not evaluated or known, people may be tempted to become “free riders.”
* **How to address?** Be sure that each person’s individual contributions are assessed in addition to the team’s collective performance.

* Do people perceive that they have more work to do than others on the team? Lack of clarity about team members’ roles and responsibilities is heightened when team members have different busy seasons or work off-site frequently. Clarity helps build appreciation and respect within teams and it also helps teams become more interdependent. As a result, they’ll know who to turn to for assistance and how to help in case of a bottle neck. The Roles and Responsibilities Exercise on the next page can help improve role clarity within teams.

**Clarifying Roles and Responsibilities (Cont.)**

**Try it! Roles and Responsibilities Exercise**
This exercise works best shortly after a major change has taken place in your unit or department as it helps to resettle into a new normal. Misunderstandings about the work that people do can cause some hurt feelings; however, when colleagues already have good rapport, this doesn’t tend to be an issue.
**1-2 hours | under 10 people | flip chart paper, 2 color markers**
Want to go paperless? See z.umn.edu/RRExercise for a digital facilitation template
* Each team member receives a piece of flip chart paper posted on a wall with their name on it.
* With black markers – every team member is to spend 2-3 minutes at each flip chart (excluding their own) and write down the primary job responsibilities for each of their peers.
* Team members then return to their own flip charts with a red marker to edit the chart so that it accurately represents their role.
* Each team member then reports out what their primary responsibilities are, what flip chart edits they needed to make, and highlight the piece of their role that is currently the most challenging. If time allows – add an opportunity for discussion and feedback for each individual.
* **Debrief – what did you learn about yourself and others through this exercise?**
    * What about your role did team members accurately depict?
    * What did they get wrong?
    * Why do you think these discrepancies exist?
    * What is the thing you are struggling with the most right now?
    * Does anyone on the team have ideas for how to help or streamline?
* Have a note taker capture the key takeaways and email to the team post-exercise.

**Coach your team:**
* Are the team members getting too caught up in details or going off track?
* Are the team members becoming complacent?
* Is there a lack of fresh ideas?
The answers to these questions might not be known until the team is already formed and had a chance to work together. When building a team, appointing a “devil’s advocate,” or a person whose role is to challenge the status quo and ask tough questions can help the team avoid complacency, stay focused on a larger goal, and come up with more innovative solutions. A person playing this role might ask:
* Why are we doing this again?
* What problem are we trying to solve?
* What other options do we have?
* What happens if we don’t do this?

**A Quick Guide to Leading Teams**
**Establishing Norms and Expectations**

**Define a clear purpose & describe success -> Clarify roles & responsibilities -> Establish norms that foster psychological safety -> Establish clear decision-making processes -> Manage team conflict**

Establishing norms and expectations that foster psychological safety, which is a shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking, allows team members to communicate and coordinate their efforts effectively, resulting in stronger performance and better decisions.

**What does this look like?**
* The norms and expectations are explained and discussed by the team leader and are understood and agreed upon by the team members.
* The behaviors that fall outside of the norms are addressed promptly.

**NORMS THAT FOSTER PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY**
* **Everyone practices reflective listening.***
    * Gives undivided attention when someone is speaking.
    * Shows that they are listening and seeking to understand what the person is trying to say.
* **Everyone consistently contributes to discussions.**
* **No one dominates the discussion, shuts other people down, or sidetracks the team with unimportant or irrelevant issues.** When these things happen, the leader addresses it right away and gets the team back on track.
* **Team members actively communicate with each other rather than only talking to the leader.**
**Communication patterns:** Communication in teams with high psychological safety follows a “web” pattern rather than a “hub and spokes.“ (WEB vs HUB)
* **Team members regularly consult with each other and bring ideas back to the full team.**

*See the Building Trust quick guide of the Managing Conflict module for more information on reflective listening.

---

**Establishing Norms and Expectations (cont.)**

**Signs you may have a problem**
* Team members demonstrate that they do not understand or agree with the norms.
* Team members are not consistently following the norms or violating them and are not trying to improve their behavior.
* The supervisor often has to intervene and coach team members on expectations for how they work together.
* Team members have a “meeting after the meeting.“
**What is a “meeting after the meeting?”** Two or more team members get together after the full team meeting (in person or online) to express concerns or complain about something that was discussed. However, they did not share their views during the meeting, so others are unaware of their concerns.
* Team members are not fully participating in discussions, instead the discussions are dominated by one or two people.
* Team members are reluctant to admit their mistakes or when they don’t know something.
* The issues, regardless of their complexity, are all brought to leadership for resolution.

**How to improve**
* For new teams or teams with new members, set time aside to discuss the norms.
* When someone does not follow these norms, provide feedback and coaching.**
* Identify and resolve any misunderstandings or lack of agreement on norms.*
* Frame the issues as opportunities for learning and continuous improvement.
* **Model these behaviors** - the team will follow your lead, so be sure you are working on practicing these behaviors yourself:
    * Ask for feedback regularly.
    * Acknowledge and admit your own mistakes/fallibility.
    * Ask for and welcome different perspectives.
    * Ask open ended questions and practice reflective listening.*

**A Quick Guide to Leading Teams**
**Establishing Clear Decision-Making Processes**

**Define a clear purpose & describe success -> Clarify roles & responsibilities -> Establish norms that foster psychological safety -> Establish clear decision-making processes -> Manage team conflict**

Being intentional and clear about how decisions are made helps teams avoid conflict and wasted effort, and improves the quality of team decisions.

**What does this look like?**
* The team makes decisions in an efficient, effective manner.
* Team members agree on how to make important decisions and how much time and energy should be devoted to each decision.
* Everyone is clear about their role in decision-making.
* Team members make decisions based on evidence and analysis, rather than personality clashes.

**Signs you may have a problem**
* There is frequent disagreement among team members about how to make decisions and what each person’s role in a decision should be.
* Team members’ expertise is treated as equal when decisions involve a specific area of expertise.
* Unilateral decisions are made when there is a lot at stake and a consensus, or at least a majority, is needed. As a result, people who were not consulted push back and resist decisions.
* Conversely, a lot of time and energy is spent trying to gain a consensus for a decision that really doesn’t require it.
* The team often spends too much time on less important and less risky decisions or too little time on important or risky decisions.

---

**Establishing Clear Decision-Making Processes (cont.)**

**Signs you may have a problem (cont.)**

**Watch Out for Groupthink/Groupshift**
When there is strong pressure for consensus, team members may not raise critical questions, concerns, or objections to the dominant view. This can result in poor, or even disastrous, team decisions that could have been avoided had dissenting views been voiced earlier. One version of this, called Groupshift, can cause a group to take on increasingly extreme views and end up talking themselves into taking a much bigger risk than they realize or initially intended.
* **What can cause this?** In addition to pressure for consensus, teams that have a high level of confidence in their course of action and a focus on performance at the expense of learning, are at higher risk for Groupthink.
* **How to address?** Actively seek input from all members of the team. Have someone on the team play a role of “devil’s advocate” or contrarian - a person whose role is to challenge the status quo and ask tough questions can help the team to avoid complacency, stay focused on a larger goal and come up with more innovative solutions. Avoid expressing your opinion as the leader until other views have been voiced. Have team members consider an issue individually and write down their thoughts before having a group discussion. Then, have each team member share their views before opening up a full group discussion.

**How to improve**
**Clarify each person’s role in decision-making.**
For each person, is their role to:
* [ ] Make recommendations?
* [ ] Provide input?
* [ ] Exercise veto power if they object (i.e., their agreement is required to proceed)?
* [ ] Make the final decision?
* [ ] Carry out the decision (i.e., perform the work)?

**Clarify the best way to make a particular decision.** Determine and clarify within the team:
* When do you need a majority to support a decision?
* Which decisions require consensus?
* Does everyone get a veto?
* How much external buy-in do you need?
* How much risk is there in the decision?
* What would the likely consequences be of a wrong decision?

**A Quick Guide to Building Work Stress Resilience**

Managing work stress is all about building your capacity to adapt well and bounce back from difficult circumstances. As a supervisor, you can serve as a role model to your team in becoming more resilient and preventing burnout. How? You have the ability to lessen many of work’s greatest stressors for the individuals you supervise.

**What are work stressors?**
Work stressors are common in the workplace due to increasing demands and limited resources. Below are the four most common work stressors:
* **Role Conflict:** Facing conflicting demands (i.e. succeeding at one part of the job will mean failure in another part).
* **Role Ambiguity:** When expectations and goals are not well understood (i.e. unsure of responsibilities and how to prioritize issues as they come up; lack of clarity about what success looks like).
* **Interpersonal Conflict:** When disagreements and conflict become personal and emotional, and are not addressed.
* **Lack of Social Support:** Feeling disconnected from others within and outside of work; lack of help solving problems or not enough emotional support.

**What happens when work stressors linger?**
Burnout. This is how the mind and body try to cope with a high level of ongoing work stress. These are the three most common symptoms of burnout:
* **Exhaustion:** being tired and worn out, or feeling “drained” of energy.
* **Cynicism:** disengagement or detachment from the work. This can sound like: “I don’t even care. I’m done, I’m over it.”
* **Inefficacy:** feeling helpless and ineffective, having trouble concentrating, and decreasing in productivity.

Burnout can impact performance. It’s easy to write people off when you start to see these types of behaviors, but first consider, might they be overwhelmed or need more support?

**Symptoms of Burnout:** Exhaustion, Cynicism, Inefficacy.

**Watch Out for: Compassion Fatigue**
If you work with other people (e.g., direct reports, students, clients, patients, etc.), you might experience compassion fatigue when:
* You consistently work with others who are experiencing a high level of stress
* You have a high capacity for empathy
* You’re in a work environment where work/life balance is not

---

**Building Work Stress Resilience (Cont.)**

**What can I do to prevent burnout?**
Preventing burnout involves effectively managing work stressors which requires resilience.
* **What is resilience?** Resilience is your own capacity to adapt well, and helping your teams and departments adapt in the face of stress, change, and uncertainty. It means “bouncing back” from difficult experiences.
* **Keep In Mind Individual Differences:** We all have different temperaments and the ability to adjust which lead some of us to handle stress more naturally and easily than others. Regardless of these factors, resilience can be learned and developed.
* **Recharge:** Be intentional about creating time to relax and recharge: free time between the workdays, during weekends, and holidays or vacations. At work, schedule short breaks or try unscheduled breaks by shifting your attention to other work tasks.

**Watch Out for: the “Dark Side“ of Resilience**
Is there such a thing as too much resilience? Yes. Resilience can be overused, which can lead to strengths becoming weaknesses. In addition, people who are overly resilient may not realize they are reaching the threshold of doing too much, risking burnout. For example, overly resilient people may:
* **Focus on unattainable goals,** which may lead to them eventually giving up. For example, taking on a leadership role or challenging project without carefully thinking through the time and effort it will take. At a certain point they might realize that they have overestimated their abilities and will have no choice but to give up or ask for help.
* **Take on more than they can manage,** which might encourage leaders to assign them even more projects and assignments. Leaders may not recognize that these individuals might be close to burning out.
* **Accept an unhealthy or even toxic work culture or environment.** Overly resilient people may not realize when a toxic work culture is beginning to impact their health and well-being. They may do their best to adapt to a bad situation even when it is harmful.

As a supervisor, you can help your team to adapt to difficult circumstances by coaching them to use effective coping strategies by reducing or even removing work stressors.

---

**Building Work Stress Resilience (Cont.)**

**How can I build resilience around work stressors?**
Building resilience is an ongoing skill that requires self-awareness and practice with the outcome of viewing yourself positively and having confidence in your strengths. Building resilience also means finding healthy ways to manage the stress at work and the ability to coach your team to use effective coping skills.

**01 DETERMINE YOUR LEVEL OF CONTROL**
Focus on what you can control and respond accordingly:

**Control:** This is where you have the most influence and control. Focus on making progress toward important goals, skill building, and taking the time to manage your own stress by considering:
* What are some things you can control in the short-term and long-term? Oftentimes, we do have the ability to influence and control things in the long-term.
* Ask yourself, “What is one thing I know I can accomplish now that will move me forward?”
* How are you feeling about your own needs and what do you need to do to take care of yourself?

**Influence:** Here you have some level of influence and control but it may require collaboration with others. Consider:
* Are you confident in your skills to solve problems rather than detaching from challenging situations, wishing they would just go away?
* Do you have self-awareness and know the circumstances and people that might trigger stress in you?
* Are you able to trust your ability to use your strengths in working through stressful situations?

**No control/Influence:** This is where decisions may have a significant impact to you or your team/department, but no one asks for your opinion about it. Consider:
* Can you be adaptable when things change and be willing to accept that goals and plans may need to shift accordingly?
* Do you look at challenging events outside of your control to discover more about yourself and how you might use these circumstances as a means of personal growth?
If you are trying to adapt to a fundamentally unhealthy situation that is out of your control, you will burn out (See the “Dark Side” of Resilience above).

As a supervisor, part of your job is helping people see what they can control and helping coach them on how they can influence a situation.
If having no control or influence causes burnout, it’s time to consider if you are in the right job or situation or if it might be time to walk away.

**Building Work Stress Resilience (Cont.)**

**02 SELECT A COPING STRATEGY**
If you do have influence/control then you can cope with a situation through problem solving, reframing the situation, or managing its impact. As a supervisor, you can coach individuals to do the same.

**A. Problem-solving**
Resilient people find the most productive way forward by either adjusting the growing demands at work or by seeking more resources to help meet those demands. Understanding the main source of work stress will help you address it, or even remove it:
* **Role Conflict: Clarify roles and responsibilities.** Are individual expectations clear? Does everyone on the team know what others on the team are doing? Be sure everyone on the team knows what is expected of them in what (results) they are doing and how (behaviors) they are expected to work.
* **Role Ambiguity: Provide ongoing feedback and coaching.** Talk regularly about capacity, goals, and progress towards the goals. Help set boundaries with client and other external requests.
* **Interpersonal Conflict: Use of conflict management skills.** Start by managing emotions and practicing reflective listening.* Help determine the source of conflict and encourage team members to be open in asking for and providing support to one another.
* **Lack of Support: Support by managing emotions and solving problems in day-to-day work.** Recognize even small successes in team meetings and in other ways, noting the impact their efforts have made on others. Let others know that your relationships with them are a priority to you, which will signal that you respect and value them. Establish and revisit the norms that foster psychological safety,** this will help improve honest and open communication.

* See the Managing Emotions and Building Trust quick guides, part of the Managing Conflict module for more information on delayed response, non-reactive statements, and reflective listening.
** See the Quick Guide to Establishing Norms and Expectations, part of the Leading Teams module for more information on psychological safety.

**Building Work Stress Resilience (Cont.)**

**02 SELECT A COPING STRATEGY (CONT.)**

**B. Reframing the problem**
If the stressor cannot be removed and still remains, take a closer look at your mindset and assumptions. Often times what seems like a crisis, is not actually one. Consider how such situations fit within the bigger picture.
* Do you tend to overreact to minor issues or take things too personally?
* What are some things you can control in the short-term and long-term? Can priorities be shifted?

**C. Managing the impact**
If there is no or very little control over the work stressor, then focus your effort on managing its impact by prioritizing self care, and, if possible, removing or distancing yourself from the difficult situation.
* Are you or your direct report(s) being mindful about self-care (healthy eating, exercise, sleep, etc.)?
* Can you remove yourself or your direct report(s) from parts of the difficult situation?
* What can be re-assigned or delegated?
* Could you build some positive, supportive relationships to counteract the ones that drain you?

Stress at work is a growing concern that causes loss of productivity and engagement that might lead to burnout. Knowing the most common work stressors will help you determine the most productive way forward and build resilience in you, your team, and department.

**A Quick Guide to Employee Engagement**

**What is employee engagement?**
Employee engagement is the extent to which individuals devote time, energy and effort at work. The highest levels of engagement result from facing meaningful challenges while also having the support, resources, and confidence needed to address those challenges.
At the University of Minnesota, we think of employee engagement as a level of employee energy and motivation supported or hindered by the work environment.
When talking about employee engagement, we look at **two key metrics:**
* **Commitment and Dedication:** Commitment, motivation and pride for the work and organization, and
* **Effectiveness of the Work Environment:** Conditions that allow individuals to be effective in their jobs and remove barriers to productivity.
**EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT AT THE U:** Commitment & Dedication + Effective Work Environment.

**Why is it important?**
Employee engagement is linked with a range of important outcomes for the wellbeing and productivity of employees and the organization’s reputation.
Engaged employees remain
* fully focused,
* energetic,
* mentally resilient, and
* stay committed and involved,
* say positive things about their workplace and recommend it to others
which leads to increased recruitment and retention, increased job performance, and going above and beyond for the good of colleagues and the organization.
Ultimately, enhancing employee engagement helps achieve and sustain a higher level of productivity, and increase retention of talented faculty and staff by fostering better working relationships, collaboration and resilience.
Today’s challenges require new ways of thinking and working together. Engagement helps align goals with effective workplace practices which can be a game changer!

---

**Employee Engagement (Cont.)**

**How do I improve employee engagement?**
Improving on the following conditions, also known as “engagement drivers,“ can help create a higher level of engagement:
1. **Clear and Promising Direction:** Ensure that staff and faculty understand how their work is connected to the goals of the department, college, campus, and University.
2. **Commitment to Excellence:** Set and encourage high expectations for the quality of work, including demonstrating a commitment to excellence and continuous improvement.
3. **Confidence in Leaders:** Communicate openly and honestly to build trust and confidence in leadership.
4. **Development Opportunities:** Encourage the ongoing learning and development of skills and knowledge and ensure everyone has opportunities to receive coaching and mentoring.
5. **Respect and Recognition:** Interact respectfully and consistently recognize good work and meaningful contributions.
6. **Authority and Empowerment:** Ensure that everyone has the autonomy they need to accomplish their work and the empowerment to make decisions.
7. **Clear Expectations and Feedback:** Define roles, responsibilities, and performance expectations and provide regular feedback.
8. **Collaboration:** Expect and support cooperation and the sharing of ideas within and across the organization.
9. **Support and Resources:** Ensure everyone has the skills, training, information, and resources needed to succeed.
10. **Work, Structure, and Process:** Actively manage workload so that it is distributed equitably, aligns with goals and priorities, and allows for improvements in the way work is done.

**Where do I start?**
Begin with employees who are frustrated. Why? When an employee has high commitment and dedication but is in an environment that has barriers that don’t allow them to be effective in their jobs, they will be frustrated, but these are often high-potential employees. If the source of their frustration is not addressed, they typically do one of three things:
* find innovative ways around environmental barriers and become engaged;
* get tired of challenging environmental barriers and leave the organization; or
* lower their expectations and become disengaged.
**Commitment & Dedication vs Effective Environment:** Detached, Engaged, Disengaged, Frustrated.

As a supervisor, focusing on what you can do to support the work of your employees and help remove barriers will present the greatest opportunity for improving employee engagement.

**Employee Engagement (Cont.)**

**Employee Engagement Cycle**
Employee Engagement is an ongoing process, that consists of three stages:
* **Input** - getting feedback through regular check-ins, meetings, or the University employee engagement survey.
* **Discussion** - discussing informal feedback, employee engagement survey data, clarifying and prioritizing the issues.
* **Action** - taking action on feedback and updating on progress.
**Employee Engagement Cycle:** INPUT -> DISCUSSION -> ACTION.

**Key Steps to Success**

**01 FOLLOW UP**
Asking for input alone, whether it’s through regular check-ins, meetings, or a formal engagement survey does not create positive change. Involving leaders, faculty, and staff in discussing the feedback and deciding how to take action is what can create positive change in the work environment.
Disengagement begins when people who take time to provide feedback or respond to a survey don’t hear back from their leaders.

**02 TAKE ACTION AND COMMUNICATE**
A few small, simple actions can have a large impact. As a supervisor, it’s encouraged that you ask faculty and staff for their ideas for taking action. Sometimes those closest to the work have the best ideas. Be certain to let them know when actions were taken based on their feedback.

**03 ALIGN WITH YOUR GOALS AND PRIORITIES**
Employee engagement is not extra work when it’s already embedded in the everyday work and is aligned with the organization’s goals and priorities. Focusing on engagement helps get the work done.

---

**A Quick Guide to Employee Engagement Cycle: Input**

Employee Engagement is an ongoing process that consists of three stages: input, discussion and action.
Input involves gathering perspectives on the following questions:
* How are we doing when it comes to creating the conditions that foster employee engagement? See the *What input do I gather* section below.
* What are we doing well?
* Where do we need to do better?
**Employee Engagement Cycle:** INPUT -> DISCUSSION -> ACTION.

**What input do I gather?**
Use these questions to gather input on the conditions (engagement drivers) that create engagement and productivity:
1. **Clear and Promising Direction:** Is there understanding and personal connection to the organization’s strategy and goals?
2. **Commitment to Excellence:** Is there support and encouragement for excellence in their work and that of the organization?
3. **Confidence in Leaders:** Are communications open enough so that it builds trust and confidence in leaders?
4. **Development Opportunities:** Do individuals have support for their professional and career development?
5. **Respect and Recognition:** Are interactions respectful with contributions recognized consistently?
6. **Authority and Empowerment:** Do employees have the autonomy to accomplish work and empowerment to make decisions?
7. **Clear Expectations and Feedback:** Are the skills, training, information, and resources available to do the job well?
8. **Collaboration:** Are roles and responsibilities clear with performance expectations and regular feedback on how well the expectations of the role are being met?
9. **Support and Resources:** Is there cooperation and sharing of ideas within and across the organization?
10. **Work, Structure, and Process:** How is the work distributed? Is it in line with goals and priorities?

**How do I gather input?**
Input can be gathered in a variety of ways:
* Conversations in 1:1 meetings
* Conversations in faculty or staff meetings
* Individual or team discussions facilitated by someone external to the team (e.g., a consultant)

---

**Employee Engagement Cycle: Input (Cont.)**

**How do I gather input? (Cont.)**
* **Employee Engagement survey.** The University of Minnesota has a biennial employee engagement survey. Review survey data from your immediate group or team (if available). If your immediate group or team did not have enough survey data to get a report, ask for and review survey data from the next level up in your organization such as your college, campus or unit. Ask your team if they believe their responses would be similar or different to those at the next level of the organization and/or the organization as a whole. Why or why not?
* **Asking informal questions or facilitate a discussion using the engagement driver questions.** In practice, the input and discussion phases might not be so distinct - especially if formal engagement survey data is unavailable. In those cases, input and discussion may happen at the same time. For example:
    * Hand out the list of engagement drivers* and ask team members to spend five minutes identifying which three are the strongest and which three are in most need of attention. Have team members write down their rationale for each one.
* See the Employee Engagement Discussion Questions quick guide for a full list of drivers along with a list of suggested questions by driver.
    * Have each person share their thoughts.
    * Open up a full team discussion.

**When gathering input, consider:**

**01 FOCUSING ON DEVELOPMENT**
Be clear that the purpose of gathering input is to inform development and facilitate continuous improvement, NOT to evaluate you or your team’s performance. This creates openness to hearing the input and taking action.**
** See the Establishing Norms and Expectations quick guide of the Leading Teams module for more information.

**02 BEING OPEN AND HONEST**
The best approach is to be honest and straightforward in seeking and discussing input. If you have tried to have open and honest conversations about the feedback but it does not help, or you feel defensive and cannot put those feelings aside for a conversation, or if you think employees may not feel comfortable sharing feedback about a particular topic, it may be helpful to have your local HR team or an outside third party (e.g. external consultant) facilitate this conversation.

**Employee Engagement Cycle: Input (Cont.)**

**When gathering input, consider (cont.):**

**03 MANAGING YOUR EMOTIONS**
For most of us, feedback is not always easily received, and the idea of change can be difficult, even for experienced supervisors.
Be aware of your own emotions and responses to the input gathered before sharing informal feedback/survey data with your direct reports and refining an action plan. It’s very normal to experience a range of reactions including shock, anger, resistance, and acceptance. You can unintentionally derail engagement if your own reactions to the input causes you to avoid taking action or act negatively.
It’s more beneficial when you have the mindset of seeking help when you share informal feedback/survey data with your direct reports. This frame of mind can prevent the informal feedback/survey data from being presented in a way that may appear defensive or as explaining away unfavorable results. It also shows your team that you are open to hearing possible ideas for action and potential solutions.

**04 FOLLOWING UP**
Finally, remember that asking for input and not doing anything with it is worse than not asking for input at all!

---

**A Quick Guide to Employee Engagement Cycle: Discussion**

Employee engagement is an ongoing process that consists of three stages: input, discussion, and action.
Once you have gathered input, make sure to recognize and celebrate strengths first. This will allow your team to continue to be successful in areas that are creating engagement! The goal of discussion is to answer the following questions rather than problem-solve:
* Which issues are the most important to address, given our goals and priorities?
* Which issues will get in our way if we don’t address them?
* Which issues are not a high priority, even if they could use improvement?
**Employee Engagement Cycle:** INPUT -> DISCUSSION -> ACTION.

In practice, the input and discussion phases might not be so distinct - especially if formal engagement survey data is unavailable. In those cases, input and discussion may happen at the same time.

**How do I discuss the input?**
Effective discussion involves making sense of the input by placing it within the context of the team/department, prioritizing the issues that affect your group’s goals, and a deeper understanding of those issues to create an action plan to address them.
**EFFECTIVE DISCUSSION:** 1. INPUT, 2. CONTEXT, 3. PRIORITIES, 4. UNDERLYING ISSUES.

**1. Begin with gathering the input.**
Input examples: employee engagement survey reports, notes or summaries of conversations, feedback, etc.

**2. Consider the context of when the input was gathered and identify what influenced the responses.**
It is important to consider changes over the last year as well as what events and context were occurring when the input was gathered. Inviting your employees to discuss the context for their input can help clarify and create a deeper understanding of the issues.
While external factors can influence employee engagement, be sure not to discount feedback solely based on the impact of these external factors. Faculty and staff can help you find ways of taking action locally to address the important issues.

**Employee Engagement Cycle: Discussion (Cont.)**

**3. Determine which issues need to be addressed to advance your team/department’s goals and priorities.**
Choose 1-3 areas that are most critical for advancing goals and priorities. Discuss how these fit within the bigger picture, why the team should be prioritizing these issues, and how addressing these issues will contribute to the overall success in achieving goals.*
* See the *Defining a Clear Purpose for Team Success* quick guide for steps on making these connections.

**4. Seek a deeper understanding of the specific underlying issues.**
**Ask yourself.** Each of the engagement drivers has a list of self-reflection questions* that will help you dig deeper.
**Ask your team.** Each of the engagement drivers has a list of discussion questions* that you can ask your team/department to help make sense of their feedback and clarify the issues. Make sure to ask these questions and give everyone time to reflect. These discussion questions can be used as part of meetings or 1:1 conversations.
* See the *Employee Engagement Self-Reflection Questions* and *Employee Engagement Discussion Questions* quick guides for a full list of questions by driver.

**How do I facilitate a discussion?**
There are several ways to go about facilitating an employee engagement feedback discussion, it can be formal or informal, and with or without help from a third party. When thinking about options that will work for your team/department, consider your own emotions** and possible defensiveness as well as the ways to create trust** to ensure comfort with having difficult conversations.

**Ideas for structuring discussions:**
* Informal discussion in 1:1 check-ins or group discussions (e.g., faculty or staff meeting).
* Formal discussion with or without the supervisor. Consult with your local HR team for possible options.
* If you have tried to have open and honest conversations about the feedback but it doesn’t help, or you feel defensive and cannot put those feelings aside for a conversation, or if you think employees may not feel comfortable sharing feedback specifically about a particular topic, consider bringing in an external consultant.

** See the Managing Emotions and Building Trust quick guides of the Managing Conflict module for tips and techniques.

**Employee Engagement Cycle: Discussion (Cont.)**

**Tips for leading a successful group discussion**

**AVOID PROBLEM-SOLVING**
It’s important to avoid problem-solving during a discussion as it may hinder idea creation. This provides an opportunity to share ideas, and confirm major strengths and opportunities for the team.

**CREATE THE RIGHT CLIMATE AND TONE**
Leaders can facilitate a positive feedback discussion by establishing realistic expectations for participating in the session. In addition, it’s important to:
* Recognize the risk that members of your group/team take by speaking out and sharing feedback verbally.
* As the leader, you set the tone by clearly stating that you are not interested in who answered positively or negatively.
* See the Quick Guide to Establishing Norms and Expectations for steps on creating the right climate.

**ESTABLISH DISCUSSION AGENDA**
* Focus on the main input themes to avoid overwhelming people with information. In all communications, give a balanced picture to establish credibility and remember the strengths of your team.
* Try not to appear defensive during the session, rationalize negative feedback results, or shift responsibility.
* As you lead the session, summarize your understanding of the feedback and reflect back the team’s input. Highlight priority issues and next steps to ensure everyone knows what they can expect next.

**As you lead the discussion, watch out for:**
* Silence, this could mean the group is confused or disagrees with something you say. Take time to pause and clarify.
* Because your goal is to hear ideas to develop a deeper understanding, beware of making premature commitments and/or defer proposed solutions.
* Be careful not to use the words “need” or “should” as they may be too solution focused for the purpose of the discussion.

**A Quick Guide to Employee Engagement Drivers and Self-Refection Questions**

**What are the employee engagement drivers?**
Employee engagement drivers are specific conditions that create engagement. Improving these conditions will create a higher level of engagement which leads to increased recruitment and retention, increased job performance, and employees going above and beyond for the good of their colleagues and the organization.

**Ten employee engagement drivers**
1. **Clear and Promising Direction:** Ensure that staff and faculty understand how their work is connected to the goals of the department, college, campus, and University.
2. **Commitment to Excellence:** Set and encourage high expectations for the quality of work, including demonstrating a commitment to excellence and continuous improvement.
3. **Confidence in Leaders:** Communicate openly and honestly to build trust and confidence in leadership.
4. **Development Opportunities:** Encourage the ongoing learning and development of skills and knowledge and ensure everyone has opportunities to receive coaching and mentoring.
5. **Respect and Recognition:** Interact respectfully and consistently recognize good work and meaningful contributions.
6. **Authority and Empowerment:** Ensure that everyone has the autonomy they need to accomplish their work and the empowerment to make decisions.
7. **Clear Expectations and Feedback:** Define roles, responsibilities, and performance expectations and provide regular feedback.
8. **Collaboration:** Expect and support cooperation and the sharing of ideas within and across the organization.
9. **Support and Resources:** Ensure everyone has the skills, training, information, and resources needed to succeed.
10. **Work, Structure, and Process:** Actively manage workload so that it is distributed equitably, aligns with goals and priorities, and allows for improvements in the way work is done.

**What’s Next?**
As a supervisor, you are also a leader, and it is important to understand the engagement drivers and place them within the context of your work. This will help you gather feedback in a way that is meaningful and makes a difference; it will also help you prepare for effective team discussions and prioritize an action plan to achieve the goals and priorities of your unit or department.
Review each of the engagement drivers and the self-reflection questions* in this guide to gain a deeper understanding of employee engagement at the University of Minnesota.
* See the *Employee Engagement Discussion Questions* quick guide for a list of suggested questions to discuss with your faculty or staff.

---

**Employee Engagement Drivers and Self-Reflection Questions (Cont.)**

**1. Clear and Promising Direction:** Ensure that staff and faculty understand how their work is connected to the goals of the department, college, campus, and University.
**Why it’s important.** Employees look for opportunities to contribute to something larger than themselves and to make a difference. Supporting faculty and staff in connecting their work to the goals of the department, college, and university is critical to creating a high level of engagement. The University of Minnesota’s mission to teach, research, and serve the public should be tied to the work of every University employee. College and unit goals should directly influence and connect to the work of its faculty and staff.
**SELF-REFLECTION QUESTIONS**
* How do I share important information I receive from leadership?
* When strategy and goals are communicated to faculty and staff, how are the reasons behind the strategy and goals communicated?
* How has my unit changed over the past few years? What changes are yet to come and why? How do I communicate this to faculty and staff?
* How do I make connections between what people want to learn and do and the future work of my area? Do I ask people what they want to know, and what they want to learn about so that I can provide them information and direction?
* How do I speak to employees about how their contribution helps both the college/unit and the University of Minnesota achieve its goals?

**2. Commitment to Excellence:** Set and encourage high expectations for the quality of work, including demonstrating a commitment to excellence and continuous improvement.
**Why it’s important.** Delivering high-quality education and research is critical to the University’s success. Ensuring that employees are working together toward these common goals requires an environment that encourages and supports teamwork as well as promotes innovation and continuous improvement. Engaged faculty and staff want to contribute to the success of something greater than themselves through their work.
**SELF-REFLECTION QUESTIONS**
* Have I established and documented quality standards in my college/unit? How do I hold individuals accountable?
* How do we measure service delivery? How does my area seek and use feedback from those receiving services from us? Are those results freely shared and celebrated?
* Where is quality routinely superior or routinely a problem? What do we have in place to address these?
* How do I invite faculty and staff input on ways to maintain or improve quality and/or service? How do I invite employee ideas on ways to overcome barriers?
* Has increased workload had an impact on quality? If so, how can we meet our workload demands while still maintaining high levels of quality? What can be changed to ensure that the highest priority items are done in a high quality, timely manner?

---

**Employee Engagement Drivers and Self-Reflection Questions (Cont.)**

**3. Confidence in Leaders:** Communicate openly and honestly to build trust and confidence in leadership.
**Why it’s important.** The success of your college/unit depends largely on the quality of its leaders throughout all levels of the organization. Leaders influence how faculty and staff perceive the college/unit as a whole and play a critical role in reinforcing strategies and goals. Effective leaders deliver key messages and share important information with employees in their group in a concise, relevant, and timely manner. Employees will have high levels of engagement when they understand the college/unit’s strategies and goals, and are confident that leaders are capable of achieving objectives.
**SELF-REFLECTION QUESTIONS**
* What procedures and processes are in place to ensure that employees get information about important changes in a timely and consistent manner? Do employees hear rumors before there is an opportunity to communicate important information directly to them?
* Do I avoid communicating certain types of information to faculty and staff? How is “bad news” shared with employees? How does my personal style affect the way my communications are received? How can I solicit feedback on this?
* How do I hold poor performing employees accountable for their performance?
* How do I take responsibility for my mistakes? How do I respond when I don’t have an answer?

**4. Development Opportunities:** Encourage the ongoing learning and development of skills and knowledge and ensure everyone has opportunities to receive coaching and mentoring.
**Why it’s important.** Development is often cited in engagement research as one of the top drivers of engagement which includes the ongoing learning and development of skills and knowledge, including job mastery and professional development, coupled with career planning activities. To remain motivated and productive, employees need to grow in their jobs–and perhaps grow beyond them. Given the changing nature of work, employees may need encouragement and support in reviewing and assessing their goals and the activities that support those goals. Leaders are in a position to provide valuable career coaching and feedback to help employees reach their career objectives.
**SELF-REFLECTION QUESTIONS**
* Have I discussed the desire for career advancement and development with employees and the opportunities that exist for them?
* How can I communicate to our employees the skills required to compete for open positions? How can I better communicate the required qualifications to prospective candidates?
* How do I support employees in understanding how to plan their careers and what they need to do to advance? How do I help talented, ambitious employees remain challenged and satisfied at the University?
* Are employees ever kept in their current positions for longer than planned because no one has been identified to fill their position? If so, how can I better identify successors to job roles currently filled by employees identified as candidates for promotion?

**Employee Engagement Drivers and Self-Reflection Questions (Cont.)**

**5. Respect and Recognition:** Interact respectfully and consistently recognize good work and meaningful contributions.
**Why it’s important.** Faculty and staff who feel respected in their workplace will show respect for their work and for the organization. The University invests in creating the conditions that make work meaningful and rewarding for employees. In return, employees respect their work environment, colleagues and the reputation of the University. Organizations that make a reciprocal commitment of respect will have faculty and staff who take a personal interest in organizational objectives.
**SELF-REFLECTION QUESTIONS**
* How do I treat faculty and staff respectfully? How do I ensure respectful behaviors within the college/unit? How do I know that all groups and individuals are treated with respect and dignity?
* How can I be more supportive of employees who have personal or family matters to attend to?
* How do I give and share credit for success?
* How do I recognize faculty and staff, either individually or as a team, for doing a good job? Is this recognition meaningful to the employees?
* How do I model inclusive behavior toward people, ideas, and ways of working?

**6. Authority and Empowerment:** Ensure that everyone has the autonomy they need to accomplish their work and the empowerment to make decisions.
**Why it’s important.** Employees with appropriate autonomy and discretion to complete their work are better enabled to be more productive and effective. By managing how they work, employees are also more likely to find ways to fully use their skills and abilities leading to more input, innovation, and increased job satisfaction.
**SELF-REFLECTION QUESTIONS**
* What do I do to create an environment that welcomes new ideas and recognizes the sharing of ideas?
* Examine the structure and accountabilities around different types of decisions. Do employees understand what decisions they can and cannot control? Do employees understand the rationale behind the delegation of decisions?
* Am I making the majority of the decisions for my college/units? How can I drive the decision-making down into lower levels within the organization?
* Do I involve employees in changes that impact them?
* Do I delegate challenging work and give employees the authority to complete the work?

**Employee Engagement Drivers and Self-Reflection Questions (Cont.)**

**7. Clear Expectations and Feedback:** Define roles, responsibilities, and performance expectations and provide regular feedback.
**Why it’s important.** Communicating expectations and giving feedback are two of the most important parts of a leader’s job. All employees need ongoing feedback on expectations and performance in order to continuously deliver high quality services. Leaders who do this successfully improve the chances of high productivity and quality work for individuals, college/units, departments, and the University overall. Clarity regarding goals and priorities enables excellent performance by allowing employees to focus their efforts on essential tasks. Likewise, by continually raising the bar, ongoing monitoring and feedback regarding performance helps ensure that faculty and staff capabilities are optimally developed and used.
**SELF-REFLECTION QUESTIONS**
* How do I identify and reward excellent performance?
* How often do I discuss performance expectations with and give feedback to faculty and staff? Do I do this on a regular and informal basis as opposed to a formal, annual event?
* What kind of feedback do I give to employees and how often is it given? How do I know if it is effective?
* How do I know my feedback is fair, timely, and specific? Do I give positive feedback when employees do well, and corrective feedback when employees need improvement?
* How do I determine if an employee is meeting performance expectations? Do I rely on objective performance goals? Do I seek feedback from those who work most closely with the employee?

**8. Collaboration:** Expect and support cooperation and the sharing of ideas within and across the organization.
**Why it’s important.** Good cooperation and teamwork helps units develop better ways to get work done and react faster to changing needs. Collaboration can also lead to better cross-unit work within an industry/discipline and is an important skill for leaders and college/units. One way successful organizations meet and exceed their goals is by optimizing cooperation across college/units that rely on each other.
**SELF-REFLECTION QUESTIONS**
* How do I share information and keep both my group and other groups informed?
* How do I assign and coordinate roles to encourage collaboration?
* How do I promote the benefits of working collaboratively with other groups?
* Have I set specific team goals? How are goals communicated? How do I know college/unit goals are clear to all team members? How do I communicate results expected of team members? Are there any consequences for not meeting team objectives?
* How do I ensure employees know how they should collaborate with others in the context of their day-to-day jobs?

---

**Employee Engagement Drivers and Self-Reflection Questions (Cont.)**

**9. Support and Resources:** Ensure everyone has the skills, training, information, and resources needed to succeed.
**Why it’s important.** Engaged employees who have the knowledge and resources to perform are likely to meet performance expectations and perform optimally. Employees can only perform at optimal levels if they have the necessary information, training, and resources (e.g., tools, technology, equipment, and supplies) required to do their jobs effectively. Employees require on-going training and development to effectively handle the changing nature of job expectations and work environments. Well-trained employees are more likely to have and use higher levels of skill in their jobs. They are also more likely to demonstrate enthusiasm and positive attitudes towards their work, and exhibit higher levels of commitment to the organization. In assessing the training and development needs within your area, take into consideration the skills employees need to help the organization achieve its objectives.
**SELF-REFLECTION QUESTIONS**
* What equipment, tools, supplies, and materials do employees say they need in order to help them do their jobs more effectively? How do I provide this for them?
* What skills are critical to the success of the college/unit both now and into the future? Do faculty and staff lack any of these critical skills? If yes, what resources are available to address needs?
* How do I make use of training and development programs–both internal and external–that employees have completed? What gaps exist between the skills valued and the skills in which employees are trained?
* How long does it take new employees to reach an acceptable level of productivity? How can this time be shortened?
* How do I include other avenues of learning such as mentors, self-directed options, cross-training, stretch projects, or skill development?

**10. Work, Structure, and Process:** Actively manage workload so that it is distributed equitably, aligns with goals and priorities, and allows for improvements in the way work is done.
**Why it’s important.** We continue to be challenged to do more work with fewer resources. Operating efficiently not only ensures a productive workforce, but that our work environments run effectively, increase motivation, and decrease frustration among faculty and staff. Employees closest to the work being performed often have the best ideas on how to improve work performance. Universities are increasingly competing for resources as well as faculty and staff effort and cannot afford to lose productivity due to inefficient processes. Tapping into employee feedback will have a positive impact on operating efficiencies, service, and employee satisfaction.
**SELF-REFLECTION QUESTIONS**
* How well do I manage the current workload? Do I over-assign work to top performers and under-assign work to lower performers? How can I invite faculty and staff input on work assignment practices?
* How can the workflow be better organized to help employees get their jobs done more effectively? How might the way work is currently done be changed to improve performance?
* What do employees feel are the greatest barriers to performing their jobs? To what extent are these factors under my control? How do I explore these issues with employees?
* What do employees find most challenging or fulfilling? What do they find most frustrating or unfulfilling?

**A Quick Guide to Planning New Employee Onboarding**

Onboarding new employees involves creating a plan and then putting it into action.

**Creating a Plan**

**WHAT IS AN ONBOARDING PLAN?**
After an employee accepts the job and prior to them starting, create a plan to transition them into the role and onto the team. An onboarding plan needs to be built for the specific level and position of the new employee and reflect the unique work environment of the department/college/unit.

**WHY CREATE A PLAN?**
While a well-thought out onboarding plan is critical for employee success and engagement, the first day is crucial. It is the moment of truth for employees to form their first impression. A good onboarding plan quickly engages a new employee in the work of the department, college, or unit and:
* Shortens the time it takes a new employee to start performing successfully and contributing to their department, college, or unit;
* Helps a new employee quickly learn how to use their skills, knowledge, and expertise in their role and how to effectively work with their colleagues;
* Demonstrates that your department, college, or unit is well-run and values their employees by being prepared for them when they start;
* Significantly reduces the chances that a newly hired employee will leave shortly after they start or be unable to perform their job.

**WHAT AMOUNT OF TIME SHOULD THE PLAN COVER?**
Onboarding timing depends on the function of the job which varies based on job level, breadth of the role, experience level of employee, and familiarity with the organization. A common time frame is a 30-60-90 day onboarding plan. This framework is useful, but only as long as it is aligned with the goal of the onboarding process, which is to help the employee become a fully functioning member of the team or department. Rather than focusing on the specific start/stop times of the onboarding elements, focus on moving employees through onboarding at a speed that allows them to be successful.

**WHO IS INVOLVED IN THE ONBOARDING PLAN?**
**The supervisor:** The supervisor of the new employee evaluates the primary role. Some departments/colleges/units have formal onboarding plans while others do not. As a supervisor of a new employee, it is important to connect with your local HR team to coordinate and find out about the available tools, resources, and guidance that they can provide. It is good practice to check in with them before the new employee arrives.

---

**Planning New Employee Onboarding (Cont.)**

**The team:** The new employee’s team also plays a vital role in the onboarding process. Your goal as a supervisor is to build an effective team* by clarifying the new employee’s role on the team and enlisting their collective help in contributing to the success of the new employee. Discuss and find ways the team can welcome the new employee.
For example, ask one team member to act as the designated go-to person when the new employee encounters problems or has questions. As you create the plan, keep in mind who may/may not actually be in the office the day the employee starts. Is anyone scheduled for long vacation? Or out on a leave?

**The new employee:** Onboarding is a two-way street. The new employee should take responsibility for learning the details of their role and begin to perform their job duties. In addition, they should be encouraged to ask questions to learn about their role, co-workers, organizational culture and leverage their strengths.**

**What should be included in the onboarding plan?**
**Elements of an onboarding plan:** COMMUNICATION, RESOURCES, COMPLIANCE, CULTURE, EXPECTATIONS, RELATIONSHIPS.

**HOW DO I PERSONALIZE THE PLAN FOR THE NEW EMPLOYEE***?**
There are key elements in every onboarding plan: communication, resources, compliance, culture, expectations, and relationships. Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, tailor the plan to the new employee based on:
**Their level of experience:**
* Are they new to this type of work? Determine what skills they need to develop or what professional development they will need.
* Are they an experienced professional? Could they take on advanced projects? The development that they need will be more advanced. How might they be a mentor for the rest of the team?
**Their role:**
* Is the new employee an individual contributor? Supervisor/Manager? Faculty? Executive?
* Who are the people they’ll interact with and how should they be connected? (i.e., direct reports, colleagues, students, stakeholders, committees, alumni groups, etc.).

* For more information on building an effective team, see **Module 4: Leading Teams on supervising.umn.edu**.
** Share the **Conversation Guide for New Employees** to give them ownership in discovering their new organization and role.
*** Use the Onboarding Worksheet to create your own plan: **z.umn.edu/onboardwksheet**.

---

**Planning New Employee Onboarding (Cont.)**

**HOW DO I PERSONALIZE THE PLAN FOR THE NEW EMPLOYEE? CONT.**
**The familiarity with the University:**
* Is the employee new to the University? Have they previously worked here? Were they a student? Or a transfer from within? Tailor their onboarding plan accordingly:
    * If they are brand new to the University, discuss the University structure, how your department/college/unit fits into the bigger picture, branding, professional groups within the University community, etc.
    * If they are already familiar with the University, discuss which communities of practice they are involved with, what they find helpful, how they would like to contribute (i.e. facilitating/presenting/mentoring).
* Put yourself in their shoes and meet them where they are. Don’t make assumptions because they came from within the University. What do they need to know now?

**ONBOARDING PLAN ELEMENTS**

**1. Communication**
**Once the job offer is accepted,** keep in contact with the employee to build excitement for their arrival. This will send a welcoming message and instill confidence about them joining the team.
**Before the first day,** send a welcome information packet/email. Provide information such as parking, hours, location, directions, dress code, etc. Examples of what to send: a welcome card that everyone on the team signs, a welcome email with links to connect them to information about their role, the team, working for your department/college/unit, etc.

**2. Resources**
Consider what the new employee needs in order to be productive as quickly as possible. This may include a computer, phone, building access, desk, work area, equipment, special instructions, etc. Make sure this is all requested with enough lead time so it is ready when the new employee arrives on day one. Check with your local HR team for additional details.

**3. Compliance**
A new employee needs to be aware of the policies and procedures required for their job. Take time to map out which policies, procedures, or safety guidelines they need to know and by when. To determine this, consult the policy library at **policy.umn.edu** or your local HR team. If possible, spread this information out over a period of time rather than have it all completed on day one.

**4. Culture***
Culture is the shared assumptions, values, and beliefs that determine how the people within a particular organization perceive, think about, and react to each other and events.
**Within the first few weeks** of a new employee’s experience in your organization, you’ll want to focus on discussing and helping the new employee learn your organization’s culture and norms and how to navigate relationships. For the first few weeks, this is more important than learning the job itself and is crucial to their success. Examples include:
* University/college/unit strategic priorities and discussing how their job/strengths can contribute.
* Jargon/acronyms
* History of the department/college/unit.
**Tease out assumptions like:**
* Meeting norms and behaviors
* Office space norms
* Lunch
* Dress code
* Joking.

* See the **Quick Guide to Organizational Culture and Onboarding** for more information.

**5. Expectations**
It is important to clarify expectations about the new employee’s role, performance expectations, how to work with you and the team, and developmental opportunities right away.
Start by reviewing the job description to determine a new employee's performance goals and how they will achieve those goals.
**Establish regular check-in conversations** as part of an effective performance management* process.

* See **Module 2: Managing and Evaluating Performance** for more information.

**Planning New Employee Onboarding (Cont.)**

**6. Relationships**
For an employee to feel connected, they need to establish vital interpersonal relationships and networks. As a supervisor, think about **key partners** (those outside the immediate team or department) that the new employee needs to know or may need to work with (frequently or not) to be successful in their role. Once these connections are identified, provide introductions via email or in-person. To avoid overwhelming a new employee, you might start with three people, and facilitate introductions between them and the new employee. When making introductions, be sure to include:
* Who the person is
* What their role is
* How they can help the new employee
* How the person and the employee will be interacting.
* **Example:** “This is Bob and he has this ROLE and TASK. You will probably work with him/need to reach out to him, when you need to do TASK.”
Along with making the introductions with others, it is important for you to foster relationships between you, the new employee, and the team as a whole. From the start, establish regular **ongoing check-in conversations** with the new employee.

**Try it! Use the Onboarding Worksheet to create your own plan: z.umn.edu/onboardwksheet.**

**Onboarding Worksheet**

**Creating a Plan**
In the space below create a detailed action plan for each of the onboarding elements.

**TAILORING THE PLAN**
Tailor the plan based on:
* [ ] **The level of experience** (Are they new to this type of work? An experienced professional?)
______________________________________________________________________
* [ ] **The role** (Is it a supervisory role? Individual contributor? Faculty? Executive?)
______________________________________________________________________
* [ ] **The familiarity with the University** (Is the employee new to the University? Previously worked here? Was a student here? Transitioning from another role at the University?)
______________________________________________________________________

**Onboarding Worksheet**

**TIMING**
Completing all of the onboarding elements is important; however, they do not necessarily need to all be completed at once - or even on the first day. The following table outlines considerations for the sequence and timeline of the elements, who is responsible, and indicates the frequency of each element.

**Communication:**
*Stay in touch with the employee between the job offer acceptance and their start date. Before the first day, send a welcome packet/email.*

**Action Plan/Reflection Questions (What needs to be done? What does the new employee need to know?) | Roles (Who does this?) | Timing (When?)**
What is essential for the new employee to know about their role on day one? Provide information such as:
* [ ] Parking and transportation | Ideally: Supervisor | Before the first day
* [ ] Building location and directions | Ideally: Supervisor | Before the first day
* [ ] Work hours | Ideally: Supervisor | Before the first day
* [ ] Dress code | Ideally: Supervisor | Before the first day
* [ ] What is needed to complete required paperwork (e.g., I-9)? Remind them to bring on their first day. | Ideally: Supervisor | Before the first day

**A Quick Guide to Organizational Culture and Onboarding**

Organizational culture is defined by the shared assumptions, values, and beliefs that determine how the people within a particular organization perceive, think about, and react to each other and events.
Departments, colleges, and units at the University all have their own unique culture that is shaped by the function, the way people go about their work, and perceptions of where their department, college, or unit. Learning about the culture within the first few weeks is often more important than learning about the job itself.

**Why should I connect new employees to culture?**
When it comes to learning about the organizational culture, an effective onboarding process is two fold:
* it helps new employees learn the organizational culture and recognize the behaviors and outcomes that are rewarded and valued; and
* it is about the organization leveraging the new employee’s strengths.
By understanding the organizational culture, employees:
* recognize the unwritten rules and the truth about how things work in their department/college/unit; this does not mean that a new employee must conform to the culture within their organization, however having this knowledge will help them become more effective;
* learn both the positive and the challenging aspects of organization’s culture;
* become productive and engaged, and are less likely to leave within the first few months.

**AVOID**
* Letting employees “run into” organizational culture.
* Testing new employees by asking them to handle situations without any guidance about the culture.
* Falling into the trap of a culture conversation that is disigenuine and consists of: corporate speak, lofty mission and vision statements, strategic plans, or focus only on the positive/aspirational aspects of the culture.
This does not actually help new employees understand how things work and how to be successful and may only set them up for frustration later.

---

**Organizational Culture and Onboarding (Cont.)**

**01 How do I get started?**
Use the following question to reflect on your department/college/unit:
**What do people pay attention to?**
* Who are your stakeholders? (i.e. donors, the public, students, internal/external clients, faculty, department chairs, deans, etc.)
* Whose opinion matters the most?
* What does success look like?
**How do people respond when something goes wrong?**
* How do leaders tend to react?
* Are the responses reactive or proactive?
* How is feedback (positive or negative) delivered?
**How are resources (funding and opportunities) allocated* within your department/college/unit?**
* What does this look like in your area?
* What does a new employee need to know?
* How are you connected to this?
* Refer to **Our Budget** website at **twin-cities.umn.edu/our-budget** for a quick overview. This would be particularly useful for employees coming from outside the higher education industry.
**How is behavior modeled?**
* Who are the most respected leaders (formal and informal)?
* How do leaders demonstrate ethical behaviors?
* What advice do people give for success?
**In what ways does your organization recognize employee contributions (i.e. rewards, status, etc.)**
* How are staff and faculty recognized for doing a good job?
* What advancement opportunities are there?

---

**Organizational Culture and Onboarding (Cont.)**

**02** The self-reflection questions will help you assess where your department, college or unit falls within each of the seven common characteristics of organizational culture:*
1. **Innovation and risk-taking:** how much are employees encouraged to take risks?
2. **Attention to detail:** how much are employees expected to be precise and pay attention to detail?
3. **Outcome orientation:** how much is the focus on results (the “what” of performance) and how much is on the process used (the “how” of performance)?
4. **People orientation:** how much do people consider the effect that actions and decisions will have on people in the organization?
5. **Team orientation:** how much is work organized around teams versus individuals?
6. **Competitiveness:** how competitive and confrontational are people?
7. **Stability:** how much emphasis is on the status quo versus growth?
Consider where your department, college, or unit falls on each of the seven characteristics of organizational culture. Make sure to share real-life examples that bring the culture to life within your organization. For example, when talking about Innovation and Risk Taking, think of a time when someone took a risk and describe what happened. Was it encouraged/appreciated?

**03** Once you have assessed your organizational culture, **share and discuss it with the new employee.** You can start by going over a few characteristics at a time.
Additionally, take a look at the **Conversation Guide for New Employee**,** which outlines more conversation topics and ideas along with the suggested timelines to ensure the smooth transition of the employee into your team. This guide is intended for your new employee.

** Refer to **Conversation Guide for New Employees** at **https://z.umn.edu/SDC_M6_NewEmployeeConversationGuide** for additional ideas on conversation topics during a new employee’s first year.

**30 to 60 Days**
During the first 60 days, most employees are performing their new functions somewhat independently and there are still a lot of new experiences to be had, depending on the job. Many people are still in the process of understanding the broader context of the University and the culture of the group/unit. Use this period to continue to meet people, especially those in other units that might be impacted by the work of your unit. Build your network and understand how you can contribute to your college’s strategic goals or those of the University. Consider the questions below as you continue to learn.

**Ask yourself:**

**60 to 90 Days**
The third month of a new job is a time to clarify expectations with your supervisor and set goals for the rest of the year. It’s also a good time to consider having a mini-review to discuss how your knowledge, skills, and abilities are fitting within your team and what you can do to make an impact on the strategic goals. It’s also a good time to determine additional training and professional development that might be useful. Consider the questions below as a guide to these conversations.

**A Conversation Guide for New Employees (Cont.)**

**90 Days and Beyond**
Congratulations! You are now past the first three months of your new job. This is a time when many employees are flying solo on the job. You might find your supervisor are sending you to meetings alone, assigning tasks, and establishing a regular routine of check-ins and feedback. This is when you will probably start to feel like you know the scope of your job and can accomplish routine work with little supervision. During this time period, think about long term contributions to the unit and connect it with the University’s mission.

**Ask yourself:**
* When did I stop feeling new?
* What tasks still make me feel new and do I know who to contact for support?
* How can I become more involved in the University as an employee?
* Do I have a good relationship with my supervisor and my peers? How can I improve it?
* What do I want to accomplish before the end of the year? How can I do that?
* What efficiencies or changes might make my job better? Have I discussed these with my supervisor?
* Am I contributing to conversations at team meetings? Am I making suggestions that are relevant and impactful?
* How am I representing my organization to other people at the University? What can I do to improve that?

**Ask your supervisor:**
* What are our unit’s challenges and how can I help?
* Agree on goals for the rest of the year and what you want to accomplish.

**Ask your peers:**
* How can I better support our team?
* What is one thing you would like to change about our work?
* Which part of our work gives you pride?

**RECOMMENDED TO DOS**
* Attend a Gopher athletic event or visit a University museum.
* Review your job description and make sure you are engaging in all of the responsibilities. Seek clarification if needed.
* Identify three ways you can be more efficient or support your team better. Add them to your work plan.
* Subscribe to the governing committee minutes (like Faculty Senate, Civil Service Committee, etc.) to stay informed of current issues for the University.
* Look for opportunities to mentor, help, or support new members of your team/unit.
* Continue to meet with your supervisor regularly - at least one time per month.

**A Quick Guide to Analyzing the Needs of the Position**

When in the process of selection and hiring, taking a step back to analyze the needs of the position is an opportunity for a refreshed, clear view of how the open position can support your department or unit. It will also help you increase your chances of finding someone who can contribute to your department’s needs and priorities and will result in increased effectiveness for you, your hire, and your department.

**How do I get started?**
Analyze the open position and think about exactly WHY you are looking for a new hire. Follow the steps which outline the best practices below:

**01 CONNECT TO BROADER PRIORITIES**
**Identify how the position contributes to the broader priorities of your department or unit:**
* What are the broader priorities of your department?
* What impact do you need this position to make on these priorities?
* What will happen if the position does not support these priorities?
Make sure to consider the departmental changes that have occurred.

**02 CONSIDER AND ADJUST RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE POSITION**
**Create goals for the position based on the broader priorities of your department or unit:** take some time to think about WHAT you are looking for and WHY.
**Think ahead. Anticipate future needs of the position:**
* What are the goals for the next year? Next three years?
* What results are expected of the position and how are they connected with broader priorities?
* What are the key goals? What are the specific objectives or deliverables?
**Describe what success will look like:**
* How will you know if the candidate is successful? In the first 6 months? The first year? The first three years?
* What measures/metrics will demonstrate success in this position?
* What changes or improvements will result if the candidate is successful?
Though it might be tempting to rely on older versions of the position description to save time, avoid doing this. Older descriptions don’t account for changes to the work and can create confusion about job responsibilities.

**03 DETERMINE SKILLS, KNOWLEDGE AND ABILITIES NEEDED**
Behavioral competencies are the skills, knowledge, abilities, and other characteristics needed for success in a particular role. They describe expectations for how results are achieved and include technical, leadership, and interpersonal factors.
**Technical competencies** are specific to the job, discipline, or functional area, e.g., financial analysis, programming, design, etc. **Leadership competencies** describe how you work with others to achieve results.

---

**Analyzing the Needs of the Position (Cont.)**

**03 DETERMINE SKILLS, KNOWLEDGE AND ABILITIES NEEDED (CONT.)**
In addition to technical skills, identify the specific leadership competencies and describe them so that they are measurable and job related. What is it exactly that you are looking for? For example, a concept like collaboration is difficult to measure. Measuring the collaboration behaviors is a more effective approach. Compare:
**Vague, subjective:** “I want someone who is a good collaborator”
**Measurable, behavior-based:** “Maintains productive relationships with others even when faced with conflict” “Listens respectfully and openly to others regardless of level, position, or background”
A behavioral competency model* is a good place to start when determining which competencies and behaviors are needed for a position.
*Need a behavioral competency model? Go to **z.umn.edu/competencies** to learn more about the competency model developed at the University of Minnesota.

**04 PRIORITIZE SKILLS, KNOWLEDGE AND ABILITIES**
* Which skills, knowledge and abilities are most critical for the position?
* What do you need the person to be able to do on day one? What skills are important, but can be developed on the job?
When prioritizing critical skills, make sure to balance short term and long term needs of the department. What skills would be valuable in the long run?

**Design for inclusion**
1. Could someone succeed in the position if they didn’t have one of the required qualifications? If the answer is “yes”, then the qualification is not actually required - consider moving it to the “preferred” list:
* **Limiting:** “Masters Degree” “Proficient in Canvas”
* **More inclusive:** “Bachelor’s degree and two years of experience” “Proficient in Learning Management Systems“
2. Describe the minimum qualifications intentionally to open it up to more applicants. Fewer people will apply if they don’t meet ALL of the qualifications. Consider the following examples:
* 5 years experience in project management (limited)
* 3-5 years experience in project management (more flexible)
* Experience in project management (more inclusive and still gets at this qualification).

**Next Steps**
Once you have analyzed the position, you can put those ideas into the job description to ensure you are communicating what you are looking for and attracting candidates who can meet your department’s current and future needs.
For specific guidelines to writing the position description see the **Writing a Position Description** handout available at **z.umn.edu/writingpositiondescription**

A behavioral competency model* is a good place to start when determining which competencies. Feel free to use the **University of Minnesota’s Leadership Challenges** model for additional information.

**Step 4. Prioritize Skills, Knowledge and Abilities**
Answer the following questions:
* Which skills, knowledge and abilities are most critical for the position?
* What do you need the person to be able to do on day one?
* What skills are important, but can be developed on the job?

**A Quick Guide to Preparing for an Interview**

Preparing for an interview helps you avoid leaning on your impressions of a candidate, which is commonly known as a “gut decision.” An objective and thorough interview process can help you make a solid hiring decision, which will help decrease unwanted turnover, improve engagement in department priorities and save time and money in the long run.
Applying the following best practices in the interview process will ensure an objective, unbiased interview process and reduce the influence of subjective (and often wrong) “gut decisions.”

**01 SELECT A HIRING TEAM/COMMITTEE**
* Interviews are most effective when conducted 1:1. The larger the interview team, the more risk there is of an unstructured process - one interviewer might dominate the questioning, while other might be hesitant to raise critical questions, concerns or objections to this dominant view. There is also a higher risk of not asking the same questions or all of the questions of a candidate.
* If you decide to have a team of interviewers (or committee), consider selecting interviewers who bring diverse perspectives to the assessment process. For example, an interview with a hiring manager, a future team member, and a key partner would bring in more insights into assessing the match between job requirements and candidate competencies.

**02 EDUCATE ABOUT THE PROCESS**
The most important responsibility a hiring manager has to their hiring team is to talk beforehand about expectations for the interview process. Some important discussion points are:
* **Position Requirements and Selection Criteria.** Review the minimum and preferred qualifications with the hiring team. Remind them that anyone who meets the minimum qualifications should be carefully considered.
* **Interview Procedure.** Standardized interviews are the most effective approach (see *Establish the Interview procedure* below). Standardize not only the order of the questions, but also who will ask which questions.
* **Overall Timeline.** Plan out the timing and logistics.
* **Ways to Reduce Bias:**
    * Make them aware of the risk of a “gut decision” which takes root in the interview process. A gut reaction to a candidate can be a symptom of a hidden bias.
    * Encourage the hiring team to refrain from discussing the candidates until all interviews are officially done. This can lead to false assumptions or biased judgments about candidates.

**Watch out for: “gut decision”**
* Assessing identical resumes differently based on the name of the individual.
* Applying objective requirements more rigorously to candidates from underrepresented groups, and more loosely to those from the dominant culture.
* Applying the “halo effect” to one group (one strength generalized into an overall positive rating) or the “horns effect” to another group (one weakness generalized into an overall negative rating).
* Eliminating an otherwise qualified candidate because s/he is “just not the right fit.”
* Evaluating some candidates on what they have accomplished, while evaluating other candidates evaluated based on their potential to do the job.
Challenge yourself to go through this list when preparing to screen or interview the candidates to avoid bias and improve inclusivity in your hiring process.

**Preparing for an Interview (Cont.)**

**03 SELECT AN APPROPRIATE ASSESSMENT METHOD**
Depending on the level of the job you are hiring for other assessment tools (e.g., personality assessments, cognitive ability testing, work simulations) may be more useful than others. Whatever the position, quality assessment requires a clear idea of the knowledge, skills, and abilities required in the position.
The interview is the most commonly used tool. A **structured interview** is considered the most valid interviewing tool and helps to avoid bias in the process.
While **unstructured interviews** are tempting, they often lack validity and can at best provide a glimpse at candidate’s personality and interpersonal skills.
Structured interviews are the best way to get valid, predictive, objective responses from candidates.

**Structured Interviews:**
* Have high validity
* Assess personality and interpersonal skills
* Questions are predictive of job performance
* Ask same questions for each candidate
* Require candidate’s to give specific examples of work behaviors
* Allow candidate responses to be evaluated objectively
* Require questions based on a clear understanding of job needs

**04 DESIGN EFFECTIVE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS**
**Behavioral interview questions** ensure accurate assessments by giving the candidate a chance to give concrete examples of how they handled specific situations, avoiding speculation or guess work. Behavioral questions:
* **Assess key behaviors that will be necessary to perform the job well.** Refer to the required competencies - knowledge, skills, and abilities of the position to pinpoint which behavioral questions would be most useful.
* **Don’t imply a “correct” answer.** They reveal a candidate’s approach to their work and interactions with coworkers.
* **Call for real examples of past behaviors.** If you find a candidate doesn’t answer a question specifically, find a way to ask the question again or give them another chance to provide an answer. Your goal is to get a concrete answer.

**Sample behavioral questions**
* “Describe a situation where your work was criticized. How did you react?”
* “What is the biggest error in judgment or failure you have made in a previous job? Why did you make it? How did you correct the problem?”
* “Describe an experience you had interacting with someone that had a different background than your own. What was the situation? What were the results?”

Refer to the **Interview Guide** for more information and examples of behavioral questions as they align with key leadership competencies.

**Preparing for an Interview (Cont.)**

**05 ESTABLISH AN INTERVIEW PROCEDURE**
Interviews are the most effective when they follow the same procedure. This approach minimizes inconsistencies among different interviews, which will reduce bias in the process. Not following the procedure may impact a candidate’s responses either for or against their candidacy.
A sample standard procedure includes:
1. **Introduction.** Introduce candidate to hiring team members and give an overview of the department
2. **Job overview.** Give candidate a realistic job preview - a candid and complete picture of what it would be like to be in the job - not overly positive or overly negative.
3. **Interview Questions** (in order)
* Q1
* Q2
* Q3
* Q4
4. **Opportunity for questions from the candidate.**
5. **Wrap-up and next steps.** Opportunity to educate about the timeline, when the candidate should expect to hear back.

---

**Interview Guide**

Every candidate has a unique set of knowledge, skills and abilities, also known as behavioral competencies. Every position requires a specific set of these behavioral competencies. An effective interview allows you to match the candidate’s skill set with the behavioral competencies that the position needs. To assess candidates’ skill sets for positions in your department or unit, follow the steps outlined below:

**Step 1. Start with competencies**
In addition to **technical competencies** (job-specific, e.g. financial analysis, programming, design, etc.) there are **leadership competencies** that describe HOW one works with others to achieve results. It is often these leadership competencies that separate the best candidates from everyone else, even in many technical roles. From the list below, select the 2-3 most critical competencies for the job.
* [ ] Demonstrates an open mind
* [ ] Increases access, diversity, and inclusion
* [ ] Innovates
* [ ] Drives efficiency
* [ ] Thinks strategically
* [ ] Aligns resources
* [ ] Selects and develops talent
* [ ] Motivates and inspires others
* [ ] Builds relationships
* [ ] Is resilient and courageous
* [ ] Operates with integrity
* [ ] Learns and adapts

See **z.umn.edu/competencies** for more information about behavioral competencies at the U of M

**Step 2. Select the right questions**
Each competency has a set of behavior-based questions. These questions assess key behaviors that are necessary to perform the job well. They do not imply a “correct” answer, instead they provide the candidate an opportunity to give concrete examples of how they have handled specific situations: outlining the **situation** that occurred, the **actions** they took, and the **impact** their actions had. Many of the questions get at information relevant for more than one competency.

**Step 3: Take notes**
Relying on notes helps to ensure the final decision is made based on evidence, not assumptions. It is a good practice to start with your notes and avoid discussing candidates until ALL interviews are done. Not doing so can lead to assumptions or biased judgments. When interviewing, take notes on:
* **Situation:** The context in which the behavior or action took place.
* **Behavior:** What the candidate actually did in the situation.
* **Impact:** What was accomplished or learned as a result of the candidate’s actions or behaviors.

---

**Interview Guide (Cont.)**

**Note:** Remember to **include follow-up questions** to get a clear picture of the candidate’s experiences, actions, reasoning, and results. If you find a candidate doesn’t answer a question specifically, ask the question again or find a way to give them another chance to provide an answer.

**Step 4: Evaluate the responses**
Evaluate the responses using a standard rating scale. Using a standard rating scale that ALL interviewers are using gives you an opportunity to lead with the data in the post interview discussion rather than leading with subjective reactions. An example of a scale is:

* **Significant Gap:** Fails to demonstrate competency regardless of guidance provided. No good examples.
* **Below Requirements:** Demonstrates competency inconsistently, even with repeated instruction or guidance. Few good examples.
* **Meets Requirements:** Demonstrates competency accurately and consistently on familiar procedures and needs supervisor guidance for new skills. Some good examples.
* **Exceeds Requirements:** Demonstrates competency accurately and consistently in most situations with minimal guidance. Many good
* **Far Exceeds Requirements:** Perfect answer. Demonstrates competency accurately, consistently, and independently. All points relevant. All good examples.

**A Quick Guide to Making a Hiring Decision**

When hiring don’t be tempted to rush the final decision. This may save time in the short term, but can lead to problems later if you end up hiring the wrong person. A sense of being rushed can lead to making a decision without fully considering the candidate’s development needs or not allotting time to address concerns that the hiring team has about the candidate.
The costs of hiring the wrong person outweigh the costs of a failed search. Poor performance and an inability to be successful in the position are the main risks of a rushed hiring decision, but other results can include unwanted turnover, disengagement, decreased morale among employees, or unanticipated coaching needs. Review the steps below to learn about the best practices to make a successful hiring decision:

**01 START WITH THE DATA**
Review all relevant data points:
* **Position Description.** Revisit the goals, responsibilities and expectations of the position. What are the key responsibilities? Are they all weighted equally?
* **Interview Notes.** When using a rubric or other quantitative tool to assess the candidate’s skills, start by tallying up the ratings and comparing the totals. For each candidate, review the notes from the interview. Did the candidates answer the questions in a way that allowed you to fully assess their actions and the outcomes of a particular situation?

**02 ASSESS CANDIDATE SKILL SETS NEEDED TO SUCCESSFULLY PERFORM THE JOB**
For each candidate, consider:
* **Current skills, knowledge and abilities.** How did their answers demonstrate the skills, knowledge and abilities needed for the position?
* **Immediate needs for feedback and coaching.** What does the candidate need to be able to do on day one? What skill level is acceptable? What is the impact of their mastering the necessary skills with time vs. early on? Does your department or unit have the time, energy, and resources to help the candidates develop?
* **Potential.** How motivated is the candidate to learn new things? When faced with challenges in their previous positions, were they able to demonstrate persistence? Did they demonstrate the ability to learn quickly?

**03 HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH YOUR HIRING TEAM**
Once all candidates are interviewed, make time to review your notes and have an open discussion about their skills, knowledge, and abilities, development needs and potential. Set the expectations that all hiring team members will be heard and different opinions are welcome.

---

**Making a Hiring Decision (Cont.)**

**03 HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH YOUR HIRING TEAM (CONT.)**

**Beware the path of least resistance:**
When hiring managers are under time pressure or when there is strong pressure for consensus, team members may not raise critical questions, concerns, or objections to the dominant view or the view of people in leadership and authority.
* **How to address?**
    * Actively seek input from all members of the team.
    * Have team members assess candidates individually and write down their thoughts before having a group discussion. Then, have each team member share their views before opening up a full group discussion.
    * Have someone on the team play a role of “devil’s advocate” or contrarian - a person whose role is to challenge the status quo and ask tough questions can help the team to avoid complacency, stay focused on accurate candidate assessment.
    * Avoid expressing your opinion as the leader until other views have been voiced.

**04 EXAMINE YOUR BIASES**
Biases can creep in at every point in the hiring process. To avoid biases and find the best person for the job, make sure to:
* Discuss candidate’s potential performance based on evidence from the interview, not assumptions or “feelings” about their behaviors
* Be consistent! Don’t insist on some characteristics (modesty, likeability, humility, etc.) from some candidates but not others
* Don’t count “gaps in a resume” against a candidate without a good reason for doing so
* Don’t make assumptions about what candidates need based on information you have about them that is not relevant to the job
* Don’t fall into “affinity bias” - or preferring someone because you went to the same college or they remind you of someone you know and like
* Give everyone- or no one- the benefit of the doubt. If you find yourself making a concession for a candidate, such as not being concerned about any gaps in their resume, make sure you are making this same concession for ALL candidates.

**Making a Hiring Decision (Cont.)**

**05 MAKE A HIRING DECISION**
There are three possible situations when making the final hiring decision:
**1. One candidate rises to the top.** This is the ideal outcome but is infrequent. If this happens, make sure it isn’t due to time pressure or pressure for consensus.
**2. No candidate rises to the top.** This situation requires a careful review of the job posting and interview data to reconsider current candidates’ qualifications. You may also need to go back to the job requirements and re-evaluate them to see how they could be adjusted to widen the candidate pool.
**3. Several people rise to the top.** This is the most common situation hiring managers find themselves in. All the work you have done so far in the process will pay off now. Using your interview data, consider the following questions for each candidate:
* How do they connect to the position needs?
* How can they contribute instead of just fitting in?
* What skills do they bring? What are their developmental needs? Do you as the supervisor have the time and energy to help them develop?
* What biases do you have about the candidate?
* What other information needs to be considered?
* Have you talked through your decision with a trusted colleague?

**06 FOLLOW UP**
**Communicate** clearly with all candidates in a timely manner. It’s important to make candidates feel that their time and commitment were valued, so make sure they hear back from you after an interview or application. They are likely to share their experience with their professional and personal networks, so it’s important for it to be positive and generate excitement about the possibility of working at the University of Minnesota.
**Coordinate** with your local human resources team to find out what selection and hiring processes your department or unit already has in place (offer letter, EOAA goals, etc.).
**Create** an onboarding plan* for how to help your new hire become up-to-speed.

Refer to the **Onboarding New Employees** module on **supervising.umn.edu** for more information and resources on planning new employee onboarding.

Biases can creep in at every point in the hiring process. To avoid biases and find the best person for the job, make sure to:
*   Discuss candidate’s potential performance based on evidence from the interview, not assumptions or “feelings” about their behaviors
*   Be consistent! Don’t insist on some characteristics (modesty, likeability, humility, etc.) from some candidates but not others
*   Don’t count “gaps in a resume” against a candidate without a good reason for doing so
*   Don’t make assumptions about what candidates need based on information you have about them that is not relevant to the job
*   Don’t fall into “affinity bias” - or preferring someone because you went to the same college or they remind you of someone you know and like
*   Give everyone- or no one- the benefit of the doubt. If you find yourself making a concession for a candidate, such as not being concerned about any gaps in their resume, make sure you are making this same concession for ALL candidates.

**Making a Hiring Decision (Cont.)**

**05 MAKE A HIRING DECISION**
There are three possible situations when making the final hiring decision:
1.  **One candidate rises to the top.** This is the ideal outcome but is infrequent. If this happens, make sure it isn’t due to time pressure or pressure for consensus.
2.  **No candidate rises to the top.** This situation requires a careful review of the job posting and interview data to reconsider current candidates’ qualifications. You may also need to go back to the job requirements and re-evaluate them to see how they could be adjusted to widen the candidate pool.
3.  **Several people rise to the top.** This is the most common situation hiring managers find themselves in. All the work you have done so far in the process will pay off now. Using your interview data, consider the following questions for each candidate:
    *   How do they connect to the position needs?
    *   How can they contribute instead of just fitting in?
    *   What skills do they bring? What are their developmental needs? Do you as the supervisor have the time and energy to help them develop?
    *   What biases do you have about the candidate?
    *   What other information needs to be considered?
    *   Have you talked through your decision with a trusted colleague?

**06 FOLLOW UP**
**Communicate** clearly with all candidates in a timely manner. It’s important to make candidates feel that their time and commitment were valued, so make sure they hear back from you after an interview or application. They are likely to share their experience with their professional and personal networks, so it’s important for it to be positive and generate excitement about the possibility of working at the University of Minnesota.

**Coordinate** with your local human resources team to find out what selection and hiring processes your department or unit already has in place (offer letter, EOAA goals, etc.).

**Create** an onboarding plan* for how to help your new hire become up-to-speed.
