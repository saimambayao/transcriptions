**CHAPTER 1**

**The BARMM and the Transition**

**Historical Background**

Historical injustices, persistent abuses, and marginalization in Mindanao fostered mistrust and resistance among the Moro people which resulted in protracted violence in the region. Notably, the Jabidah massacre in 1968 [1] was among the many incidents that heightened Moro desire to exercise their right to self-determination and demand for independence from the Republic of the Philippines.

These incidents triggered the formation of various Muslim revolutionary groups, namely: (a) the Muslim Independence Movement (MIM) in 1968; (b) the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) under Nur Misuari in 1973; and (c) the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) under the late Ustadz Hashim Salamat in 1978.

The Government of the Philippines (GRP) engaged the MNLF and the MILF in peace processes to find political solutions to the problems and put an end to war and violence in Mindanao. The Tripoli Final Peace Agreement between the GRP and the MNLF, which called for the establishment of autonomy covering 13 provinces and nine (9) cities in Mindanao was signed on December 23, 1976. Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1618 declared the areas covered in the Tripoli Agreement as Interim Autonomous Regions headed by two (2) regional commissioners. The Office of Regional Commissioners was abolished on September 20, 1979 through PD 1639 and their powers were transferred to the *Lupong Tagapagpaganap ng Pook*.

When the Marcos regime ended through the People Power Revolution in 1986, the continuation of peace negotiations with the MNLF was among the priorities pursued by the Corazon Aquino Administration. The 1987 Philippine Constitution enshrined the creation of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) under the sponsorship of the Moro delegates to the 1986 Constitutional Commission. A bill drafted by the Regional Consultative Commission was later passed into law as Republic Act 6734 also known as the Organic Act for the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.

Peace negotiations with the MNLF were continued with the clamor to implement Phase 2 of the Tripoli Final Peace Agreement [2] which was forged during the Marcos regime. The outcome of the negotiations resulted in the signing of the 1996 Final Peace Agreement (FPA) with the MNLF during the Ramos Administration. The 1996 FPA provided for the amendment of the ARMM Organic Law and facilitated the passage of the Act to Strengthen and Expand the Organic Act for the ARMM (RA 9054).

[1] *Jabidah Massacre was a massacre of Moro Army recruits by the Armed Forces of the Philippines on 18 March 1968, which is acknowledged as major flashpoint that ignited the Moro insurgency in the Philippines. (Wikipedia)*
[2] *Phase II of the Tripoli Agreement involved the repeal of Republic Act No. 6734 through a congressional action and the subsequent submission of amendment law to the people of the affected areas via a plebiscite. This shall be done within 2 years from the establishment of Southern Philippines Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD).*

The creation and strengthening of the ARMM was intended to address the call for self-governance and bring about development in the southern part of the country. However, it was perceived that the ARMM fell short of delivering the benefits of peace to the Bangsamoro.

In October 2012, the Government of the Philippines (GPH) and the MILF signed the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro (FAB) and the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB) in March 2014. These provided for the creation of a new political entity that will replace ARMM, as well as stipulations of several transitional processes and modalities.

The enabling bill of the CAB, the proposed Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL), was submitted to and deliberated by the Philippine Congress. However, the backlash of the failed military operation against the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) during the Mamasapano incident in 2015 affected the passage of the proposed law.

In 2016, when President Rodrigo Roa Duterte assumed the presidency, the Six-Point Peace and Development Agenda were introduced to push for the implementation of standing peace agreement. The Bangsamoro Transition Commission (BTC) was also reconstituted through the issuance of Executive Order No. 8, which expanded the membership from 15 to 21 allowing more participation in the drafting of the new BBL. The new version of the enabling law, the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) bill, was submitted in July 2017 for legislation.

The Philippine Congress passed “An Act ... Providing for the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), repealing for the purpose Republic Act 6734 as amended by RA 9054” (RA 11054) or the Bangsamoro Organic Law. President Duterte signed it into law on July 27, 2018 and was ratified in a plebiscite in early 2019.

To foster genuine autonomy and moral governance, and improve fiscal management, the BOL created the BARMM as the new political entity replacing the ARMM and provided for a transition process. The ratification of the law commenced the transition period for the establishment of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

### **BARMM Profile**

The BARMM is composed of the following geographic areas covered by the previous ARMM: the five (5) provinces of Basilan, Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi; and the cities of Marawi and Lamitan. Other areas which voted “yes” during the plebiscite for the ratification of the BOL are Cotabato City and the 63 barangays in the municipalities of Aleosan, Carmen, Kabacan, Midsayap, Pigkawayan, and Pikit in the province of North Cotabato.

The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is now composed of five (5) provinces, two (2) component cities, one (1) independent city, 116 municipalities with 2,590 barangays and eight (8) congressional districts. With the inclusion of the new areas, the region has a population of 4,273,149 and a total land area of 12,711.79 square kilometers excluding the expanded areas. Figure 1.1 shows the BARMM territory, waters, and zones of joint cooperation [3] while (Table 1.1) provides the administrative divisions of the region.

### **The Transition: Its Implications to Regional Planning**

The Transition plan aims to identify the new structural framework of the BARMM, based on the provisions of the Republic Act No. 11054, also known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law, taking into consideration the existing structure, budget, and other relevant features of the ARMM.

The BOL provides for the creation of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) which serves as the interim government in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region during the transition period from 2019 to 2022. The BTA is vested with executive and legislative powers and functions of the Bangsamoro Government as provided in the Organic Law during the transition period.

One of the responsibilities of the BTA is the preparation of the transition plan to aid in the dispensation of functions and priorities of the transition government. In June 2019, the Parliament adopted the BARMM Transition Plan that defines the structure and schedule of phasing out of the offices and employees under the former ARMM, which is set to be completed in December 2019.

The BOL further stipulates the preparation of a development plan for the region. Under the leadership of the Interim Chief Minister Ahod Balawag Ebrahim, the Bangsamoro government pursued the formulation of a development plan for the Bangsamoro for the period 2020-2022 as part of its priority agenda.

### **Challenges for Regional Planning in the Transition**

One of the major challenges confronting the Bangsamoro government is the implementation of the BARMM Transition Plan that ensures the smooth transition from ARMM to BARMM within the limited period. This has caused disruption of the functioning of the bureaucracy and the continued delivery of services to people while the government is in transition.

The coming in of new entrants to the regional bureaucracy is both a challenge and opportunity in attaining the desired changes envisioned by the new Bangsamoro government. The newly hired personnel need to be capacitated and equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to meet governance requirements and expectations from the ground.

Another important provision of the BOL is the enactment of priority legislations to fully empower the BARMM in managing its affairs, which requires better coordination and collaborative efforts of the BTA officials in order to fast-track these legislations. These include ...the creation of offices defined in the transition plan, which is crucial for the effective functioning of the bureaucracy.

The abolition of the Regional Economic and Development Planning Board (REDPB) creates the urgency of a new law to establish the Bangsamoro Economic and Development Council (BEDC) and its committees. The BEDC will serve as the highest planning, coordinating, and monitoring body in the BARMM; facilitate the formulation and updating of the development plans of Bangsamoro government; and recommend these for approval and legitimation by the Parliament.

On August 9, 2019, the Interim Chief Minister issued Memorandum Order No. 449, which directed the formulation of the 1st Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP) 2020-2022 through the five (5) Planning Committees (PCs) which facilitated the formulation process. This issuance is consistent with the Memorandum Order No. 01, s. 2019, issued by the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), which directed all government entities to update the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2017-2022, Results Matrices (RM), Public Investment Programs (PIP), and the respective regional plans and programs.

The formulation of the 1st BDP 2020-2022 was guided by the BOL, BARMM Transition Plan, BARMM 12-Point Priority Agenda, BARMM Planning Guidelines, PDP Midterm Update 2017-2022, NEDA Planning Guidelines, and with harmonization of other existing development plans such as ARMM-Regional Development Plan (RDP) 2017-2022, BDP1 & BDP2 by the Bangsamoro Development Agency (BDA), Unified Bangsamoro Development Plan (UBDP), and other relevant planning documents.

**Realities in the Transition Relevant to Regional Planning**

The start of the transition process brought opportunities and challenges to the Bangsamoro. These realities were anticipated and considered in the formulation of the 1st BDP 2020-2022 to ensure that the proposed strategies and initiatives are responsive. The Plan includes proper implementation mechanisms and monitoring and evaluation.

**Poor investment programming could lead to overlapping of functions and duplications of policies, activities, programs/projects, and services (PAPS) funded by the national and Bangsamoro government.**

The transition to a new form of government carries issues and concerns plaguing the Bangsamoro region since its establishment. The lack of coordination and consultation between and among the national implementing agencies and their regional counterparts resulted in overlapping of functions and duplication of PAPS.

Weak vertical linkages among planning, investment programming, and budgeting are also a contributing factor. In most instances, despite the availability of funds, the proposed programs or projects are not ready for implementation causing delays. The ... tendency of the national government agencies to pre-identify projects without consulting their regional counterparts resulted in duplication or mismatch of projects with the priority needs of the locality. This misuse of funds results to waste of public resources which deprives other rightful Bangsamoro communities and beneficiaries.

The capacity of the incoming planning personnel of BARMM needs to be rapidly built up particularly in the following areas: a) development planning; b) investment programming, and c) ...monitoring and evaluation, among others. This is to ensure rational use and allocation of resources and proper implementation of PAPS in the Bangsamoro region. The new Bangsamoro government needs to establish and expand planning linkages with the national government, as well as with local and international partners for this purpose. The establishment and operationalization of all Intergovernmental Relation (IGR) mechanisms will serve as a vital platform in resolving issues and concerns related to the development and implementation of all programs and projects in the Bangsamoro region.

The creation of the BEDC by the Bangsamoro Parliament will also provide venue for the Bangsamoro government to strengthen their functions on development planning, investment programming, and monitoring and evaluation, among others. The BEDC will serve as the planning, coordinating, and monitoring body in the BARMM; facilitate the formulation and updating of the development plans of the Bangsamoro government; and recommend these plans for approval and legitimization by the Parliament. The BEDC will be assisted by the Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority (BPDA) as its technical secretariat. The functions of the BPDA need to be expanded to accommodate the broader planning responsibilities of the Bangsamoro government.

**Legal impediments in the turnover of Cotabato City may affect their inclusion in planning and budgeting processes.**

The possible exclusion of Cotabato City from the regional planning and budgeting processes, which is yet to be formally turned over to BARMM, may create anxiety and uncertainty among the affected constituents. Supervision and political jurisdiction over this additional area is yet to be clarified, as well as its inclusion in the identification of projects and budgeting process in the BARMM.

**Unless readiness of proposed programs and projects is ensured, the Bangsamoro Development Investment Program (BDIP) may end up being a mere wish list derailing implementation and budget utilization.**

Among the major concerns that affect development planning and project implementation in the Bangsamoro region is the non-readiness of programs/projects due to lack of preparatory activities in project development stage such as the following: a) in-depth analysis and pre-project evaluation, consultation and planning; and b) limited, if not poor technical skills in the preparation of the feasibility study (FS) by the concerned implementing agencies.

**The merging of offices and gradual phase out of ARMM employees and hiring of new personnel may impact on the capability of the Bangsamoro government to implement PAPS.**

The passage of the BOL calls for the gradual phase out of ARMM employees and hiring of new personnel to run the bureaucracy. This measure to rationalize various positions and ensure proper matching of educational qualifications with job descriptions improving effectiveness in fulfilling individual duties and organizational functions and mandates.

The reorganization and rehiring of employees may pose concerns in the bureaucracy especially when the experienced and capable personnel will be replaced by the ones not familiar with the tasks at hand. Bulk of the institutional memory may also be lost including those regarding the formulation of this BDP where newly hired staffs were not involved in the process.

The merging of offices as required by a parliamentary government will deal with similar concerns. Hence, streamlining of these agencies is necessary to simplify coordination and avoid overlapping of functions and positions. However, the merging of at least two (2) or more agencies into one ministry will result in the loss of employment for other heads of offices and some personnel. This also makes coordination more complex on the part of the merged regional ministries since they will still be dealing with two or more counterpart offices at the national level.

**Low absorptive capacity results to low level of PAPS implementation may also affect budget utilization.**

Lack of experienced personnel in the newly established Bangsamoro government may delay the implementation of PAPS. In a short period of time, the new entrants to the regional government are expected to learn the necessary technical skills and expertise on planning, investment programming, project implementation, and monitoring and evaluation.

While unspent budget of the ministries will be reverted to the General Fund of the BARMM and not to the national treasury, low funds utilization will still reflect negatively on the financial performance management of the Bangsamoro government and also affects regular services to the intended beneficiaries.

**Opportunities in the Transition**

The Unified Bangsamoro Development Plan [4] acknowledges the following opportunities inherent in the transition:

“The enactment and ratification of Republic Act (RA) 11054, otherwise known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law for the implementation of Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB), is a historical milestone in the Bangsamoro struggle for the right to self-determination (RSD). It is a concrete step towards addressing the compounded problems faced by the Bangsamoro people from decades of war and resistance. The enactment and ratification of the law gives hope to the people whose experience of a protracted peace process almost lost their confidence on the sincerity of the government and eroded trust to negotiated settlement as a means to achieve peace.

The recognition of the distinct identity of the Bangsamoro stated in Article II Section 1 and the powers enumerated in Article V Section 2 of RA 11054 are necessary to operationalize the long aspiration for self-governance. The translation of these political powers into structure and system of governance to establish a genuine self-rule can be construed as initial translation of the right to self-determination in the current context and within the limits of the powers embodied in RA 11054.

The Bangsamoro government under the BOL provided greater fiscal autonomy through the Block Grant, Special Development Fund, and enhanced powers for revenue generation/tax collection. This will give more opportunity to fund the priority programs/projects identified in this Plan. The region does not need to go to Congress and the Senate to beg for funding. But with the fiscal autonomy granted by the BOL, the regional government has the free hand to decide on how it can allocate its annual block grant based on the needs and priorities of the region.

Critical programs and projects for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of affected communities and development of the region that cannot be funded out of the annul block grant can access the Special Development Fund (SDF) and the National Assistance for the implementation projects in the BARMM.

The shift from the unitary to parliamentary form of government supports stronger executive-legislative working relationships. Also, the merging of different agencies in one ministry allows for integrated and systematic interventions. The creation of offices (women, culture, IP) gives them a bigger budget for implementation.

The BOL also addresses issues on previously undevolved mandates/offices which may now be strengthened, thus, addressing government response capacities. The establishment of intergovernmental relations bodies will also address vertical and horizontal governmental concerns.

The expansion of territory of the region through the inclusion of Cotabato City and 63 barangays will strengthen the region’s socioeconomic potentials. Improved resources and capacities will also enable the full implementation of strategies that build on the region’s uniqueness and comparative advantages such as Halal, economic zones, and barter trading.

One of the opportunities in the transition is the strong interest and support of the development partners in the implementation of priority programs and projects in the BARMM. Another opportunity is the advocacy for moral governance, which will address long constrained governance and development in the region.

Moral governance offers a distinct opportunity to unleash the capacities innate to the Bangsamoro; and establish systems, structures and policies of government most appropriate to our aspirations, culture and identity. Learning from the experience of previous autonomous governments, there is a need to establish systems and measures necessary to instill transparency, accountability, inclusivity and sustainable governance in order to change the mindset and restore public trust to the government and institutions necessary to put the transition period in good shape and in right direction."

**1st BDP 2020-2022 Formulation Process**

The formulation of the 1st BDP 2020-2022 and its accompanying Results Matrices (RM) and BDIP, was undertaken through an extensive process. It involves series of planning workshops with ministries, agencies, and offices; and consultations with local government units (LGUs), civil society organizations (CSOs), private sector organizations (PSOs), academe, and other stakeholders at the regional, provincial, and municipal levels.

The Planning Committees (PCs) for the 1st BDP 2020-2022 were convened as follows: a) Development Administration; b) Social Development; c) Economic Development; d) Infrastructure Development; and e) Peace, Public Order, Safety and Security. The five (5) PCs spearheaded the plan formulation process conducted from July to November 2019. The BPDA served as the Technical Secretariat to the PCs.

The schedule of activities is documented in Annex A.
