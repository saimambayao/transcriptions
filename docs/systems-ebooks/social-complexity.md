**Preface**

This book is an accessible introduction to the application of complexity theory to the social sciences. The book will be primarily focused on the domain of sociology, but we will touch upon elements of psychology, anthropology, political science, and economics. The aim of the book is to introduce you to the variety of models from complex systems and illustrate how they apply to these different domains.

This book is a first of its kind and somewhat experimental in nature, where we will be drawing upon research from many different areas and using complexity theory to contextualize it into a coherent paradigm, giving us a fresh perspective with which to interpret some of the core questions within the social sciences.

**Content**

The content is organized into four underlying parts, in each part we will apply one of the major modeling frameworks from complexity theory to interpreting social phenomena.

We will firstly give an overview of this area of social complexity before starting our first part on systems theory. As we lay down a basic model of a social system, we will go on to use this model in helping us understand, social structure and institutions.

Next, we will take an overview of nonlinear social science, as we discuss the process of self-organization, feedback loops, chaos theory and self organized criticality.

The third part of the book is dedicated to social network analysis, we will cover the main topics in this new area as we talk about the basics of social graphs, clustering, network structure and the process of diffusion.

Finally, we will be looking through the lens of complex adaptive systems theory, exploring the model of a fitness landscape, talking about adaptive capacity, social resilience and the process of evolution.

**Audience**

This book is designed to be accessible to a broad audience but will be of particular interest to researchers and students within the various social sciences wishing to apply complexity theory within their own work. Some background in social theory and complexity theory would be an advantage but not a prerequisite.

**Social Complexity**

This book is about introducing you to a new approach or paradigm for modeling and analyzing social phenomena based on complex systems. Complexity science represents an alternative approach to our traditional scientific framework. As such, it brings with it a coherent alternative paradigm, a new set of theoretical models based upon that paradigm, and a new set of computational methods. So in this chapter, we will be taking a very high-level view of this whole approach to social science and try to give an outline of how it differs from a more traditional approach taking within the social sciences. First, we will talk about this more traditional approach to make it explicit before discussing social complexity.

**Social Science**

We can loosely define social science as the study of human beings and the relations between those individuals that give rise to macro patterns of social organization called society. Like all empirical sciences, it is engaged in the enterprise of trying to describe some subset of phenomena in our world. In this case, the phenomena of interest is human society, and we do this by amassing empirical data and developing logically consistent theoretical models to effectively interpret patterns within that data.

But this scientific enterprise does not happen in a vacuum, it happens within a certain cultural context and depends upon a certain set of philosophical assumptions about the way the world is. Physicists don't go into the laboratory every day and question whether there really is such a thing as some objective universe out there, this is a philosophical question rather than a scientific one. So what really happens is that researchers go into their lab every day and operate based upon a certain set of assumptions about the way the world is. What important questions to ask, what valid processes of reasoning there are, etc. and as long as the whole community of researchers shares those assumptions then they have the supporting context within which to conduct their collaborative research enterprise.

**Paradigms**

This set of assumptions that support a scientific domain and constitutes the whole philosophical framework within which they work is called a paradigm. The Oxford dictionary defines a paradigm as "a worldview underlying the theories and methodology of a particular scientific subject". The paradigm or set of assumptions within which the enterprise of modern science operates was born approximately five hundred years ago with the massive cultural transformation of the Renaissance and scientific revolution that gave us the cultural foundations of our modern world.

**The Clockwork Universe**

This new paradigm really came together and first found its most coherent full expression within the work of Sir Isaac Newton, whose work was extremely influential for centuries to come and laid the foundations of modern science and of course, built into this foundation was a set of assumptions about how the world works. This whole set of assumptions is called the Newtonian paradigm or the clockwork universe; in slightly more technical terms it can also be called linear systems theory. Linear systems theory forms the backbone to all of modern science. It is used in every domain from physics to biology to economics to psychology.

The Newtonian paradigm is materialistic and atomistic in nature. It sees the world as a set of isolated objects that interact in a linear cause and effect fashion. The Newtonian clockwork universe receives its name because within this paradigm the universe is seen to be compared to a big mechanical clock. It continues ticking along like a perfect machine with its gears governed by the laws of physics, making every aspect of the machine perfectly orderly and predictable. Within this paradigm, we can understand and know this whole machine of the universe by understanding all the parts and the simple linear interactions between these parts. The whole clock is clearly nothing more than the sum of its parts and thus, to understand it we can use the process of inquiry called reductionism, also called analysis. Whereby we break the whole thing down into these isolated individual parts and study the properties of those parts in isolation and how they interact with each other. If we can then create a set of equations that describe this, then it is game over. We have completed this process of inquiry and now know everything that is there to know.

**Methodological Individualism**

This approach to the scientific inquiry called analysis was very successful within classical physics and came to define what modern science is considered to be and got applied to many different areas throughout the 18th, 19th and 20th century. Its application within the social sciences has given us what is called methodological individualism used in many different areas of the social sciences, most prominently within standard economics.

Methodological individualism is the requirement that causal accounts of social phenomena explain how they result from the motivations and actions of individual agents. It considers that the only thing in the social world that is real are the things that you can touch and see, which is individual humans. This is the materialistic and atomistic nature to the Newtonian paradigm. All phenomena have to be traced back to some discrete tangible entity that can be defined in isolation and described in terms of a set of properties. Within this paradigm, when all is said and done, society can be nothing more than all of its constituent individuals.

This paradigm of methodological individualism then gives us a whole approach to studying social phenomena, one that is focused on the properties of the individuals and their linear interactions. So in using this approach, we are going to want to amass data about the properties of the individuals, like a national census where you fill in your age, gender, occupation, etc. Once we have all of this data, we are then going to look for linear interactions between the variables called correlation analysis, which is a statistical technique that can show whether and how strongly pairs of variables are related. For example, we might ask if there is a linear correlation between an individual's level of education and their income. We would then collect the data about individuals and do a scatter plot to see how closely the values of these properties move together.

This approach can describe simple linear interactions, the interaction between two, three or four variables. It works well on the micro level, and this was the primary focus of science before the eighteen-hundreds where we were dealt with things like the relations between temperature and pressure, population and time, production and trade etc.

During the eighteen-hundreds, scientists developed methods for dealing with macro systems composed of many parts by using statistical methods and probability theory, with most of this happening within the domain of statistical mechanics, where they were trying to model such a phenomenon as a gas in a chamber with billions of atoms. Phenomena of this kind are sometimes called disorganized complexity. In such cases, we are dealing with systems composed of many disorganized parts, that is to say, a large set of random variables; the variables have to be independent and identically distributed called I.I.D. If each random variable has the same probability distribution as the others and all are mutually independent, then these statistical methods will work. These assumptions only hold within linear systems but by imposing them we can say things about the macro system without actually getting our hands dirty and looking at what is really going on inside. We can say that it will follow the law of large numbers, the central limit theorem. We can use mean field theory and make estimations, talk about the average normal person and so on. And this is a very important and useful shortcut. But it has its limitation.

**Complexity**

We won't go into any more of the detail to this approach but sufficed to say linear systems theory works well for simple linear systems, that is, systems that have a finite amount of independent homogeneous elements interacting in a well-defined fashion with a relatively low level of connectivity. But this is often not what we see when dealing with social phenomena. Many social phenomena such as whole economies, social institutions, cultures, and the human psychology to name just a few are fundamentally complex in nature. By complex, we mean that they consist of many, autonomous, diverse components that are highly interconnected and interdependent. In these complex systems, the scientific underpinnings of our traditional formal approaches begin to break down.

And this leaves the social sciences somewhat divided in its response to the question of whether we go on using these formal methods whose assumptions when applied to social systems are floored, or do we abandon formal methods altogether. For example, we can see this divide between economics and sociology where standard economics has fully embraced linear systems theory, giving it quite powerful formal mathematical models. But in order for it to do that, it has to package up quite subtle and complex social phenomenon into a relatively simple set of assumptions, leaving it subject to continuous critic surrounding its foundational assumptions. While much of sociology and other social sciences, feels this approach is throwing the baby out with the bathwater, and continue to pursue their enquiry without the support of any real coherent formal system. However, this leaves certain doubts surrounding their status as science, as formal languages are an integral part of the whole enterprise of science. And this is giving us what is called economic imperialism where economics, the only social science that has a formal basis, increasingly dominates the others.

Complexity theory is fundamentally a set of formal models, so we will just make a quick side note about formal methods before moving on. Formal languages are what make a scientific domain coherent and robust, as the scientist Ernest Rutherford once said: "All science is either physics or stamp collecting.” This is clearly a very arrogant statement, but there is some truth to it. Physics is by far the most robust and advanced domain of science, largely because it is directly supported by the sophisticated formal language of standard mathematics. The higher mathematics used in fundamental physics is not about the x's and y's that you learned in algebra at school. It is about fundamental and powerful concepts that describe patterns of organization in terms of symmetries, transformations, and invariance. It is these very abstract and powerful concepts that are captured within the language of mathematics that give physics the tools to tackle very difficult phenomena in a coherent fashion. The social sciences often lack these abstract formal methods that are powerful tools for solving difficult questions. A formal language is what gives a scientific domain the capacity to speak with one voice. Without the support of a formal language, you end up with many different subdomains speaking many different languages without any capacity to relate them. And when someone comes looking for an answer, you end up giving them a hundred different models.

**Complexity Theory**

Over the past few decades, we have seen the formation of the beginnings of a formal language for modeling the complex systems that social scientists study without resorting to reductionist methods, it is called complexity theory. Complexity theory is based upon very abstract formal mathematical models, but probably not the kind you are used to. And we should be clear that although a lot of complexity theory really originates in mathematics and physics is not another excuse for trying to reduce social life to little particles of matter that get moved around on mass by forces. It starts with a recognition that these reductionist methods have their limitation.

So complexity theory starts with an alternative paradigm to that of analysis. This paradigm is really inherited from systems theory. Systems theory is based upon a process of reasoning called syntheses, which is the opposite of analysis and reductionism. This paradigm is referred to as being what is called holistic, meaning that it is characterized by the belief that the parts of something are intimately interconnected and explicable only by reference to the whole. Syntheses mean the combination of components or elements to form a connected whole. It is a process of reasoning that describes an entity through the context of its relations and functioning within the whole system that it is a part of.

Thus, syntheses focus on the relations between the elements, that is to say, the way those elements are put together or arrange into a functioning entirety. Within this paradigm, we are trying to identify the complex of relations within which an entity is embedded, and its place and function within the whole. Within systems thinking this context is considered the primary frame of reference for describing something. We are then not particularly interested in breaking things down and talking about the properties of the parts, but we are more interested in these interactions and what emerges out of them.

Paradigms like this are always quite abstract, so let's take a quick example. Let's say we are trying to understand the origins of the First World War. Well, from an analytical perspective we would talk about how Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo and how this effect caused a reaction from Russia which caused another reaction from Germany which in turn caused England to react and so on. In this paradigm, we would talk about the properties of the parts and the cause and effect interactions. Now, from a systems perspective, we would focus on quite the opposite. We would be looking at the whole context both in space and the process in time, the nexus of relations out of which this phenomenon emerged. We might then talk about how, through industrialization and nationalization, the international political environment within pre-war Europe self-organized into a critical state and it was out of this whole context that we got the emergence of the First World War. The assassination didn't then cause the war; nothing directly caused the war. It was out of the nonlinear interactions of many different factors that we got a critical state of the system and out of that critical state we got these emergent phenomena.

**New Models**

So this gives us some insight into this alternative paradigm. But how does this actually translate into models that we can use? Complexity theory represents a combination of a number of different modeling frameworks that have developed in different areas in order to deal with complexity. All of which have in common a focus on the interactions between parts and how these interactions give rise to emergent phenomena on the macro level. Agent-based modeling is one good example of this. Agent-based models are a class of computational model for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents in order to try and model their effect on the system as a whole. As an example, we could think about trying to model the spreading of some virus within a population. We have a traditional equation-based model called SIR which will describe this process in a top-down fashion, but we can also describe this with agent models where we ascribe simple rules to the agents and then run the program to see what aggregate phenomena emerge from the bottom up.

Another major modeling framework within complexity theory is that of network theory that is focused on the connections between actors and how the structure of those connections affect the actors and the system as a whole. Network theory gives us a formal language to model such things as power and influence within social systems. By looking at the structure of connections that surround an individual, network theory gives us a language for talking about how things spread through a network. Nonlinear systems theory is another major modeling framework that helps us talk about the non-additive interactions between agents in space and over time. How through these nonlinear interactions of synergies or interference we get the emergence of macro level non-equilibrium phenomena that make the whole more or less than the sum of its part. This language of feedback loops and chaos helps us in talking about non-equilibrium processes of change where the whole system moves rapidly in one direction. And this is just a quick sample of some of the topics we will be covering in this book.

**Tools**

Finally, we will talk about the new set of practical methods and tools that complexity science uses. Complexity science is a science fundamentally based on computation. The rise of computation within the social sciences is one of the quiet but major revolutions taking place in contemporary science. let’s will quote the social network scientist, Duncan Watts in describing this phenomena as such: "Up until about ten years ago it was impossible to observe these (social) interactions and it is very, very hard to do science when you can't observe things, it is very hard to do science when you can't measure the things you are interested in. And what has changed in the last ten years or so and why it is so exciting for people like me to be at the intersection of social and computation science is that the internet has really unveiled, has really made the invisible visible, has really given us the capacity to measure the interaction between even hundreds of millions of people in real time and over extended periods of time. .. it feels like for many of us in the social sciences, like we have stumbled upon our equivalent of the telescope, the device, the technology that makes the invisible visible and historically that has lead to dramatic improvements in science."

To date, the primary sources of data for social scientist were survey research, government statistics and one off in-depth studies of particular people. The statistical databases of governments and the World Bank are full of information about individual people and their properties. They tell us almost nothing about the connections between those individuals because up until very recently we didn't have the computation capacity to manage and utilize large complex databases of that kind. But with the rise of the internet and particularly online social networks, this is all changing. We are going from a limited amount of randomly selected historical data on individuals to a mass of real data about the connections between people. This big data is set to revolutionize our insight into human interaction. The future of the social sciences is a lot to do with the new opportunities that are arising from these new computational capabilities and data sources. With these new opportunities for the first time, we have the capacity to not just model society in terms of individuals and simple statistical interactions, but instead in terms of context. We have for the first time in a rigorous way the capacity to map and model context, the context of a choice, the context of a behavior, and the complex interplay of a lot of different free parameters all at once. This has always been very difficult because of lack of data and computational intractability.

These new tools of computation and new data sources are very important, but at the end of the day they are just tools, they will not in themselves, help us solve difficult problems within social theory - age-old questions about the relationship between individual agency and social structure, questions about the exercise of social power, about the formation of the individual, about the rise and fall of civilizations. But with these new computational (Continued from page 14)

questions about the exercise of social power, about the formation of the individual, about the rise and fall of civilizations. But with these new computational methods and a new set of sophisticated theoretical tools from complexity theory, we can apply them to see what fresh insight we can get on these perennial challenges within the social sciences.

**Summary**

In this chapter, we have given a quick overview of the application of complexity theory to the social sciences - what we called social complexity. We started off with a very broad discussion surrounding the scientific enterprise as we talked about paradigms in general and the Newtonian paradigm in particular, how it forms the basis for modern science and how this approach of reductionism gets translated into methodological individualism within the social sciences - an approach that is focused on the properties of the components within the system and linear cause and effect interactions between them, with the whole being a simple summation of its parts, allowing us to use statistical analysis.

We talked about how the basic assumptions underpinning our traditional formal approaches begin to fail when we start to deal with more complex systems consisting of many autonomous, diverse components that are highly interconnected and interdependent, as often is the case within the social sciences. We briefly introduced complexity theory as an alternative approach to modeling these complex systems, an approach that is based upon a paradigm inherited from systems theory that uses synthetic reasoning instead of analysis. We briefly touched upon some of the major modeling frameworks that operate within this paradigm, including agent-based modeling, network theory and nonlinear systems theory. Finally, we touched upon how complexity science is based upon a new set of computation methods and how big data is set to have a transformative effect on the social sciences in the coming decades.

**Social Systems**

A social system is a set of individuals and relations between them through which they form part of some interdependent organization as a whole. The basic model of a social system consists of social actors, called agents and a set of relations between them that bind them into some state of interdependence where the actions and state of one effect the state of others. Social actors have what is called agency, meaning an individual or organization that acts to produce a particular result. Game theory can define social actors interactions in terms of positive, negative or zero-sum games. These, in turn, give rise to different relations of cooperation, conflict or exchange with associated social structure and dynamics. The idea of a system is central to dealing with social complexity as it offers us a very abstract model and solid basis on which to structure our reasoning about complex social systems.

**Social Systems**

A system is a set of parts called elements, and the connections between these parts called relations. Through these relations, the elements are interdependent in affecting a joint outcome. By interdependent, we mean that if we change the state of one element this will affect the state of other elements within the system. We can contrast a system with a set, where a set consists of a group of independent elements such as a bowl of fruit. If we change one of the fruit, this would not affect any of the others because the variables associated with each element are independent.

A social system is then a set of social actors and the relations or ties between them. Again, we could contrast a social system with a simple set of people, such as a group of people waiting for a bus, which are simply a collection of unassociated individuals. But now imagine when the bus arrives, there is an elderly lady who needs help to get on the bus, so one person comes to hold the door open and two others give her support on each side. Now, we have a social system because the individuals are interrelated and interdependent in affecting the joint outcome. All the individuals are arranged in a particular fashion or occupy a particular state in order to perform a collective function; as such the individuals are interdependent. And this is the same for all social systems, such as a corporation that has well-defined roles and relations between those roles through which they perform a collective function of producing some goods or services. A government is another example of a social system with well-defined differentiated roles that relate to each other and are interdependent in performing the collective function of social governance.

**Social Actors**

Social systems are made up of social actors or what are called agents within complexity theory. Agents are abstract models of individuals or organizations which have agency, meaning the capacity to make choices and to act independently on those choices to affect the state of their environment. In order to make choices, agents need some set of rules under which to make those choices. This set of instructions or rules can be based on some simple linear cause and effect model, such as a trader choosing to sell a stock if it goes below a certain price. This basic set of linear rules we call an algorithm. But these choices may be much more complex such as when choosing whether to change carriers or not. These more complex decisions are the product of many interacting factors. They are not the product of simple cause and effect dynamic but they emerge out of the agent’s representation of its environment and some set of values called a schema. With this capacity of agency comes autonomy. In choices and actions, agents define themselves as independent from other things and thus define their own identity with associated responsibility for their actions.

**Organizations**

Agency is not then just a property of an individual but organizations can have agency, that is to say, we as individuals can give over our agency to other people or organizations. For example, take the case of Kate who is a shop owner making an inventory she realizes that she needs more stock so she sends one of her employees James to make this order. James is now acting on the behalf of Kate; he is a legal agent, a party that is legally authorized to act on the behalf of another. Kate is considered the principal in this relationship, meaning she has given authority to another to act on her behalf, both principal and agent can be individuals or organizations. Or to take another example this agent-principal relation is the one that we have with our politicians within a democratic republic. We hand over our choices within the political decision-making process to our representatives.

In the same way that we empower organizations with agency and in doing so, we hand over our choices and actions to them. The reverse is also true once organizations have agency, they then endow this upon roles within that organization. The individuals fulfilling those roles are then empowered with that agency; they can make choices and act on behalf of the organization. A commander of an army can tell his troops what to do because they have given that organization their agency, that is to say, their independent choices and actions and the organization has endowed anyone occupying the role of the commander with the authority to make choice and guide their actions for them.

**Complex Interdependency**

Agents within social systems have agency; they act based upon their representation of the world or schema in order to affect some desired outcome. And thus, as soon as we have two or more agents, we may have some form of interaction between them as they both follow their agendas. In this interaction, agents become interdependent. This dynamic of interdependence is described within social interdependence theory, which posits two different types of social interdependence, positive and negative. Positive interdependence exists when there is a positive correlation among individuals’ goal attainments, meaning that individuals perceive that they can attain their goals if and only if the other individuals with whom they are cooperatively linked attain their goals. Negative interdependence exists when there is a negative correlation among individuals’ goal achievements; individuals perceive that they can obtain their goals if the other individual with whom they are competitively linked fail to obtain their goals. Along with these two types of interaction, we may also have an interaction of simple exchange which is described within standard economics by ration choice theory. Here, agents are simply swapping one thing for another in a linear fashion. These interactions can be formalized within game theoretical terms. Positive interdependencies are zero or positive sum games, meaning the whole pie may get bigger through cooperation. Negative interdependencies are zero or negative sum games, meaning the whole pies may get smaller through the interaction. Exchange interactions give us zero-sum games; the whole is not changing, we are simply moving around who gets what. These different types of interdependencies create attractors towards fundamentally different types of interaction between agents; that of cooperation derived from positive interdependence and that of conflict derived from negative interdependence and trade from interactions of exchange.

**Conflict & Cooperation**

Conflictual relations are zero or negative-sum interactions where the interests of one are pitted against those of other. Relations of conflict arise when agents with divergent agendas interact over some rival resource. By rival, we mean that the resource that each agent desires is exclusive where only one agent can own or occupy that resource at any given time. This may include some physical resources, some social status, ideology etc. This interdependence coupled with excludability means one agent can obtain more of some rival resources by reducing another’s access to it, which creates a dynamic of conflict. When agent’s agendas are aligned towards a common outcome we can get cooperative relations. Cooperation is the process of groups of social actors working or acting together for their common mutual benefit or that of others. Cooperation is often the product of needing to perform some function that requires individuals with different capabilities to coordinate their activities towards a common outcome. In such a dynamic for any one agent to achieve the desired outcome, every other agent has to also achieve it, meaning that each agent will be equally interested in the fulfillment of their own role and agenda as that of other. For example, if a father or mother is interested in providing a good family context for raising their child, they will have to be equally interested in the fulfillment of their role as much as the fulfillment of the role of their partner and this creates a very strong attractor towards cooperation. When agents with different capabilities coordinate their activities we get what is called a synergy.

**Exchange**

Exchange involves a two-sided, mutually rewarding process involving a trade like transactions where agents simply swap things. It is formed out of the agent’s subjective cost-benefit analysis and their comparison of alternatives. As self-interest and rationality are central properties in an exchange interaction, social exchange theory features many of the main assumptions found in rational choice theory. Whereas the two firstly cited types of interaction will typically give us nonlinear results, meaning conflict or cooperation will add or subtract significant value from the whole system, Exchange instead will typically give near-linear results since we are simply swapping things around. No great value to the whole system is being added or subtracted through the exchange and the whole will remain more or less a simple summation of its parts. Because exchange can be best described with reference to (Continued from page 19/20)

linear models it is understood very well within Standard Economic Theory.

**Social Structure**

Out of these different types of relations, develops some form of enduring structure to that system called social structure. In the social sciences, social structure is the pattern of social arrangements in society that are both emergent from and determinant of the actions and relations between agents. As enduring patterns of behavior and interaction, they define some form order to the overall system. Again, the type of social structure that emerges is largely a product of the type of interaction between agents.

**Hierarchy**

With relations of negative interdependence, because resources are excludable, the net result will always be one some agents assuming a dominant position while others a subordinated position, thus defining a power dynamic. By power, we mean the capacity to direct or influence the behavior of others irrespective of their personal agenda. The power dynamics that hold a particular social structure within a configuration are an organic product of agonistic interactions between agents over excludable resources. The social structure that emerges out of this competition will be the formation of some kind of stratified social system based upon access to the rival good. This may also be called a hierarchy which arises when members of a social group interact to create a social structure with a linear or nearly linear ranking system, with that ranking system directly correlated to the distribution of some underlining desired resources within the system such as economic value, social prestige, decision-making power, etc. The conflictual relations that are an inherent part of this type of social system are a constant potential for disorder, and it is seen that there needs to be some counter prevailing force exerted in order to maintain the social structure. The order is seen to derive through the exercising of authority in a top-down fashion through some centralized control system.

**Collaboration**

Cooperative relations give rise to collaborative organizations where agents self-organize around a common function. Cooperation gives rise to peer dynamics. When the realization of each agent’s agenda is recognized as being important in the realization of the combined agenda and when there are limited hierarchical structures based on consumption, then relations are horizontal in nature, creating a network structure. Order within this type of system is seen to derive from the interconnections and the positive interdependencies between agents. It is these interdependencies that bind the system into an integrated whole and thus maintain some form of structure and coherence. From this perspective, the greater the differentiation and specialization between the agents, the greater the positive interdependency between them and the greater the glue binding them into a state of order.

The net result of collaboration is what is called emergence. The synergistic relations are nonlinear, they add value to the whole system and out of this added value, we get the emergence of a new level of organization, a collective function. For example, through all the ants performing differentiated functions and coordinating these individual functions within the whole colony, we get the emergence of a complex society whose capability and structure is qualitatively different from that of any of its components, that is to say out of these synergies a new level of organization has emerged. This phenomenon of emergence is ubiquitous across all types of social systems, from families to communities to business organizations. This emergent phenomenon creates a structure that is not associated with any of the individual properties of the parts that form it.

**Utilitarian Organization**

Relations of exchange give us a market like social structure. This social structure will often have some centralized third party that mediates and facilitates the exchange, like a bank that takes in deposits and hands out loans. All three parties are engaging in this interaction out of their own interests and the net result is a market structure that has some kind of equilibrium representing a balance between all of the different parties self-interests, like that between supply and demand.

**Dynamics**

These different social structures have very different internal dynamics, that is to say, processes through which the internal social structure changes over time. The dynamics of hierarchical social systems composed predominantly of competitive relations are described within sociology by conflict theory. Conflict theory posits that the dominant strata within the hierarchy will use their position and resources to maintain their privileged position. In doing so, they will reduce social mobility and people of merit will not be able to rise, meaning those in the upper stators become less competent and there is also the accumulative effect called the rich get richer, as the whole system becomes more polarized, ultimately leading to an abrupt discontinuous change. As such conflict is seen as an inherent part of the social dynamic, as Karl Marx put it “without conflict no progress: this is the law that civilization has followed to this day.” From the conflict perspective societies develop, because for every action of oppression there is an equal and opposite force that accumulates over time as the two become more diametrically opposed, ultimately leading to a state of complete conflict and an ensuing regime shift. And this is considered the primary dynamic which drives this type of social system as it develops over time.

**Adaptation**

Cooperative relations can be adaptive when the ultimate aim is not to maintain one’s status and access to rival goods, but to enable the operation of a shared function, elements can adapt their role and relation to that of other agents in order to best facilitate the joint outcome. When the ultimate aim of the agent or organization is to perform some collective function, the emphasis is on a person’s competency in performing that function, resulting in a more meritocratic system, an important mechanism for social mobility and integration between different levels within the social system.

**Evolution**

This whole social system exists within some environment and is subject to long term evolution as that environment changes. This change may be in technology and economic conditions, such as the rise of the capitalist system during the early modern era.

society, either way, the whole system goes through long-term processes of change where new functions are required to be performed while others become redundant.

Through this process of evolution the system has to adapt by producing new variance to see which of these are best suited to the changing context, new roles within organizations, new jobs and intuitions within society or new ideas within a culture, with those new social phenomena that are most functional in enabling people and organizations to adapt to the new context being retained, integrated and shared with those that are not becoming less prevalent within the future lifecycle of the system. In such a way the whole social system can evolve in a distributed fashion. Through this process of evolution, the society can successfully adapt to new changes and it develops newly specialized subsystems, as it becomes both more differentiated and integrated leading to what we might call greater complexity.

**Social Agents**

What we wish to do in this chapter is give some basic account of what we mean when we talk about social actors or agents. This book is focused on social systems, as such delving into the psychology of individuals would take us into a new area that is a whole book in itself, so we will be just touching on the subject here to get a basic model to human agency.

The first thing that we should note when discussing human agency is that humans are complex system in themselves, that far exceed any kind of rigorous models we currently might have. Thus what we are describing here are social agents which are models. If they are good models then they should capture some essential features of this phenomenon that we are trying to describe, but we should always remember that models are not real, thus we should recognize the significant disparity between this model of an agent and the actual real world phenomena. Our scientific tools are really quite basic in the face of something as complex and subtle as an individual person. However, that is not to say that we cannot gain some traction on this phenomenon, but we should always recognize the limitations of our models and the complexity of the real world phenomenon that we are dealing with.

**Agents**

As we have previously discussed, agents are the basic building blocks of social systems. From the perspective of the study of social systems, we are then interested in individuals inasmuch as they have the capacity to act and affect the state of the system. In the social sciences, agency is the capacity of individuals to act independently and to make their own free choices. As such we should first recognize that this idea of human agency entails a certain assumption or claim that humans do in fact make decisions and enact them on the world and in so doing they have some degree of autonomy. Agency is then normally contrasted to natural forces, which are causes involving only unthinking deterministic processes.

The concept of agency has become a major paradigm within modern thought as it underpins many of our contemporary social institutions, the idea of democracy and the Declaration of Independence, the idea of a legal agent, human rights etc.

This idea of the autonomous agent is in many ways a direct consequence of the Age of Enlightenment and the idea that every human has the capacity to reason, that in this capacity of reason they have autonomy, they are individual agents.

Reason is the capacity for consciously making sense of things, applying logic, establishing and verifying facts, and changing or justifying practices, institutions, and beliefs based on new or existing information. One's agency is one's independent capability or ability to act on one's will. This ability is affected by the cognitive structure which one has formed through one's experiences.

**Agents Complexity**

Individual human agents are most rigorously studied within philosophy and the behavioral sciences and we will broadly define two different accounts or approaches to understanding individual social agents. Firstly that of the behavioral sciences where people are primarily defined by their physiology. That is, people are understood through their manifest behavior within some physical environment in terms of motives and logic that transfer inputs from the senses to outputs of behavior towards desired ends.

The second more complex representation of human actors comes from philosophy, where people are represented in more subjective conceptual terms. A person is seen to be a complex system of conceptual models, values, ethics, identity etc. out of which they have the capacity to shape their own lives independent from external forces.

**Linear Model**

Firstly we will briefly outline the paradigm of the behavioral sciences that follows the method of empiricism primarily within behavioral psychology and cognitive science. Within this paradigm, social actors are essentially a product of their environment. The behavioral sciences, as their name implies, give us an account of social actors through their manifest behavior. This is an account of people in terms of their senses, motives, physiology and basic processes of reasoning. More recently, with the rise of cognitive science, the computational model to human agents has become more popular.

The fundamental concept of cognitive science is that "thinking can best be understood in terms of representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures." This understanding of agents in terms of their behavior within a physical environment is adopted as the primary model within mainstream economics where it has widespread appeal due to its amenability to linear mathematical models. It is essentially a linear model to how social agents operate, as a function of stimulus from their environment, cognitive inputs and outputs and goal-orientated behavior.

As the psychologist Albert Bandura put it: “Much of the early psychological theorizing was founded on behavioristic principles that embraced an input-output model linked by an internal conduit that makes behavior possible but exerts no influence of its own on behavior. In this view, human behavior was shaped and controlled automatically and mechanically by environmental stimuli. The individual is a simple product of all these forces shaping and reinforcing behavior and thus people are seen to have little or no free will. For decades, the reigning computer metaphor of human functioning was a linear computational system in which information is fed through a central processor that cranks out solutions according to preordained rules. The architecture of the linear computer at the time dictated the conceptual model of human functioning“

**Regulatory System**

This basic model to social agents is most clearly expressed through the idea of a regulatory system, which is a system for effecting, regulating or controlling its environment. This capacity to regulate its environment gives the agent the capacity to counterbalance or alter the influence that its environment has on it, making it at least somewhat independent from its environment. As such, the capacity to control or influence one’s environment is a key component in defining the most basic level of autonomy and agency.

Cybernetics is the science of the control of complex systems of various types — technical, biological, or social. The term cybernetics comes from the ancient Greek word kybernetikos (“good at steering”), referring to the art of the helmsman. This image of a person steering a boat along some predefined course is a good illustration of the whole process of regulation, the helmsman (or helmswoman) is continuously receiving information about the trajectory of the boat, processing this information and then adjusting the rudder accordingly.

This model (Continued from page 27)

of control applies to all types of social actors, from nation states, to businesses, to local communities and individuals. 

Regulatory systems of all kind require some capacity to sense, process and actuate. A regulatory system is then the actual apparatus through which the agent receives information, processes it and then acts, for example for an individual person this is our senses, that receive information, our brain that processes that information and our muscles that perform the action. Or we could also take a government as another example receiving information about the state of the nation from the bureau of statistics, media and other sources, with many different government officials analyzing and processing this information to create a set of actions that are then put in into law and enforced, acted out by government and social workers and supported by law enforcement agencies. All of these different components to a regulatory system need to be working and working together, in order for the agent to be capable of affecting its environment. If I lose the strength in my muscles or if a government loses the support of its armed forces it will lose its capacity to act, which will reduce its autonomy and agency. 

Nonlinear Model 

By using this model of a regulatory system to describe social actors we get a very narrow vision of human agency where people would behave like weather vanes, constantly shifting direction to conform to whatever influence happened to impinge upon them at that moment. In actuality, people can display considerable self-direction in the face of competing influences. People are not just on looking hosts of internal mechanisms orchestrated by environmental events, they are agents of experiences rather than simply undergo experiences. The sensory, motor, and cerebral systems are tools people use to accomplish the tasks and goals that give meaning, direction, and satisfaction to their lives. The human mind is generative, creative, proactive, and reflective, not just reactive. Agency thus involves not only the deliberative ability to make choices and action plans but also the ability to give shape to appropriate courses of action and to motivate and regulate their execution. 

In order to get this more complex form of agency, we will need a number of different components. Agents will need to be endowed with some model or representation of their environment. Agents will also need to have some system of logic in order to process information. To able to make independent choices, they will need some form of a value system on which to base their choices and in order to act out those choices and affect their environment, they will need a control system as previously outlined. With this full capacity of agency comes autonomy. In their choices and actions, agents define themselves as independent from other entities and thus define their own identity with associated responsibility for their actions. We will quickly go over each of these separately. 

Schema 

The first thing we will need to get agency is some form of what we call a schema, which is a conceptual model or representation of the agent’s environment, what might also be called an ontology, a set of conceptual categories and relations between them. For example, a culture consists of some body of shared knowledge, such as in Western culture where we have science as our shared body of knowledge that defines different categories and how they relate to each other. Along with an ontology, we also need an epistemology, which is a mechanism for defining and validating new information. An example of this might be the peer review system within the scientific community. It is designed to filter new information, designating it as either valid and incorporating it into the ontology or invalid and rejecting it. As an example of this on the individual level, we might think about how we are constantly receiving new information and cross referencing it with what we already know to check if it is valid before incorporating it into what we consider to be a fact. This process is often modeled within computer science using some form of Bayesian inferences. 

Logic 

In order to process information, an agent needs some form of logic. A set of instructions or rules that define valid processes of reasoning. This can be a very simple algorithmic logic, such as someone working on a production line might use to assemble the parts through a set of well-defined stages. This simple set of rules is in many ways objective as we could write it down and share it, but this set of rules may also be a more complex nonlinear logic. Think about the combined logic under which a board of directors of a company might decide the future trajectory of the enterprise, this complex form of logic is more implicit and subjective. 

Choices 

Agents not only have a schema but they also make choices. In order to do this, they have to evaluate options. That is to say, they have to have some form of a value system which defines what is of greater and lesser value to that agent, this is called an axiology, a system for defining the value of different entities. These value systems give rise to desires, needs and wants, that motivate agents into action what is called a teleology. When we say that agents are teleological, it means that they exhibit goal-orientated behavior. Their actions are not random, they are specifically designed for the pursuit of the things they place positive value on and in avoidance of the things on which they place negative value. This value may be of any kind: social capital, cultural capital, financial capital etc. This teleological behavior is also what we call an agenda, that is to say when agents act in a goal orientated fashion they are said to be pursuing an agenda, which may be defined as the underlying intentions or motives of a particular person or group. 

Identity 

In having independent choice and action, an agent has autonomy. With this autonomy, come both identity and responsibility. When something is autonomous, it is identified as a distinct class and in the process of classifying things we give them an identity, that agent’s identity is then associated with and held responsible for its actions. Thus with agency and autonomy of action comes responsibility and the ethics and morals associated with responsibility. Thus to have full agency we also need to have some system of ethics, a moral code that defines what is correct or incorrect behavior in maintaining some responsibility, those responsibilities can, of course, be of many different kind: social, cultural, economic etc. and also context dependent. 

Efficacy 

Efficacy beliefs are the foundation of human agency. Unless people believe they can produce desired results and forestall detrimental one’s by their actions, they have little incentive to act or to persevere in the face of difficulties. Whatever other factors may operate as guides and motivators, they are rooted in the core belief that one has the power to produce effects by one's actions. Efficacy beliefs play a central role in the self-regulation of motivation through goal challenges and outcome expectations. It is partly on the basis of efficacy beliefs that people choose what challenges to undertake, how much effort to expend in the endeavor, how long to persevere in the face of obstacles and failures, and whether failures are motivating or demoralizing. When people feel disempowered they may actively manipulate uncertainty and lack of information towards a pattern that promotes their stability, religion, and ideology. 

Proxy & Collective Agency 

In many spheres of functioning, people do not have direct control over the social conditions and institutional practices that affect their everyday lives. Under these circumstances, they seek their well-being, security, and valued outcomes through the exercise of proxy agency. In this socially mediated mode of agency, people try by one means or another to get those who have access to resources or expertise or who wield influence and power to act at their behest to secure the outcomes they desire. 

People also turn to proxy control in areas in which they can exert direct influence when they have not developed the means to do so. They believe others can do it better, or they do not want to saddle themselves with the burdensome aspects that direct control entails. Personal control is neither an inherent drive nor universally desired, as is commonly claimed. There is an onerous side to direct personal control that can dull the appetite for it. The exercise of effective control requires mastery of knowledge and skills attainable only through long hours of arduous work. 

All too often, they surrender control to intermediaries in activities over which they can command direct influence. They do so to free themselves of the performance demands and onerous responsibilities that personal control entails. Proxy agency can be used in ways that promote self-development or impede the cultivation of personal competencies. In the latter case, part of the price of proxy agency is a vulnerable security that rests on the competence, power, and favors of others. 

Through individuals combining their agency, we create some form of collective agency. The organization’s capacity to act as an integrated whole, to have agency is a function of the individuals giving over their choices and actions to that organization. For example, when we go into work we give over our agency to that of the organization allowing it to make choices as to how we act when part of that organizations and out of that emerges the combined agency. 

Excerpts taken from: Social cognitive theory an agent perspective - Albert Bandura. 

**Social Interdependency Theory**

In the previous chapter, we gave a high-level overview to social systems, briefly touching on the different types of relations between agents. In this chapter we want to dig a bit deeper into these qualitatively different types of interaction between agents within a social system as we discuss further the theory of social interdependency. 

As we previously discussed the essence of a social system is the interdependence among members, which results in the group being a dynamic whole so that a change in the state of any member or subgroup changes the state of any other member or subgroup. Group members are made interdependent through common goals. 

In social interdependence theory, the nature of the interdependence between two individuals is contingent upon the manner in which each can influence what happens to the other during the course of the social interaction, and this is called "outcome interdependence". 

The basic premise of social interdependence theory is that the way in which goals are structured determines how individuals interact, that is to say, the types of relations between them. The theory posits two different types of social interdependence, positive and negative. Positive interdependence exists when there is a positive correlation among individuals’ goal attainments; individuals perceive that they can attain their goals if and only if the other individuals with whom they are cooperatively linked attain their goals. Negative interdependence exists when there is a negative correlation among individuals’ goal achievements; individuals perceive that they can obtain their goals if and only if the other individual with whom they are competitively linked fail to obtain their goals. 

Negative Interdependency 

Negative interdependence creates relations of competition and conflict. Conflict arises when agent’s agendas are mutually exclusive. In order to get this dynamic, agents must be acting under different agendas over the same rival goal. The agents must be acting under their own personal agenda or that of a group that the other agent or agents are not acting on behalf of. Conflictual relations define boundaries around the personal interest of (Continued from page 32/33)

an agent and the conflict is always between the agents that are internal to the boundary and those external to it, as such, they work to define borders and differences between social actors.

**Conflict**

Conflictual relations are an inherent part of negative interdependence, Wikipedia has a good definition for social conflict: “Social conflict is the struggle for agency or power in society. Social conflict or group conflict occurs when two or more actors oppose each other in social interaction, reciprocally exerting social power in an effort to attain scarce or incompatible goals and prevent the opponent from attaining them. It is a social relationship wherein the action is oriented intentionally for carrying out the actor's own will against the resistance of other party or parties“

Because conflictual relations are over a rival good where only one person’s agency can prevail, in every interaction of conflict agents are defining who has agency and who does not, or who controls the combined agency. There is always a reduction in one agent’s possibilities and set of choices. With the master-slave dynamic being a good example, we are reducing the slave’s agency, possibilities, and choices, in order to enable those of the master. This dynamic was first fully describe by G. W. F Hegel’s in his book The Phenomenology of Spirit, where he noted that when two conscious beings, who believe themselves to be absolutely free and unrestrained, encounter each other, there is a struggle for recognition, leading to the “master-slave dialectic”, where one member ultimately has to submit to the other and become the lesser party (constrained) in the combined agency.

**Power**

This creates a power dynamic between agents. Power is the ability to make others do things they would not otherwise choose to do, that is to say, the capacity to control the agency of another. We tend to think of power as being the property of a person, but this is really shorthand. Power is really a relation between two people. Power only exists in one’s capacity to influence another’s attainment of some positive goal or avoidance of some negative event. As such, power only really exists in our dependency on another in achieving (or avoiding) a certain outcome. This is what is called the dependency theory of power, which posits that the basis of power is dependency. A depends on B if A has goals and needs that B can fulfill. For example, an employee depends on her company for a paycheck. Similarly, a company depends on its employees for their work.

Dependence power indicates that those who are dependent on their relationship or partners are less powerful, in this way power is a force that is exerted over the potential difference of dependency between nodes within a relation. The power dynamic can be changed by the lesser agent not being dependent upon the more powerful agent, or in no longer wishing to obtain the desired outcome upon which the power dynamic is based.

**Dependency**

The dependency of A on B is a function of two things: supply and demand. Demand is defined as the motivational investment by A in goals mediated by B. In other words, how much A needs what B controls and there are a number of parameters to this including availability, quality and cost of alternative means of satisfying needs. In other words, how easy it is for A to go elsewhere to get what B controls. Supply is inversely related to dependency (A depends more on B if there are few alternatives available to A).

So from this perspective, if we were to ask why did the Catholic Church have such power over people during the Middle Ages in Europe? We could derive two answers based on this theory. Firstly we might answer because people wanted to go to heaven and they were dependent upon the church in obtaining that goal. When people stopped believing in and wanting this apparent goal the dependency on the church declined, reducing their power. Equally we might answer that it was because Protestantism and Calvinism came along providing a new doctrine that allowed people to bypass the church in attaining this desired goal.

Thus in negative interdependence, the two agent’s agendas become combined, through conflict the agents define boundaries and who has greater or less representation within that combined agency. The agent with less than equal representation stays within it because of some dependency on the other, this difference in dependency defines a gradient of power between them and a state of inequality.

**Positive Interdependence**

Positive interdependencies are typically built up around some shared function that requires more than one person to perform. An example might be two people carrying a table that is too heavy for either in isolation. In order to achieve the combined outcome, each role has to be fulfilled, thus for any agent to obtain the joint outcome they must be as equally interested in their own function as that of others. This dynamic of cooperation creates a positive sum game. In isolation, neither person could move the table, thus when we simply added both of our individual actions in isolation we would get nothing. When we combined our activities though we got something that was more than the sum of its individual parts. The table was moved, by cooperating we added value to the whole system thus creating a positive-sum game.

**Synergies**

The word synergy means a construct or collection of different elements working together to produce results not obtainable by any of the elements alone. The value added by the system as a whole, beyond that contributed independently by the parts, is created primarily by the relationship among the parts, that is, how they are interconnected, thus things have to be interrelated in a particular fashion.

Synergistic relations are ubiquitous in our world, physical, biological and social, they involve both differentiation and integration. When components are different and working together they complement each other and the combined effect is greater than the sum of its parts. A song is a good example of a cultural synergy, taking more than one musical part and putting them together to create a song that has a much more dramatic effect than each of the parts when played individually. The song as a whole exists out of the interaction between the different instruments, but we only get this emergent phenomenon of the whole song by each individual musician coordinating their activity with that of others, if they are not coordinated we will just get a bad noise.

Whereas conflict defined boundaries and unequal access to some rival resource, cooperation or collaboration is essentially the inverse. Collaboration is working with others to do a task and to achieve shared goals. As such, it requires the reduction in boundaries to enable a common process. In agents having to adapt their activities to that of others, in order to enable the group to succeed, they come to shed their own identity and adopt that of the group, in so doing they (Continued from page 36)

become more equal, with the net result being a less stratified social system.

**Institutions**

Social institutions are a central object of study within the social sciences. They represent enduring patterns of organization or structures built up around some social function. Religions, governments, and families are all institutions that have stood the test of time because they provide essential structure and serve basic functions within social systems.

The concept of a social institution is really very abstract and it is one of the most complex concepts within all of the social sciences, but it is also a very powerful one in that it gives us some kind of unifying concept to all forms of organization within a social system. As such, an institution is really what we would call in systems theory a subsystem. They are meso-level structures between the individual and the whole macro system of a society. Thus, institutions are subsystems, that perform differentiated functions and provide critical structure.

**Structure & Function**

As you may have noticed from this, there are really two different interpretations of this concept of an institution. It may be understood with reference to structure or function. For example in this definition from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy they defined institutions as, “structures or mechanisms of social order and cooperation governing the behavior of a set of individuals within a given community“. We can see in this definition the idea that institutions primarily exist to maintain order and structure. But here is another widely used definition for social institutions as ”a persistent constellation of status, roles, values and norms that respond to important societal needs.” This interpretation places emphases on the idea of social needs and intuitions as mechanisms for performing functions to solve those needs.

To give an example of this we might think about the institution of education from these two different perspectives. We could interpret it as either serving the important function of educating students with the knowledge they need to become working citizens or equally we could understand the education system as a mechanism of social order which governs the behavior of a set of individuals within a given community. Both of these different interpretations to institutions are equally valid and prevalent within the literature.

**Functions**

Social institutions emerge from and are determinant of the actions and relations between agents. Institutions are at the end of the day a type of social system, thus composed of agents and relations through which they are interdependent. All systems perform some function, they take in resources of some kind and process those according to some set of instructions in order to generate an output. In order to perform this function the system needs some form of order or structure to enable the coordination of the elements in performing that process. Systems perform their function only ever to some degree of efficiency, that is to say with any system we can define a simple parameter that maps from a low level of efficiency to a high-level efficiency, this is largely a theoretical construct as in real world complex systems, like institutions efficiency is rarely well defined, but this theoretical construct does help in structuring our reasoning.

**Efficiency**

This degree of efficiency is a very fundamental parameter to a system that really defines its manifest state. When we say that the system is at a low level of efficiency, we mean that more of the resources that are being inputted to the system are being consumed by the components within the system as opposed to being processed into functional outputs. At this low level of efficiency, the system is being defined by the consumption of resources. We have already discussed this dynamic when talking about negative interdependencies that resulted in competition or conflict between the components for access to these rival resources. Out of this dynamic emerges relations of dominance within a stratified hierarchical system. At this low level of efficiency, we are in a component based regime as described by the area of sociology called conflict theory, that we will talk about in a minute.

Inversely, above a certain degree of efficiency, when there is more throughput than consumption, the system comes to be defined by the function that it performs. Within a functional regime, components have to adapt and organize themselves in relation to each other to best facilitate the overall function. This is self-organization and, through it, we get the emergence of a new level of organization in order to support the collective process. This functional regime to (Continued from page 39)

a social system is described within sociology by the theory of functionalism. We will briefly outline both of these different theories to social intuitions starting with functionalism.

**Functionalism**

Functionalism is a theoretical understanding of society that posits social systems are collective means to fulfill social needs. In order for social life to survive and develop in society, there are a number of activities that need to be carried out to ensure that certain needs are fulfilled. In the structural functionalist model, individuals produce necessary goods and services in various institutions and roles that correlate with the norms of the society. These institutions, roles, norms and values are interdependent in maintaining a functional equilibrium within the entire system.

Within this paradigm, order is seen to derive from the interdependencies between the social system’s constituent parts within what is called organic solidarity. Organic solidarity is social cohesion based upon the dependence individuals have on each other in advanced societies. Although individuals perform different tasks and often have different values and interests, the order and solidarity of society depend on their reliance on each other to perform their specified and collective tasks. The term organic here is referring to the interdependence of the component parts.

**Conflict theory**

In contrast to functionalism, conflict theory is a social theory that posits that the distribution of resources between elements within a social system is the primary factor and determinant of the structure to that system. As such, it is focused on the unequal distribution of resources, arguing that individuals and groups within society have access to differing amounts of material and nonmaterial resources. Thus, the social structure that emerges out of this is seen to be essentially a mechanism for more powerful groups to use their resources in order to exploit groups with less power. According to the conflict perspective, society is made up of individuals competing for limited resources and this competition over scarce resources is at the heart of all social relationships.

Conflict theory emphasizes the role of coercion and power in producing social order. This perspective is derived from the works of Karl Marx, who saw society as fragmented into groups that compete for social and economic resources. Social order is maintained by domination, with power in the hands of those with the greatest political, economic, and social resources. Conflict theory sees society as a dynamic entity constantly undergoing change as a result of competition over scarce resources. Whereas functionalism understands society as a complex system striving for balance and stability, the conflict perspective views social life as competition that leads to change.

Of course, in reality, almost all social institutions are a combination of these two. They are both structure and function, both cooperation and conflict, static and dynamic, but by looking at these two extremes we can better understand the key drivers that make up the complexity of a social institution.

This model to institutions is equally applicable across all types and scale, from families to governments. For example, if we take the two dominant theories within international politics, structural realism, and liberal theory, we will see this recurring pattern. Structural realism posits that states live in an anarchic international system, a system where there is no higher authority, where you are vulnerable to attack from any other component in the system and due to this, states will strive for the greatest power, with all components being governed, but the structure of the distribution of power within the overall system. The liberal theory of international relations posits that, the fundamental ordering force within the international community is what is called complex interdependency that is the connections and interdependencies between the interests of all forms of groups within different societies.

We can see these two perspectives on international relations combine in people analysis of the current rise of China as a global power and its relation to the USA. Will the set of complex interdependencies between them prevail to make this a peaceful transition or do we still live in a component based international system where major change in its structure requires conflict, as conflict theory would tell us?

**Summary**

In summary, then, we have been taking a very high-level view of social intuitions through the lens of systems theory. We have tried to use this model of a system and efficiency to present an integrated picture that combines the two fundamentally different perspectives on their nature. We talked about what happens when we turn the system’s efficiency down, giving us a component based regime as described by conflict theory. The system becomes defined by the component's access to resources with ensuing relations of dominance that define a stratified structure where order is maintained by a top down control system. By then turning the efficiency up, we got the emergence of global functionality and a new regime as outlined by functionalism. It describes social intuitions as being primarily defined by the collective function they perform, with different elements in the system adapting their states towards this common outcome that binds them into a state of interdependency, creating social cohesion and order.

**Functions**

In a previous chapter, we talked about social institutions as subsystems within the overall society. We talked about how they provide both structure and function within the overall system. In this chapter, we will be focusing on the function that these social institutions perform. If we remember back to our definition for a system we defined it as a set of parts that are interrelated in performing some collective function, thus all systems perform some function. They take in resources of some kind and process those according to some set of instructions or rules in order to generate an output.

And this is, of course, the same for social systems. Within any given social system, a number of collective functions need to be performed for the system to be maintained and develop over time. These functions might include, basic biological reproduction of the population for which we have the institution of the family; or economic functions such as manufacturing products for which we have businesses; or political functions such as collective social decision making for which we have the institution of government.

All of these are social systems that have to aggregate individuals, assign functional roles to them. With all of these roles being integrated within some overarching process that takes in resources of some kind and performs an operation on them to produce some required output.

**Roles**

The division of functional tasks in a social system takes the form of the interaction among heterogeneous specialized positions, what we call roles. A social role defines a set of behaviors and activities of someone who holds a particular social status. Roles such as mother, manager or teacher constitute a set of responsibilities, expectations, norms, and behaviors that a person has to fulfill in order for the institution to function effectively. Roles define differentiated states that an individual must occupy in order for the organization to fulfill some collective function, as such they typically exist in relation to each other, what is called reciprocation roles, such as the role of doctor and patient, student and teacher, father and daughter etc.

**Relations**

In order to coordinate activity around some common function we need not only roles but some set of relations between these roles that define how they interrelate. Doctors and patients, students and teachers know how they should interrelate in order to enable the joint outcome. In larger social systems we have organization charts that define how the different positions relate to each other and within very formal situations they may define specific protocols for interaction, such as a soldier having to solute before interacting with a member of a higher rank or having to call the queen her majesty. But the primary objective here is to automate the interaction between the agents so that it does not have to be renegotiated each time. When everyone knows their role, place and how to relate to others within the system, this will enable frictionless processes to take place.

**Process & Instructions**

Next, in order for the system to perform some collective function we need to define what exactly that function is. If we think about writing a business model, we are really trying to define the functioning of that enterprise by answering the questions of what problem will this business solve, who will it solve it for, and what resources will it use to do that.

So systems take in inputs and through some process, they perform a set of operations on these inputs to generate some output. We could think about the military as an example, it will take in people, technology, finance and other resources in order to generate the desired functional output of securing a nation.

In order to do this there needs to be some set of rules that define how the whole process should be performed, thus formal social institutions are typically endowed with a set of instructions as to how their function should be conducted. For example, governments have a well-defined set of rules encoded in the constitution and law as to how they should conduct the process of governing a country, how decisions should get made, and what they can and can’t do during this process. The same would be true for an institute of education or even religion. These rules might be formal, as in these examples. Or they might be more informal, as we might have best practices within a business, or even within our culture, we have constructs of how an ideal family, friend, community etc. should be. This is essentially an informal set of rules as to how to perform that functional role what we might call a norm, the specific cultural expectations for how to behave in a given situation.

**Functional & Dysfunctional**

But of course, social institutions may also be dysfunctional. Political regimes may be corrupted, parents abusive or businesses inefficient. Robert King Merton, a twentieth-century sociologist, introduced the concept of dysfunctionality within social systems. Talking about religion, for instance, he pointed out the dysfunctional features of religion in a multi-religious society. In such a society religion, instead of bringing about solidarity, it could become the cause of disorganization and disunity, as it divides the community up, as such dysfunctionality is also seen to be disruptive to the stability of a social system.

As a concrete example of dysfunctionality, let's quote one commentator on Uganda’s government bureaucracy: “You have to marvel at the chutzpah of some government officials around here. Each day they commute to work only to spend most of their day seemingly reading the newspaper or out to lunch. Not such a bad gig if you can get it, even if the pay isn’t great! You can always top it up by demanding ‘express service fees’ to stamp the forms you’re supposed to stamp anyway“. We won’t take this comment too seriously, but it is a nice concrete illustration of endemic dysfunctionality. This dysfunctionality within systems theory is called entropy, which is a measure of the state of disorder within a system that can be correlated to its incapacity to do work or function.

According to Wikipedia, social entropy is “a macro sociological systems theory. It is a measure of the natural decay within a social system. It can refer to the decomposition of social structure … Much of the energy consumed by a social organization is spent to maintain its structure, counteracting social entropy, e.g., through legal institutions, education and even the promotion of television viewing. Anomie is the maximum state of social entropy. Social entropy implies the tendency of social networks and society, in general, to break down over time, moving from cooperation and advancement towards conflict and chaos.”

**Efficiency**

As we have previously discussed, because institutions serve some function, we can theoretically reason about the effectiveness with which they achieve this. The social system’s efficiency is how effectively it processes the input of resources to the output of some social function. The lower we turn down the efficiency, the more the system is being defined by its consumption of resources as opposed to its function - this consumption of resources within the system generates entropy. This is a bit like eating a banana. Once you have consumed it, you are left with a banana skin that you considered waste and that waste, which is entropy, has to be exported from the system. You through it in the bin and the bin is then taken outside to be disposed of. The more bananas you eat, the more banana skins are going to have to be thrown away somewhere. If those banana skins aren’t disposed of, they will pollute your local environment. That is to say, if you don’t export the entropy, it will degrade the functionality of the system.

**Dissipative systems**

We can describe this more formally with reference to what are called dissipative systems. The idea of a dissipative system was introduced to the scientific literature by the chemist and physicist Ilya Prigogine to describe thermodynamic systems, but it has come to be seen as applicable to all complex adaptive systems. We will be talking about complex adaptive systems in future chapters, but what is of relevance here is that closed systems obey the second law of thermodynamics, meaning there is an increase in entropy over time. A natural accumulation of increasing levels of random disorder. Dissipative systems and complex adaptive systems, like societies and institutions, avoid this natural decay process because they are open systems. They import energy and resources and they export entropy. If they are successful in doing this, they will be able to accumulate resources in order to either consume more or develop their internal structure to become more functional. Like a biological organism, ingesting food to grow larger, equally if they can not export this entropy then their internal structure will be degraded and thus their capacity to function equally degraded. How the social system manages to export entropy is then critical to understanding how it works and why it is the way it is.

But this idea of social entropy is of course very abstract in that it represents any form of disorder within a social system. The exporting of entropy then may be an individual's use of violence against another, or corruption that degrades the functionality of the overall organization.

And as we now understand entropy in terms of information, thanks to information theory, it can also be defined as lack of information or not knowing, thus lying to someone. The production of propaganda, manipulating information, these are all examples of exporting entropy. A person's misunderstanding of their environment can also be considered social entropy. We are clearly dealing with a very abstract concept here, but it does have a coherent theoretical and mathematical underpinning.

**Formal & Informal**

Social dysfunctionality is closely related to the subject of informal institutions. Institutions can be formal or informal. Informal institutions are largely organic, meaning they emerge naturally out of some preexisting substrate whenever there is a function to be performed, whereas formal intuitions are typically more artificial being designed by some set of explicit principles.

Formal institutions are made explicit and are socially excepted functions. For example, the family unit is a socially accepted functional unit, which is made formal and explicit by the process of marriage. But we also have functions within society that are not socially accepted and are thus not made formal, but at the same time they do not go away, they simply persist in an informal fashion. Prostitution might be an example here, the rules and roles to the workings of that institution are not made explicit and formalized, they remain latent.

Informal institutions can be used as a course of action which might not be publicly popular, or even legal, and can be seen as an effective way of making up for lack of efficiency in a formal institution. For example, in countries where formal institutions are particularly inefficient, an informal institution may be the most cost effective way of actually carrying out a given task. This ensures that there is little pressure on the formal institution to become more efficient. Our previous example of the government official improvising in offering ‘express service fees’ to stamp the forms may be an illustration of this.

The relationship between formal and informal institutions is often closely aligned and informal institutions step in to prop up inefficient institutions. Thus, when analyzing a given social system we should be aware of both the formal and informal institutions. Whereas they will typically present themselves as two contrasting systems, the reality is more often that informal institutions are created out of the failures of formal institutions and society's incapacity to accept and find solutions for integrating them into the overall social system. There is a symbiosis between the two. For example, in many countries, the law enforcement agencies do not try to remove possession or the consumption of cannabis but instead may actively work to maintain them in a particular state.

Social institutions have both manifest and latent functions. Manifest being those that are made explicit as the function of that institution, latent being those that are performed but not made explicit. For example, universities have the manifest function of teaching students the knowledge and skills necessary form some occupation, but universities also serve the latent function of socialization.

**Summary**

In this chapter, we have been talking about institutions as performing social functions. We talked about a number of components to this process including the need for functional roles, some defined set of relations between these roles, and their integration into some overall process that transforms an input to an output through a set of instructions - either formal or informal. We talked about how institutions may be dysfunctional, leading to the generation of social entropy, a state of disintegration and decay that needs to be exported in some fashion from the social system in order to maintain its structure and functionality. Finally, we talked about formal and informal institutions and the different social functions they perform. From basic demographics to economics to political and cultural. In the following chapter, we will be continuing with our discussion of social institutions when we look at them as forms of social structure for maintaining order and stability.

**Social Structure**

As a famous Swiss man once said: "Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains.” This short quote goes to the heart of one of the central phenomena of study within the social sciences. That is the idea of social order or structure and its relationship to agency, freedom and the capacity to change this social structure.

Social structures provide the paths and roads in our lives; they are the default positions that have already been created, the established institutions of culture, politics and the economy that enable us to go further, fast, easier, to do more. They enable us but they also constrain us, and they are the frameworks through which power is exercised. When we take these pathways we give over our agency and choices to travel along roads that have been created by someone else. Someone else is defining our choices along this path, and in so doing they have power over us.

**Social Structure**

In the social sciences, social structure is the patterns of social arrangements in society that are both emergent from and determinant of the actions and relations between agents. As enduring patterns of behavior and interaction, they define some form of order to the overall system. Social structures are typically complex and recurring patterns of organization. In contrast to social structure, social agency is the capacity of individuals to act independently and to make their own free choices. Because social structure is largely about order, it is often treated together with the concept of social change, which deals with the forces that change the social structure and the organization of society.

**Order**

Structures are really designed to facilitate order. Social change requires some form of individual initiative, so we have to ask how do we as individuals change the social structure around us? Here we see the interdependency between the two; we need structures that often constrain the individual but also we need individuals in order to test and change the structure for it to develop. We need order, rules, obedience and the structure that they bring but we also need individuals who will sometimes break and test those rules in order to make them manifest and help develop them.

**Types of Social Structure**

Social structure or organization is a product of agents coordinating their activities in some fashion. This coordination can only happen by the individuals giving over their agency, their choices, and actions to that organization. In people giving over their agency, they allow the organization to make decisions on their behalf; they submit to follow orders and become obedient to the organization's agenda.

Without this submission and coordination, we have no form of structure. It is only by police officers following orders that we can incarcerate people; it is only by people choosing to go to work every day that we get business organizations; it is only in our collective belief in money that it has value. So the question is then why do people give over their agency to organizations? Sociologies have really found three answers to this question. We do it either out of coercion, meaning we give up our choices because of the force others exert on us. Or we do it in exchange, meaning we bind ourselves into organizations because we perceive the benefits to us to be greater than the cost. Or we do it for normative reasons, meaning we form organizations and maintain them because we see it as a process through which to achieve a collective outcome that we value. Each of these different bases for giving over our agency creates very different social structures with different process of change. So we will go over each of them separately.

**Coercion**

Relations of conflict drive coercive organizations. Military dictatorships are classic examples of coercive organizations. Power is based on force; you give over your agency because ultimately of some fear that you have. As humans, we actually use physical violence very rarely in our interactions. Exercising violence is often a very last resort. What we do use though is intimidation, displays of power, manipulation, propaganda, neglect, acts of omission, etc. that are ultimately all trying to force one into adopting certain actions and out of this, we get some form of order and organization that is based on coercion.

**Hierarchy**

Inherent to the conflict theory of social order is that conflict is the normal state within a society, not the exception. This is most famously captured by Thomas Hobbes's book the Leviathan, where he posits that man, in a state of nature, is in a continuous war of all against all. Order is then seen to only be maintainable through some powerful centralized force.

This force is exercised through some hierarchical structure. As we have already discussed, relations of conflict give rise to a microstructure of one agent assuming a dominant position over another micro-dynamic of power and authority. One agent assumes greater control over the agency of the combined organization, while another assumes a subordinate position with a lower level of representation within the combined overall agency. As such, the social structure that emerges out of agonistic relations engenders varying degrees of inequality, within a stratified, hierarchical system where power is exercised in a downward direction in order to maintain the state or order of the system.

**Chain of Command**

Coercive social structures have strong rules and follow a strict chain of command through a hierarchal structure that represents a systematic way to integrate the activities of members with divergent agendas by having a clear line of command and thus automatic method for resolving conflicts. In order to control an organization in a hierarchical fashion, it has to be linearized. Nonlinearity is inherently uncontrollable through a hierarchical model. By linearizing I mean that you have to define a closed system, creating a boundary around it in order to regulate and constrain inputs and outputs to a relatively low level. Equally, you have to reduce the number of nonlinear interactions within the system, meaning you need information to be primarily flowing up and down the hierarchy not horizontally, because this would empower the agents on the lower levels of the organization and have a corrosive effect on the top-down exercise of control.

**Agency & Structure**

There is, of course, a strong dichotomy here between agent and structure. Within coercive organizations, individual agency is not some natural right that all members have. Members are typically stripped of individuality and forced to conform the culture is of strict obedience. Goals would be an example of this. Membership is not voluntary. The individual is stripped of their personal belonging and forced to wear identical clothes, they are identified by a number instead of by name, all of this is to reduce the diversity and individuality of the agents and facilitate their manipulation through the social structure. Agency is really derived from your place in the social structure. For example, within the feudal system, the individual had no inalienable rights, you got rights from your place in the social hierarchy, and there was very little social mobility.

**Change**

Conflict theory sees social change as only achievable through conflict. These coercive social systems are designed to serve the interests of those in the higher strata of the system. Below some level, in this hierarchy, the value of being part of the organization is less than it returns. People remain in these low positions because of coercion and dependency. This creates one subsystem that desires change, but above this theoretical line in the hierarchy, agents are receiving more than they are putting in through exploitation. This creates another subsystem that desires the maintenance of the social structure. The system then remains in it current confutation as long as the upper strata have sufficient power and the lower strata are sufficiently dependent. However, conflict theory goes on to add that this does not last forever. At some point, change happens though abrupt revolution.

**Utilitarian Organizations**

When agents give over their agency based upon their own perceived interests within an exchange system, we get what is called utilitarian organizations. People engage in this type of organization because they have something to gain. Thus the culture is one of productivity and efficiency. Legitimacy is based on the organization's or person's capacity to deliver in the exchange. Utilitarian organizations dominate modern societies. With the Enlightenment came the idea of reason and people as rational self-interested agents driven to maximize their utility. On this new understanding of the individual, we built a whole new set of social institutions that are utilitarian in nature. They are designed to provide people with as much return on their investment of time, energy, money or freedom as possible.

This is one way of understanding how economics and the idea of the market have become so domain within modern societies as an exchange mechanism for creating social order. A good example of a utilitarian organization would be a business. People consent to join and give over their agency to part of that organization in exchange for some remuneration. That is to say, they work in exchange for pay. When they feel this exchange is no longer of value to them, they can discontinue it. The idea of the social contract would be another example of this. The modern theory of the social contract propounds that individuals have consented, either explicitly or tacitly, to surrender some of their freedom and submit to the government, in exchange for protection of their remaining rights. We are exchanging the constraint of our actions for the agency that governments gives back to us in the form of rights that it will protect.

**Order & Change**

Order is maintained by a network of relations between the mutual self-interest of individuals and often regulated by some impartial third party that oversees the exchange. Like in a football match, we have the two competing parties, but we also have the referee to mediate this exchange and ensure rules that facilitate the exchange are upheld.

Utilitarian organizations are bureaucratic in nature. That is to say, an organizational model that is rationally designed to perform complex tasks efficiently. In a bureaucratic business or government agency, officials deliberately enact and revise policies to make the organization as efficient as possible. Legitimacy and status are based largely on one's capabilities and efficiency. Bureaucratic organizations are designed to be impersonal. There is a degree of abstraction between the role and the individual person that fulfills that role. There are formal methods to facilitate the change process, whether this is through election or some employment process.

This form of organization often involves decisions made through what is called an adversarial decision-making process. The use of a voting system to choose candidates to hold political office is an example of an adversarial decision-making process. This process requires each candidate to convince voters that they are more trustworthy and will be more effective in the role than their opponent. Everyone gets a vote in this process, but it does not require consensus. Whoever (Continued from page 53)

...gets the most votes wins, this process will sound very normal to us because it is used in many modern organizations.

**Normative Organizations**

Lastly, we will talk about normative organizations. People join normative organizations not out of coercion or self-interest but to pursue some goal they believe has value in itself. These include community service groups, political movements, many charities and we might include the new forms of collaborative network organizations we see emerging in post-industrial economies, such as open source software or Wikipedia. These organizations involve high levels of positive interdependence, making cooperation an attractor. These relations of positive interdependence create peer interactions of cooperation, with low levels of stratification in a more horizontal networked structure.

**Order & Agency**

Collaborative organizations emerge from self-governance because the individual is not joining out of coercion or self-benefit. They are in no way dependent upon it, they engage in the organization voluntarily, and thus the organization has no real power over them. Through self-governance, they have chosen to constrain themselves in order to coordinate with the group and achieve some collective outcome. Without this need to regulate and control the members, the organization can do away with much of the hierarchy within the first two forms of organization that was required to simply ensure people's compliance, meaning they can likely be much agiler.

Order is maintained through shared common commitment to some collective function. The organization is an emergent phenomenon of the individuals pursuing a goal or some interest that is of value to the overall system.

Within this form of organization, there is the possibility for consensus decision-making, which is a group decision-making process in which group members develop, and agree to support a decision in the best interests of the whole. It is used to describe the process of reaching a decision that is fully inclusive. Through self-governance, the individual's agenda is aligned with that of the whole, and in this way, we get integration between agency and structure. But it is only because the individual has created some internal structure of morals, values, ethics, etc. Thu,s they are called normative organizations because they are really governed by these personal normative values that people have developed to govern themselves personally. In this way, the governance structure is not something out there in some constitution or set of rules that need to be enforced; it is in the individual’s culture.

**Complexity**

We should remember that almost all real-world social systems will involve some combination of these three forms of basis to their structure and order. For example, many people go to work both out of a profit motive and because they believe in the value of what their organization is doing. Or if we take the military as another example, we might see all three forms. People may join the military out of a belief in the value of securing their nation but also for personal financial benefit. And once they are there, rules are enforced in a coercive fashion.

**Summary**

In summary, we have been talking about social structure and agents of change. We noted how these two phenomena of agency and structure are deeply interdependent with social structure emerging out of individuals giving over and combining their agency within organizations that both enable the individuals and constrain them.

We talked about the different types of social structure and how they can be modeled in terms of the condition under which the agents gave over their choices and actions. Starting on the most basic level of coercion that places an emphasis on structure over agency in a rigidly hierarchical organization resistant to change. Next, we talked about utilitarian organizations where agents partake in exchange relations based on mutual self-interest with the result being bureaucratic organizations focused on efficiency that have come to dominate modern industrial societies. Finally, we talked about the normative organizations we get when people voluntarily coordinate towards some collective outcome that is of normative value through an inclusive decision-making process.

**Nonlinear Social Science**

After chaos theory becoming accepted within mainstream science during the latter half of the previous century, nonlinear science is now set to play a major role in the 21st century. Interpreting nonlinear phenomena of all kind represents the forefront of contemporary research. And these ideas and models from nonlinear science are just starting to make their way into the social sciences. In this chapter of the book, we will be talking about nonlinear social science as we look at self-organization, feedback loops, chaos theory and social dynamics.

We will be firstly talking about self-organization as a process through which social patterns of organization are formed; we will discuss feedback loops and attractors as key features to this process. As we will see, self organization is essentially a process of integration, where we are going from a set of agents with random state correlations to synchronizing their states, giving us a distinct pattern of organization. Through this synchronization process driven by positive feedback loops, we get the emergence of patterns of order, as new cultures form, new social movements take hold, or new fashions are adopted.

We will then go on to talk about chaos theory as we look at symmetry breaking, bifurcations and the onset of chaos, which is in many ways the inverse process to self-organization, as we start with a homogeneous pattern but through these bifurcations and symmetry breaking we get the development of differentiated subsystems. As homogeneous cultures, social institutions and economies become increasingly specialized and differentiated during their development. Finally, in this chapter, we will talk about social dynamics and self-organized criticality as one model for understanding nonlinear social change.

Nonlinear systems as the name implies are defined by what they are not, and thus to get a basic understanding of the concept we need to define firstly what we mean by a linear system. Linear systems are defined by their adherence to what is called the superposition principles of homogeneity and additivity. Additivity simply means that the parts of a linear system can be added up to give us a description of the whole system. The whole is nothing more than the sum of its parts, thus linear systems theory is very much focused on giving an account of the individual elements in a system and their properties, being able to form an account of the whole by simply adding all the parts up. A thing to note here is that, because things are simply additive, and the whole is simply a summation of its parts, this means that the relations between the parts are of little significance, as they appear to add nothing of great value.

Homogeneity means that the inputs and outputs to a system are always proportional to each other. So for example, if we had twice as many teachers per student in a school, then if this was a linear system, we would have twice the level of student productivity. Linear systems are synonymous with simple systems. A simple linear social system would be one where the individuals have no special relation between them. As an example, we might think of a group of four people in an elevator. They are all strangers with no specific relation between them and thus the group is nothing more than the summation of its individual members. We can give an account of the whole group by simply listing the properties of the individuals.

By defying the superposition principles, nonlinear systems are then non additive. The whole is more than the sum of its parts due to the interactions between the parts. As we saw in the previous chapter, this derives from the synergies and interferences between the parts. They also defy the homogeneity principle, meaning the input and output to the system can change over time. The classical example being compound interest where the value that is being inputted each time is growing due to this compounding effect, leading to super-linear growth. We will be covering this in the next chapter as we talk about feedback loops and punctuated equilibrium.

(Continued from page 57)

**Self-Organization**

In this part of the book, we will be starting the major theme of nonlinearity and self-organization within social systems. We will use this chapter to give an outline to the overarching process of self-organization. Then, in future chapters, dig further into the different topics covered here.

**Self-organization**

Self-organization is a type of pattern formation, a means through which some form of order or coordination is developed. There are essentially just two basic methods through which social coordination and order can occur. Within linear systems, it may be imposed in a top-down fashion from some centralized global authority. Or within nonlinear systems, it may emerge from the interaction of the agents on the local level in a bottom-up fashion, and this is self-organization. As such, self-organization is a nonlinear process of pattern formation, meaning it is a product of distributed interactions.

**Top Down Order**

Within a linear system where there is a low level of connectivity and relatively few components interacting in a well-defined linear fashion, it is possible to control and coordinate that system through some centralized regulatory mechanism. We can use this centralized governance mechanism to impose or maintain order within the system. That is to say, by influencing or controlling the agent's choices towards a coordinated outcome we can get some state of order within the system.

We can only have this form of centralized, top-down coordination when a relatively large percentage of the interactions are being routed through some centralized coordination mechanism. But this top-down form of regulation and control is only possible within linear systems. As we turn up the distributed connectivity, the number of components and their capacity for autonomous decision making, the system will become more and harder to coordinate from a centralized location, and it will become easier and easier for patterns to form on the local level through this high level of distributed interaction. Above some theoretical point where we have more nonlinear distributed interactions than centrally controlled connections, we are starting to get a significantly large enough space that is unregulated, and it is in this unregulated space that has sufficient density of nonlinear interactions that self-organization can take hold as a significant mechanism for coordination.

**Bottom-Up**

Self-organization, in contrast to this linear top-down model, is a product of these local nonlinear interactions. When I bump into my neighbor on my way out in the morning and say “Hi“; this is an example of a local interaction. These local interactions are often spontaneous. As in this example, I didn't plan to meet my neighbor. It just happened. And they are nonlinear in the sense that they typically happen in a distributed fashion. I have chosen to say hi. I didn’t have to go and ask anyone for permission. This is a distributed peer-to-peer interaction, and these distributed local peer-to-peer interactions are very difficult to manage through a centralized model.

A centralized model will always have to use abstraction in order to manage the system because a centralized model means that very few people are trying to regulate very many. We can only do that by using abstraction. The president of a country with 1.3 billion people cannot go around telling each one what to do; there has to be many layers of bureaucracy between them. And information has to flow in a linear fashion out from the center to the periphery. The further we go out, the more people we have and the more possible cross links we can have between agents. Each one of these peer to-peer links is a possibility for a local pattern to form. So self-organization often happens out at the fringes where the chain of command is weak, and there are many local interactions. As a side note, today we see self-organization becoming more of a mainstream form of social coordination because we are increasing these distributed nonlinear interactions through Information technology, thus making it more difficult to manage these social systems through centralized methods. Either way, we can call this state an unregulated environment, and it is the condition or ground on which self-organization takes hold.

**Synchronization**

Self-organization is then a form of distributed nonlinear pattern formation. All patterns, forms of order, or organizations are going to involve some correlation between the states of the system’s constituent elements - this is essentially what an organization is. When there is no correlation, we have randomness, the absence of order.

So we have randomness and order which are some form of correlation between states, like two people dancing together. A change in the state of one's motion will be correlated with that of a change in another. The dancers, on a fundamental level, can really only do two different things. They can move together in the same direction, which is a positive correlation or they can move in the opposite direction, which is a negative correlation. A positive correlation means the two elements states are synchronized. They move together in the same direction. A negative correlation means they are desynchronized. They move in the opposite direction.

This dance then has what we would call a symmetry. This idea of symmetry is at the heart of modern mathematics. During the mid-eighteen hundreds, we came to understand algebra on a deeper level, concerning symmetric transformations and invariance. We have since gone on to use this within fundamental physics to understand the basic workings of our universe in terms of these transformations - because these symmetries and transformations apply to all forms of organizations.

As such, mathematics came to be understood by some as the study of patterns and that is what we are talking about with self-organization. Patterns of correlation between states that can be understood as symmetries. In applying this to social systems then, we are talking about agents, and thus we are talking about correlations between the choices of agents. Do they choose to do the same thing, opposing things or is there no correlation between their choices? This is the very basics of what we are dealing with when talking about self-organization within social systems.

**Feedback Loops**

Self-organization is then a process that is going to change the correlation between agent's states within the system. It is going to coordinate them, and this is done through what are called feedback loops. Positive feedback loops have been identified as playing a central role within the process of self-organization. We will be talking more about feedback loops in a future chapter, but a positive feedback loop is one that is self-reinforcing. The more products a business sells, the more it can invest in its business, meaning it can produce better, cheaper products, meaning it will sell more, meaning it can reinvest more and so on. This is an example of a positive feedback loop, it is a nonlinear process of change, through it the business can grow in an exponential fashion.

Feedback loops are the mechanisms through which some small local event, which is often random in nature, can get amplified into a new macro level pattern of organization and this is the heart of the whole process of self-organization.

To give an illustration of this, let's think about a beach of people sunbathing on their holidays. Now let's add some initial random event. We have someone with headphones on listening to their favorite music, and they get so excited that they jump up and start dancing around. What happens now depends on the state of the other agents around them. Typically these random events will get dampened down and die out. Everyone will look at this guy like "he is weird." But by this person occupying this differentiated state, we have already created a feedback loop. It is now much easier for anyone else with a propensity for dancing to jump up and join him, and when they do, we now have some distinct pattern. Two people occupying the same state and although they are still a significant minority the positive feedback has got stronger. It is now even easier for the next person to join. And with every new person that joins, it becomes more attractive for anyone else to do likewise.

**Attractors**

As this positive feedback process of change continues, we will get to some point where there are more people dancing than not dancing. At this point, dancing has become what we would call an attractor. You will be considered more normal if you are dancing rather than not dancing. If we add a new agent to this system who just wants to be normal and follow the course of least resistance, then he or she will end up dancing.

And thus through this process (Continued from page 62)

of change driven by positive feedback, we now have an attractor. A default set of states within the system. This attractor is the pattern of organization, all these agents dancing have correlated their states in some way. As another example of an attractor, we might think about the languages and cultures within different regions. Within any different region, there will be a strong attractor towards speaking the same language and adopting the same culture. Behind the creation of these cultural attractors was a positive feedback loop, the same as with our people on the beach.

But as we know, there are many different languages and cultures in our world representing many different attractors. Because if the system is large enough, this process of self-organization through positive feedback may take hold around many different components within the system at different locations and grow out from there until it reaches another pattern at which point we get a boundary condition. Like the national boards in Europe marking the limits to the different cultural attractors that have formed over a prolonged period of time. At this point, where all the elements in the system are aligned within local level attractors, positive feedback will die out and negative feedback will take hold as the different attractors balance each other out to create a semi-stable configuration.

**Externalities**

These different attractors then have to compete or cooperate in order to enable some form of global coordination. This type of interaction will largely be a product of how the attractors were created in the first place. That is to say, were these different local attractors created out of exclusive or inclusive conditions. We can create social organization by having individuals overcoming their differences in finding common ground, common purpose and identity. Or we can create this organization by defining our difference and degrading others, what is called "out-group derogation", which is a form of negative externality. In this case, we are creating the pattern of organization by simply exporting the entropy outside of the system’s boundary to some other system. For example, the Nazis created their sense of identity around the Aryan race through a systematic derogation of other out-groups, including the Jews among others. This exporting of social entropy creates division and conflict.

By the individual attractors exporting entropy, this will create a state of disorder within the overall system. Any group that (Continued from page 62/63)

...is dependent upon the exporting of entropy in order to define and maintain its internal state of order, will not be able to integrate within the overall state space and conflict will be the primary type of interaction between the different patterns of organization. 

**Emergence** 

But of course, this is not always the case. We can also get positive externalities. The net result being emergence as the different local attractions overcome their differences and we get the emergence of some global pattern of organization. Emergence is a process whereby larger entities, patterns, and regularities arise through interactions among smaller or simpler entities that themselves do not exhibit such properties. As such, it is very much analogous to self-organization but subtly different. 

Emergence is a distinctly nonlinear phenomenon in that it can not be derived from any one component within the system. It is the product of many distributed interactions across the system. An example of this might be a wave at a football match. This is an emergent self-organizing phenomenon, no one is coordinating it. Some small initial event takes hold and gets amplified into a large macro phenomenon; it emerges out of the synchronized states of the members. People crossing a street is another example of pattern emergence through self-organization. We have dense interactions as people going in either direction try to pass each other, those who meet first have to coordinate their activity, but once they do this will create an attractor for others to follow as we get the emergence of some pattern to the crowd, streams of people going in different directions. 

**Cause & Effect** 

In these nonlinear systems, there is a breakdown of linear cause and effect. If I hit a ball with a bat and you ask me why the ball moved off in the direction it did, I can say "because I hit it with the bat." This is linear causality, and I can predict the next time I hit the ball with the bat, it will again move in the opposite direction. But this is not the case with nonlinear dynamics. The effect of self-organization, that is to say, the output of the system, is not a product of the input. It is an emergent phenomenon of the overall state of the system and the feedback loops over time. 

Almost all real world complex systems are going to have randomness, fluctuations, and noise in them. Nothing is perfectly ordered. But these small events typically do not affect the overall pattern of organization. If we take any large enough society, there will always be some people who are discontent with the current state of the socio-political system and trying to change it. But they will typically not gain traction, thousands or even millions of small events will take place without any effect, because of the overall state of the system. 

But when all the components come to be aligned within a similar configuration; all the agents come to adopt a similar perspective; then some small event can gain traction and propagate through the whole system. For example, we might think about some oppressive political regime. For every act of oppression from the ruler, this may not have a direct consequence, but it creates resentment among the people. This resentment builds up until we have some critical state. All the people are synchronized in their discontent. At this point, some small random phenomena, which had happened many times before, can now propagate through the system rapidly. The system has self-organized into a critical state, and this critical state is systemic - it is distributed out across all the elements in the system. Thus no one cause created the effect. It emerged out of the overall state of the system and the feedback loops that drove it over time. 

**Predictability** 

This type of nonlinear pattern formation is then unpredictable. There are many small fluctuations, and it can not be determined in advance which one will gain hold. Thus, we cannot know where they will come from because the actual event emerges out of the state of the system and through the feedback loops. But those feedback loops play out over time after the event has happened. That is to say, the outcome does not exist at inception, it is not determined by the initial cause but instead, it is created along the way. 

The academic Journal of Democracy, describes this phenomenon as such: “Regime transitions belong to that paradoxical class of events which are inevitable but not predictable. Other examples are bank runs, currency inflations, strikes, migrations, riots, and revolutions. In retrospect, such events are explainable, even overdetermined. In prospect, however, their timing and character are impossible to anticipate. Such events seem to come closer and closer but do not occur, even when all the conditions are ripe—until suddenly they do.“ 

**Summary** 

In summary, we have been talking about self-organization as a nonlinear process of pattern formation. That requires dense distributed peer-to-peer interactions within an unregulated environment in order to take hold. We discussed social organization as a form of correlation between agent's choices, how randomness can be equated to the lack of correlation whereas order may be understood in terms of symmetries. We talked about how positive feedback loops are the key engines behind self-organization as they can work to amplify some small event into a large systemic phenomenon, creating local attractors that then have to cooperate or compete to get global coordination. 

Finally, we saw how linear cause and effect breaks down within these nonlinear systems, phenomena emerge out of the distributed state of the system and the feedback loops over time, making events fundamentally unpredictable in nature. 

**Synchronization** 

The mathematician Steven Strogatz talks about synchronization as such – “sync is maybe one of… the most pervasive drives in all of nature. It extends from the subatomic scale to the furthest reaches of the cosmos. It’s a deep tendency towards order in nature that opposes what we’ve all been taught about entropy…(it is) the tendency towards spontaneous order.” 

In continuing with our main theme of self-organization within social systems, in this chapter, we will be digging further into the very basic elements of this process as we discuss synchronization and causal links. Any form of organization within a social system is going to derive ultimately from agents assuming, either by choice or necessity, some coordination between their activities and agendas. We get riots, financial transactions, families, governments, tennis clubs and all forms of social systems because untimely agents have come to assume some correlation between their states and activities. 

As we previously touched upon, there are just three different types of correlation. Firstly, we can have a random correlation, meaning there is no relation between the variables, they are independent. Secondly, we can have a positive correlation, meaning the values associated with the different elements move in the same direction. Lastly, we can have a negative correlation, where the two variables move in different directions. So we will go over each of these to understand how they relate to nonlinearity. 

**Random Correlation** 

When agents act completely independently, we will get a random correlation between their states. For example, me choosing to go to the swimming pool on Friday has absolutely no correlation to whether my neighbor will go shopping the following Monday. These two events are randomly correlated. Randomness is the lack of pattern or predictability in events. A random sequence of events, symbols or steps has no order and does not follow an intelligible pattern or combination. Individual random events are by definition unpredictable, but in many cases, the frequency of different outcomes over a large number of events is predictable. 

For example, if we took a large enough group of people and randomly assigned connections between them, and then went and plotted a graph of how many connections each person had, we would get a normal or Gaussian distribution, where some would have few connections, some many, but most would tend towards the average. And the more connections we added, the closer we could predict what this average would be. This is called the Law of Large Numbers. If this is truly a random system, any individual event is perfectly random, totally unpredictable, but as we go to the limit of infinity we get an outcome that is perfectly predictable. Thus, the further we go towards infinity, the more it will tend towards this predictable outcome. But this is only because there is no correlation, but the fact is that most things that we are interested in are not random. 

**Negative Correlations** 

If the values are negatively correlated, we have what is called a negative causal link within system dynamics. A negative link is a relationship between two variables where they change in the opposite direction, such that, as the value of one variable increases, the other decreases and vice versa. An example of this might be the financial relationship between the owner of a business and the employees. If all other things are equal, the more the owner pays the employees, the less profit for the owner. Thus elements within this type of relationship are going in the opposite direction creating a counterbalancing dynamic. 

**Mean Field Theory** 

These first two types of relations we have outlined are linear. Meaning that the gains to one agent are balanced by the losses to another. It is linear because when everything is added and subtracted it sums up to zero. If we take the distribution and make one side positive and the other side negative, when we add all the samples up they will sum to zero. Because of this nice even normal distribution, we can collapse it all down to the average value, this method is most explicit and well formulated within what is called Mean Field Theory. 

Mean Field Theory comes from physics and in particular statistical mechanics where researchers are dealing with many interacting variables, such as gas molecules in a chamber. The main idea of mean field theory is to replace all interactions to any one body with an average interaction. This reduces any multi-body problem into an effective one-body problem. The ease of solving MFT problems means that some insight into the behavior of a complicated system can be obtained at a relatively low cost. 

This model has been adopted within game theory giving us mean field game theory, which is the study of strategic decision making in very large populations of small interacting individuals. This approach will work in many social scenarios whenever we have these two first forms of correlation - differences nicely cancel one another out and we can use some form of the mean field theory. For example, consider tracking the behavior of a swarm of bees. If you observe any one bee in the swarm, its behavior is pretty erratic. Making an exact prediction of that bee’s next location is nearly impossible; however, keep your eye on the center of the swarm—the average—and you can detect a fairly predictable pattern. In such worlds, assuming behavior embodied by a single representative bee who averages out the flight paths of all of the bees within the swarm both simplifies and improves our ability to predict the future. And this is the nature of simple linear systems, where reductionism will often work well as an approximation. We can reduce things down to a single homogenous state variable, but this does not work in nonlinear systems. 

**Positive Links** 

Positive causal links between values associated with different elements mean they both move in the same direction. Thus, if one variable increases, the other one also increases or if one decreases the other also decreases. Positive links represent relations of deep interdependency, everyone wins or losses together. We get this positive link by two things interacting in either a constructive fashion meaning they both increase or a destructive fashion meaning they both decrease. 

By constructive, we mean the two variables are moving in the positive direction. By two countries signing a trade agreement, their two economies may grow and this is essentially a synergistic interaction. By both increasing together, they are adding value to the overall system. Inversely, with a destructive interaction, the two variables move in the downward direction together. An arms race between tow nations might be an example of this. Through this interaction, the value of the whole system is decreasing. This may be called a negative synergy or interference in the way that two sound waves can cancel each other out making the combined output to the system less than a simple summation of its inputs. 

This illustrates how these positive links are nonlinear. When we add and subtract the gains and losses to all agents in the interaction, they do not sum to zero thus defying the additivity principle. This nonlinear nature to positive links makes these phenomena less well studied and understood. Wherever we have synergies or interference within a social system, we will get nonlinearity. This might be the synergy between two partners in a relationship, between tow businesses engaged in a merger or different countries collaborating on cross-border security. Tt might be the negative synergy between tow sides in a civil war, two companies competing on advertising, two cultures that contradict each other. These nonlinear phenomena are ubiquitous in our world. 

**Feedback Loops** 

Feedback loops are central to the dynamics of nonlinear systems of all kind, from financial crisis to population growth, to ecosystem collapse to the outbreak of conflict. They are the engines of self-organization, they are what drives the process as it develops over time. In this chapter, we will be digging deeper into their workings as we talk about tipping points, thresholds path dependency and punctuated equilibrium. 

**Nonlinear Dynamics** 

Feedback loops describe a relationship of interdependence over time, meaning what happens now is going to affect what happens in the future and out of this feedback and interdependence of states over time we will get a certain pattern of development. So these feedback loops are not taking place between agents or groups at the same time but now represent relations over a period of time as the system changes and thus we are dealing with system dynamics. In the model of a linear system, their is an input to the system that generates some output, but this output does not affect its future input. Because of this, the homogeneity principle holds. That is, that the input and output to the system remain constant over time, so that things grow or decay in a linear fashion 2,4,6,8 etc. This type of linear development is really the product of independence between states over time. This model is like a business that never gets any better it simply stays doing the same thing year after year. 

But as we know, in the real world, many social phenomena of change are not like this, they involve feedback loops over a period of time. What happens in the past, feeds into effect what happens now and what happens now will feed into effect the future. Through this, we can get a compounding effect as things build on top of themselves. Our business can actually get better at what it does every year so that the input-output ratio to the system will not stay constant. 

**Types of Feedback** 

Feedback systems define how an event may feedback on itself over time, and what we are interested in is whether what feeds back will make the system do more of what it did in the past or less. This will be definitive in its overall pattern of development, as we will discuss. When what happened in the past feeds into making the system do more of what it did previously, then this is a positive feedback loop. Everything is moving together in the same direction over time. With negative feedback loops, the values move in the opposite direction. If we have more of something now, we will have less of it in the future. Thus these negative feedback relations over a period of time will lead to stability, and little change as what one does now is counterbalanced with what happens in the future. 

Positive feedback loops are drivers of nonlinear exponential growth or decay within a system. The output of the system now is feedback in as the input to the future state of the system thus the system can build upon itself over a period of time - there is a compounding effect. The classical example of this being compound interest, the current output value of the account is fed into the future calculation where interest is added to it, this larger amount is then fed into the next cycle with the same rate of interest now acting on a larger figure thus producing a large growth rate. The thing to note here is that it is not just that the amount of money is growing, it is more important that the amount that is being added each iteration is itself growing because of the compounding positive feedback relations over time. 

**Examples** 

Feedback loops are an example of the premise of complexity theory that complex phenomena can be the product of simple rules. Almost all phenomena that you would consider not normal are nonlinear. Positive feedback loops are present in many processes of change within social systems. Just to make this more concrete, we will go over a number of examples. 

**Riots** 

A social riot would be an example of positive feedback. When a riot begins with few people these individuals are vulnerable. But with every extra person that chooses to partake in the riot, it makes it more likely that it will be successful and less like that any one individual will be reprimanded. Thus, more will beget more as this positive feedback cascades through the individuals aligning their states. 

**Conflict** 

Conflict escalation can involve positive feedback. Given some act of aggression, an opposing agent will be threatened, becoming less tolerant and more likely to react, which will in turn feedback to effect the same action on the behalf of the other. An example of this would be an arms races between two nations, where the two sides continue to try and outcompete the other leading to all losing and growing potential for conflict. 

**Irrational Exuberance** 

Likewise, the phenomena of irrational exuberance is another example of a positive feedback. When the value of a trader's stock goes up, this feeds back to boost the trader's self-confidence in their decision making and encourages them to make more investments that may be even riskier. 

**Inequality** 

Another good example would be what is called the Matthew effect within sociology, which describes the fact that advantage tends to beget further advantage. Thus this phenomenon is also known as the rich get richer as these feedback loops tend to increase initial inequalities. We might think about the fact that bank managers are more likely to lend money to people who already have lots of money. Likewise, those who are already well connected within society will have greater potential for making more influential connections. This accumulative effect is described within network science by the concept of preferential attachment, which explains that those nodes that initially acquire more connections than others will increase their connectivity at a higher rate, and thus an initial difference in the connectivity between two nodes will increase further as the network grows. 

We can see how this phenomenon of accumulative advantage may lead to greater polarization and of course a polarized social system means higher potential for conflict. This may be an example of what is called self-organizing criticality that we will discuss in a future part. 

**Phase Transitions** 

So whereas negative feedback within a linear system will give us linear incremental change, that is to say, a simple quantitative change, positive feedback will give us a qualitative change. And this makes sense because control systems that use negative feedback are specifically designed to maintain a system within a certain set of parameters to enable its stable functioning, whereas nonlinearity is going to take the system outside of these parameters, thus discontinuing that state of functionality and requiring it to operate in a new fashion. This type of nonlinear growth is a very powerful force that is clearly unsustainable. It can not continue indefinitely; it will eventually drive the system out of its current regime. 

Whereas linear development may maintain the system within its current attractor, exponential growth through positive feedback drives the system far-from-equilibrium and is a key characteristic of a system going through what is called a phase transition. Phase transitions represent periods of critical and rapid change within a system's development. The parameters with which we define the system change fundamentally. The melting of ice into water is an example of a phase transition. We get a sudden transformation, and a regime shift as water is a very different substance to solid ice. 

Examples of phase transitions within social systems might include the fall of the Berlin Wall. Before this rapid critical phase transition, the global political environment was largely defined by a bipolar regime. Before the fall, this bipolar model was the parameter we used to define the system. After the event, the political environment was described with reference to a new set of parameters relating to globalization. The Arab Spring might be another example. The Arab Spring is widely believed to have been instigated by dissatisfaction with the rule of local governments. After many decades of the Middle East being held within a particular configuration or political regime, the Arab Spring was a punctuation of this equilibrium. That previous regime was a set of negative feedback loops that balanced the system into some equilibrium. We might say there was some balance of power, but this balance got broken through some small fluctuation, the self-sacrifice of a street vendor in Tunisia. This small event then got amplified by positive feedback into a large systemic transformation. Through this positive feedback, the balance of power was broken temporarily and the political system across the Middle East moved into a phase transition. 

**Tipping points** 

This process of self-organization involves what are called tipping points. Within sociology, a tipping point is understood as a point in time when a group of agents—or a large number of group members—rapidly and dramatically changes its behavior by widely adopting a previously rare practice. The phrase was introduced to sociology by Morton Grodzins. Grodzins studied racial integration within american neighborhoods in the early 1960s. He discovered that most of the white families remained in the neighborhood as long as the comparative number of black families remained very small. But, at a certain point, when "one too many" black families arrived, the remaining white families would move out en masse in a process known as white flight. He called that moment the "tipping point." Tipping points are the product of agents having thresholds that have to be met before they will act, and there is clearly a feedback loop at work here, every time an agent reaches a tipping point and acts, this makes it more likely that another will also. 

So for example, if we take two groups of people and each individual has a propensity to adopt some new phenomena as seen described by: 0, 1, 2, 2, 2 & 1, 1, 1, 2, 2. Then, we will notice that the first group will adopt the new phenomena as soon as it is introduced because the lowest threshold within that group is zero and once that person adopts then the next person at one will do likewise and then the rest. But the other group will not become adopters because they require one person before they will change. 

The thing to note here is that both groups have the same average propensity for adoption, both groups as a whole are equally as receptive to this new phenomenon. We can then see that the average or normal is not important; it is the outliers that matter. You have to know the distribution or variance and how they are connected. With more people in the tail, you are more likely to get a collective action. 

And thus we can say that within these nonlinear systems it is the tail that wags the dog. Because of heightened connectivity and interdependence, major new phenomena start at the fringes and then through positive feedback build up and make their way into affecting the mainstream. 

**Punctuated Equilibrium** 

A combination of negative and positive feedback loops during the development of a system can lead to a model of development called punctuated equilibrium. Punctuated equilibrium is a model first derived from evolutionary biology but has also been applied to social theory as a method for understanding change in complex social systems. This model looks at the evolution of social change, suggesting that most social systems exist in an extended period of stasis, which are later punctuated by sudden shifts of radical change. Social systems are characterized by long periods of stability, where negative feedback loops work to maintain an equilibrium holding them within a well-structured attractor state. This is then punctuated by large—though less frequent—societal shifts, driven by a positive feedback loop that drives the system far-from-equilibrium and out of its current attractor into a new one. During a phase transition, that represents a new regime and new equilibrium under a new set of negative feedback loops. 

**Path Dependence** 

This dynamic to nonlinear systems creates path dependency, which explains how the set of states to a system now are limited and defined by the historical trajectory that led to this point in time. That is to say, complex social systems bare their history on their shoulders. Time reversibility only holds for some linear systems, but nonlinear systems are non-time reversible. The development of the system goes in one direction with respect to time. Because of feedback loops, the system is within a particular attractor because of the choices made in the past. 

An example of this we could cite might be the clustering of businesses. Similar businesses tend to congregate together geographically; opening nearby similar companies that attract workers with expertise in that business domain. This then draws in more businesses in search of experienced workers. This network effect is driven by positive feedback loops and negative externalities that have taken the system down a particular pathway into a particular basin of attraction from which it would be difficult to exit or change. 

**Summary** 

In this chapter, we have been talking about feedback loops as a key component to self-organization within nonlinear systems. We briefly outlined the workings of positive feedback loops that work to accelerate change, and negative feedback that works to dampen down change, constraining the system towards a stable state. We looked at a number of example of positive feedback, talked about tipping points and thresholds that create abrupt cascading processes of change. 

We saw how these positive feedback loops can be a powerful force that, if left unchecked, will take the system out of its current overall state and into a phase transition as it moves into a new regime, with this model giving us a pattern of development that is marked by prolonged periods of stability that are punctuated by these rapid phase transitions. 

**Attractor and Chaos** 

When we look at many different types of social systems, we see distinct patterns of clustering - distinct substructures that have synchronized their states. If we look, for example, at the distribution of ethnic groups across many multicultural cities, we will see these distinct recurring clustering patterns to the different cultures. We would also see this clustering within the distribution of political opinions across the different regions of some country, or again the clustering of traditional dialects. None of these forms of organization have been planned by a central authority. They are all examples of emergent phenomena. All of these different clustering patterns are examples of attractors which are central to understanding the process of pattern formation within nonlinear systems. 

**State space** 

An attractor is a set of states towards which a system will naturally gravitate and remain cycling through unless perturbed. For any system we can create what is called a state space, that is all the possible states that the system might take. A state space also called a phase space is a mathematical model in which all possible states of a system are represented, with each possible state of the system corresponding to one unique point in the phase space. 

To build this state space model, we have to define one or more parameters to the system that we are interested in, where a parameter is simply a measurement of something about the system. So if we were interested in a sales person’s finances, we could define a parameter, to measure their income, but this would not be very interesting, it would simply go up and down depending on their sales. So what we are typically interested in then is the relationship between two or more different parameters. So we might define another parameter to their overall savings or wealth. Now at each day, we will take a sample of both of these parameters, putting a dot at the corresponding value and stay doing this over a period of time. 

What we will see after doing this for a few weeks is some kind of typical behavior, during the week they are earning some amount, then it goes up on Saturday with lots of sales but then down on Sunday when they are not working and then starts again the next week. What we will typically see is that these different states do not go around every single state in the whole space, but are confined to a limited subset of all the possible states. So we can say that this subset of the phase space (Continued from page 78)

...of the dynamical system corresponding to its typical behavior is the attractor.

A bowl containing a ball may be used to illustrate the concept. The ball will move around the bowl until eventually, it comes to rest at the lowest point. We can say that it is 'attracted' to that point, so each part of the bowl can be regarded as leading to that stationary point, and the whole bowl is what we call the system's basin of attraction.

Systems, like this ball, are typically held within their attractor because of the different forces placed upon them by their environment. An animal stays on a particular patch of fertile land and does not stray too far from it because it needs to eat; a person gets up and goes to work every day because they need the money to support themselves. What is happening here is that these dynamical systems are dissipative, meaning they need some source of energy to maintain their dynamic state. They are continuously inputting new energy and then dissipating it, and they cycle through this process always having to come back to the source of energy that is maintaining their dynamic state. It is in that cycling that we get all the different states within the attractor.

**Social Attractors**

Within social systems, we can think of attractors as representing the course of least resistance for a person or social group at any given time. They remain within their current configuration because of inertia. Due to these counter balancing forces that are on the system within its basin of attraction, it can be said to be in a state of equilibrium.

For example, an attractor may represent a social institution of some kind; social institutions serve some function for individuals and society, they are essentially patterns of behavior or belief that exist within a given society in order to serve basic human functions. Institutions represent pre-existing solutions to given social challenges both personal and social. As such, they are the course of least resistance for individuals within that society. Working for an existing company is typically easier than creating one's own. Adopting the values of one's society is typically much easier than reading a big pile of philosophy books to figure out one's own beliefs and values. These attractors then keep social (Continued from page 79)

actors within a well-defined set of behaviors and some equilibrium state. 

**Bifurcation**

The word "bifurcation" means splitting or cutting in two. If a river divides into two smaller streams, that's a bifurcation. If you split a company into two divisions, that's a bifurcation too. Mathematicians have borrowed the term bifurcation to describe how a system branches off into a new qualitatively different long-term state of behavior. What we are interested in here is really a bifurcation in these attractors, so instead of having just one attractor in our state space, a bifurcation will now give us two attractors, and that means two stable sets of states that the system may cycle through. 

To help us understand what this might mean, let's think about the French Revolution as an example, in particular, what is called the tennis court oath which was a pivotal event during the first days of the French Revolution. When Third Estate, after being locked out from the government, made a makeshift conference room inside a nearby tennis court, calling themselves the National Assembly they, went on to form the new political republic of France. 

Prior to this event, we had a single attractor within the political state space to the nation. It was an absolute monarchy. All political activity was beneath and in relation to the monarch. This tennis court oath was then a bifurcation in the topology as a new attractor formed. 

**Symmetry Breaking**

Any agent within this state space after the bifurcation is going to have to choose one of the attractors. Whereas previously before this bifurcation everyone was under the same political regime of the monarch, that is to say, everyone had a symmetric homogeneous state, but now that we have two attractors people have to choose one state or another, and this is called symmetry breaking. 

Symmetry breaking is a phenomenon in which critical points decide a system's fate by determining which branch (Continued from page 79)

of a bifurcation is taken. Such transitions usually bring the system from a symmetric but disorderly state into one or more definite states. As such, symmetry breaking plays a major role in pattern formation, as we are now getting differentiation and some form of organization, that is to say, that there is now some relationship between these different parts. 
 
To continue with our previous example, this symmetry breaking would correspond to you having to choose to side with the monarch or the new parliament. Once you have made this choice, you are now within one of the two basins of attraction. You have differentiated your state with respect to others. And out of everyone going through this symmetry breaking, we will start to get a new pattern of organization forming. 
 
As another example, we might think about the massive cultural revolution that took place within Western society as we moved into the modern era. Prior to the scientific revolution and The Enlightenment, this society was based on the homogeneous belief system of the Catholic church. With the scientific, secular vision of the world, we had a bifurcation in this cultural state space and, ever since, we have had many more bifurcations until today. We now live in multicultural societies, with many different religions, philosophies and belief systems. An individual growing up in this society is no longer held within a single basin of attraction, they are free to choose from a number of different attractors. 
 
**Onset of Chaos** 
 
This bifurcation and symmetry breaking process is pervasive across many different types of systems. This process is most clearly expressed in what is called the logistic map, which is an iterative function, meaning we take the output at each iteration and feed it back into calculating the next value. Such as with population growth, where we take the previous population and feed it into the iterative function to calculate the current population, and then that again will feed into the next iteration and so on. 
 
We will not go into the details of this logistic map, but what it tells us is that there is what is called a period doubling in the rate of bifurcation. After we have this initial bifurcation, we then get more bifurcations happening faster, doubling in rate each period and this is called the onset of chaos as we are moving towards a state of more and more attractors, great and great differentiation. 
 
This is one way of understanding complex systems. On the left-hand side of this graphic of the logistic map, we have systems with a single equilibrium, which is characteristic of simple linear systems. We then have a bifurcation as we get the emergence of two attractors. From here on, we get the period doubling with more and more attractors emerging and this is the chaotic regime of nonequilibrium complex systems that have multiple basins of attraction and can flip between them. And this is one way of understanding what is called chaos, where chaos means sensitivity to initial conditions, two things that started out almost exactly the same, diverge and ultimately end up in totally different basins of attraction. No matter how close together two states were initially and no matter how long their trajectories remain close together, at any time they can suddenly diverge going in completely different directions. 
 
Going back to our previous example about the development of Western society, we might think about how, at the beginning of the modern era, we were all relatively economically, socially and culturally similar. Economically, almost all of us were manual laborers working the land, culturally we all believed in the same belief system that guided and controlled all social institutions. 
 
Through the process of modernization, both our cultures, society, and economies have become increasingly specialized and differentiated. Culturally, we have developed a vastly more complex body of knowledge for interpreting our world. Our social institutions have become decoupled from the church to gain autonomy, and of course, economically we have become highly specialized and differentiated within our skills and occupations. This social system that started our relatively homogeneous has gone through many bifurcations, and symmetry breaking to become a heterogeneous complex system with many different attractors. 
 
**Summary** 
 
In this chapter, we have been talking about attractors and the fundamental role they play within social dynamics, both with respect to self-organization and chaos. We firstly gave an outline to the model of a state space, that allows us to quickly identify recurring patterns within a system's long-term behavior. We talked about how these dissipative systems typically only occupy a small subset of the overall space as they cycle through some set of states relating to an underlying process of energy consumption and dissipation. And it is this subset of states that we called the attractor, that may be interpreted as an agent's path of least resistance. We discussed bifurcations as a topological transformation that results in the emergence of two different attractors, requiring agents to adopt a specific state within either attractor, resulting in the process of symmetry breaking. Lastly, we saw how this process of continuous doubling in bifurcations is a universal feature of systems as they move into a chaotic and complex regime consisting of multiple attractors and multiple equilibria. 
 
**Edge of Chaos** 
 
The idea of social order and chaos has fascinated people from many different domains for millennia, but these very big ideas have remained largely outside the scope of modern science. With our analytical and reductionist methods, we never really had the conceptual means with which to approach these very abstract concepts. As we have previously discussed, we have some tools within mathematics and fundamental physics (some of the ideas we have been discussing around symmetry and symmetry breaking), but they never really generalized to outside of these domains. With the rise of chaos theory and complexity, we have started to get the very bare outlines of some form of a language for approaching these very fundamental questions. 
 
Chaos theory has given us a basic understanding of how systems turn chaotic, and with the study of synchronization, we are getting a basic language with which to approach this topic. We can now ask questions about how things come into and go out of synchronization and, of course, our growing understanding of self-organization is also central to this enterprise. With the theory of self-organized criticality and catastrophe theory (that we will be touching upon in a future chapter), we are again starting to get real quantitative models as to how these macro-level processes of change between order and chaos play out. 
 
**Edge of Chaos** 
 
The phrase edge-of-chaos was coined by mathematician Doyne Farmer to describe the phenomenon discovered by computer scientists of a small area conducive to producing cellular automaton capable of universal computation. In the sciences in general, the phrase has come to refer to a metaphor that some physical, biological, economic and social systems operate in a region between order and either complete randomness or chaos, where the complexity is maximal. And this is one way of interpreting the idea of complexity. Complexity can not be understood in terms of simple symmetries, but it is also not random, it is some combination of both and this is why our traditional scientific methods have had such problems dealing with it. 
 
This generative complexity takes place in the boundary between rigidity and randomness. Historically, science viewed “change” as moving from one equilibrium state to another. Newtonian understandings could not cope with the random, near-chaotic messiness of the actual transition itself. Ecologists and economists similarly favored equilibrium conditions because neither observation nor modeling techniques could handle transition states. The relatively inexpensive computational power of modern computers has changed all that. Non equilibrium and nonlinear simulations are now possible. These developments, along with the study of complexity, have enabled us to better understand the dynamics of this “messiness” on the edge of chaos that is a lot more representative of what our world actually looks like and what social systems look like. 
 
**Phase Transition Space** 
 
Too much order and change will not cross impermeable boundaries. Too much chaos and the system loses its organization. It is thought then that complex adaptive systems maintain themselves between this randomness and order where they can somehow use both in order to configure and reconfigure themselves, going through both integration and differentiation in evolving to become more complex. 
 
Mitchell Waldrop provides a description of the edge of chaos concept in his book: "The balance point -- often called the edge of chaos -- is where the components of a system never quite lock into place, and yet never quite dissolve into turbulence either... The edge of chaos is where life has enough stability to sustain itself and enough creativity to deserve the name of life. The edge of chaos is where new idea and innovative genotypes are forever nibbling away at the edges of the status quo, and where even the most entrenched old guard will eventually be overthrown. The edge of chaos is where centuries of slavery and segregation suddenly give way to the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s; where seventy years of Soviet communism suddenly give way to political turmoil and ferment; where eons of evolutionary stability suddenly give way to wholesale species transformation. The edge is the constantly shifting battle zone between stagnation and anarchy, the one place where a complex system can be spontaneous, adaptive and alive.” 
 
Systems that evolve along the edge of chaos periodically re-integrate into structures with temporary stability, which bear recognizable resemblance to the string of predecessor structures. They are free enough to change, but stable enough to stay recognizable. In describing the edge of chaos, complexity scientists have documented and analyzed qualities that humans have sought in our social systems for some time. A vibrant democracy is an “edge of chaos” form of governance; a healthy market is an “edge of chaos” form of economics; a flexible and adaptive organization is an “edge of chaos” institution; and a mature, well-developed personality is an “edge of chaos” psyche. 
 
**Social Dynamics** 
 
The question of macro-scale social dynamics is of great interest to many. Questions of why the Easter Islanders or Mayan civilization collapsed, capture our imagination and challenge us to question whether there is some fundamental dynamic built into social systems through which we can interpret these events. We see clear recurring patterns of instability that lead to financial crisis and the fall of brittle dictatorships, but we also see social systems in places like Indonesia and Japan, that have managed to develop over hundreds or even thousands of years in a stable fashion. And of course this is not just an academic debate but of great relevance to our world as the 21st-century context is challenging us to tackle this big idea of how to develop sustainable economies and societies. 
 
**Social Dynamics** 
 
Complexity theory has a number of different models to help us in trying to formalize the dynamics to social systems, and this area of research is called social dynamics. Social dynamics uses various mathematical and computational models, but probably the most important and the one we will be focusing on here is that of system dynamics. 
 
The system dynamics modeling paradigm is used for analyzing complex systems in many different areas. It is part of systems theory, as such, it takes a holistic perspective on a system's development over time trying to capture the basic causal interactions that drive its long-term pattern of development. System dynamics is another nonlinear modeling framework as it is very much focused on these feedback loops that we have been previously discussing. If we remember, there are just two types of feedback loops: positive and negative. So we will talk about how each of these affects social systems' development over time. 
 
**Linear** 
 
As we have previously touched upon, negative feedback involves some balancing mechanism, meaning what happens now will get balanced out by something that happens in the future. Thus, there is some counteracting force that will hold the system within some limiting parameter values. For example, if I take out a loan, I will now have lots of money, but this is being counterbalanced by what I will have to pay back in the future. This counter balancing creates a steady flow within the system. Whatever is being gained is being lost again at some future stage. Thus, we do not get a build up of large accumulations within the system. Negative feedback is an inherent control mechanism, a system governed by this negative feedback can be said to be under control. 
 
**Non-equilibrium** 
 
We get positive feedback when the system starts to move in one direction without a counterbalancing force being exerted. Through this positive feedback, we get nonlinear exponential change, and the system is now out of control. Nonlinear change and non-equilibrium are a product of some broken negative feedback. This means the system is not paying the full price for its operation. There is some free source of energy being imported to the system and/or entropy is being exported to the system's environment. As an example, we might think about the huge change within human society as we moved into the modern era. Human society, demographics and economic output remained relatively stable for thousands of years due to the fact that it was fueled by manual labor that represents a negative feedback loop. In order to produce physical resources you had to do physical work, thus you are taking from your own stock of resources. In order to get more, you had to give more, thus balancing each other and maintaining some equilibrium. With the rise of modern technologies and the use of petroleum, we have broken this negative feedback loop. We now no longer have to do all of this manual labor, and this has lead, among other factors, to exponential growth driven by this positive feedback loop. But of course, as we know, these fossil fuels and modern systems of technology are creating negative externalities. 
 
**Negative externalities** 
 
This positive feedback happens because of some externality. The cost is being borne by someone or something else, meaning that the counterbalancing force is being in some way externalized from the system. We could take the recent financial crisis due to subprime mortgages as an example. Within any financial security, there is both a risk and a return, which creates the negative feedback loop. The more return you want, the more risk you are going to have to take and this is a balancing mechanism. 
 
But with these toxic assets, the risk was being externalized, those who were making a return by supplying the assets were not bearing the actual risk. The risk was being externalized to some third party. They were paying the cost of running the system by bearing that risk. This externality created a strong incentive for those supplying the assets to overproduce, and this is the foundations of where we get the rapid growth from. 
 
As another example, we could cite the Matthew effect that we previously discussed, where the rich get richer. There is clearly a positive feedback loop here. The more you have, the more you will get - the more popular a book, video or piece of music is, the more people will want it and experiments have shown that this is simply due to its popularity, not because of any inherent quality to that item. There is, of course, a negative externality here. This excess attention that is given to these items is being taken from others. New books, videos or music will find it more difficult to gain traction and thus the overall level of meritocracy in the system will be reduced as well as the overall quality. 
 
Another example of this would be the phenomenon of groupthink. The more people that believe in an idea or opinion, the more of an attraction this places on others to also believe in it. Out of this, we can then get the emperor's new clothes phenomena, where people are simply believing in something because everyone else is also. Again, this is a form of negative externality. Because no one is questioning the actual value of that thing, this can distort any form of value system that correlates with the underlying context that is supporting it. And of course the classical example of this being bubbles. within financial markets, where people start to believe something has value just because it has value within the financial system irrespective of its value within the real economy. And of course, this is distorting the real economy which the whole system is ultimately dependent upon. 
 
This positive feedback and negative externality mechanism is a pervasive phenomenon within sociocultural systems. As an example, within psychology, we might think about the phenomenon of confirmation bias, which is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's beliefs or hypotheses, while giving disproportionately less consideration to alternative possibilities. There is a positive feedback loop as these hypotheses are self-fulfilling and there is a negative externality in that they are excluding other alternatives. 
 
**Path Dependency** 
 
In all of these examples, this positive feedback dynamic, coupled with negative externalities, ultimately works to disintegrate the environment or context within which the system operates. Thus reducing its sustainability. These positive feedback loops combined with negative externalities are a key source of path dependency, as positive feedback creates a strong attractor towards a certain behavior, while negative externalities work to degrade other possibilities and options, creating a lock-in effect, making it more and more difficult to choose some other path. 
 
Positive feedback makes it easier to do more of the same, while negative externalities reduce the development of other options. What this means is inertia, which is the resistance to change. That we stay doing the same thing and become more incapable of doing other things. Think about learning a new language. It is not so difficult for a child to learn a second language as they are growing up, but the further you go down the path of speaking just one language the better you get at it, and the more difficult it becomes to learn another - this is path dependency. As the system develops, it gets more efficient at exploiting or processing a particular resource, but also more dependent upon this single resource, creating a lock-in effect. 
 
So called carbon lock-in is an example of this. Carbon lock-In refers to the self-perpetuating inertia created by large fossil fuel-based energy systems that inhibit public and private efforts to introduce alternative energy technologies. The source of carbon lock-in inertia arises from the co-evolution of large interdependent technological networks and the social institutions and cultural practices that support and benefit from the system's development. The growth of the system is fostered by increasing returns to scale, which is a positive feedback. But this example will help to illustrate an important part of this dynamic surrounding complexity. As the system stays developing down a particular trajectory, this development means increased complexity, more subsystems with greater interconnectivity and interdependency between them. This complexity has to be maintained and it costs something to do that. 
 
**Cost of Complexity** 
 
The American anthropologist and historian Joseph Tainter has studied many forms of social collapse, and he talks about this phenomenon of increased complexity as such: "When I looked at what happened to ancient societies over long periods of time I realized the challenge they faced was the cost of their societies becoming more and more complex. As these societies faced problems, whether it was problems of external enemies or managing their own environment, they would tend to develop more complex institutions. Very often, this meant a larger military, a larger government or more control over their people. Thus, these societies tended to tax their citizens more heavily to pay for their complex problem solving. The difficulty with complexity is that it always costs. In ancient societies that I have studied, for example the Roman Empire, a great problem that they faced was when they would have to incur very high costs just to maintain the status quo. Invest very high amounts that don’t yield a net positive return but instead simply allowed them to maintain what they had already got." 
 
**Percolation** 
 
In all of these previous examples, the positive feedback loop is insulating and protecting the system from disturbances from its environment. Groupthink reduces the social system's exposure to external ideas that might disturb the consensus. Confirmation bias reduces the exposure of our hypothesis to disconfirmation. Our store of petroleum enables us to create artificial environments independent from the natural environment. When we reduce the disturbance during the system's development, we increase the tightening of the coupling within the system, connections become stronger and as it develops they become denser. A system that is moving towards a critical point, has a high degree of connectivity and interdependence between its subunits. This is called high percolation, where we can think of percolation as simply the density of the connections within the system. 
 
A good example of this is research done on forest fires in California, which has shown that, if the forest receives fewer disturbances - if we reduce the number of small frequent fires - then the density of trees within the ecosystem builds up. It becomes more tightly coupled, as the percolation increases. This creates more pathways for the fire to spread from tree to tree. As this percolation becomes denser, the system reaches a point from where any small fire can now spread through the whole forest, creating a large systemic effect and this is what we call criticality, the system has reached a critical point. 
 
**Criticality** 
 
When we have all these factors: positive feedback driving the system down a particular trajectory; negative externalities degrading alternative options; the growing cost of maintaining the system's complexity; tight coupling, interdependencies, and high percolation. Then the system is moving into a critical regime. The term critical in mathematics and physics relates to or denotes a point of transition from one state to another, these critical points before a transition are studied within the domain of nonlinear dynamics called catastrophe theory. Catastrophe theory studies dramatic changes within the system's topology, the most famous of which being what is called the cusp curve where the topology dramatically folds back on itself, creating a cliff like structure. 
 
A system is then said to be critical if its state changes dramatically given some small change in an input value to a control parameter. Once the system reaches its critical point, even the smallest perturbation can have major consequences. And this is uncontrollable. As the system becomes more critical, its eventual collapse becomes greater and its eventual transformation becomes more inevitable, but less predictable. We know it is going to happen because any small event can trigger it at this stage, but because it is in this critical state and so many small events can trigger this transformation, we don't know which one will or when they will. 
 
Beyond the critical point, we get some runaway effect, a tipping point has been passed and the system moves into a phase transition as it is now irreversibly moving into a new state. At this stage, the system becomes extremely nonlinear, cause and effect break down almost completely. Massive direct interventions within the system can have very negligible effect. You as a government can put billions into the market buying up toxic assets and only have a negligible effect on the price. Because the failure is distributed, out any small event can trigger a large systemic effect. In this situation, there is no real possibility for control. Previously unknown interconnections and interdependencies become revealed and random events can determine significant outcomes. This is what is called societal collapse. The system is moving to a lower state of functionality as the social structure breaks down. 
 
This process of non-equilibrium social dynamics is equally applicable to micro and macro social systems. From a financial trader going boom and bust through the positive feedback loop of irrational exuberance to small extremist groups formed out of the positive feedback and negative externalities of some ideology built on out-group derogation. And of course, it is applicable to whole societies as described by conflict theory where the positive feedback of the rich getting rich effect leads to increased inequality, which, if left without a counterbalance, will move the social system towards extreme polarization. At some point, the oppressed simply can't bear the oppression anymore and we get ensuing riots and revolution. And of course, we also see this pattern of societal collapse on the macro level of whole civilizations such as with the Roman Empire. 
 
**Self-Organizing Criticality** 
 
This whole social dynamic of positive feedback driving exponential growth and decay is a form of what is called self-organized criticality, which is a property of nonlinear dynamical systems that have a critical point as an attractor. Another good example of this would be the tragedy of the commons, where each individual is driven through a positive feedback loop to overuse the commons with the negative externalities from this destroying the whole resource and leading to the collapse. This is self-organizing criticality because it is the way the dynamic is set up that attracts the agents towards pursuing agendas that lead to a macro level critical outcome. 
 
**Summary** 
 
In this chapter, we have been looking at social systems dynamics. We talked about how positive and negative feedback can give us one model for interpreting these dynamics. We briefly discussed how negative feedback can give us a relatively stable process of development involving counterbalancing forces that maintain the system within some equilibrium. We then went on to talk about a non-equilibrium process of change where this negative feedback loop gets broken and positive feedback, coupled with negative externalities, leads to rapid unsustainable development. 
 
Within this dynamic, path dependence, lock-in and heightened percolation all lead to eventual criticality and a phase transition. 
 
We have been using these very simple tools of feedback loops to describe what are in reality very complex processes of change. Feedback loops do offer us some deep insight into this dynamic, but if we wanted to get a more sophisticated and complete representation, we would need to add a few more tools to our toolbox. That includes the ideas of adaptation, diversity and the process of evolution - all of which would help us to understand better how social systems manage to develop more sustainably. We will be covering evolution and adaptation in the last part of the book so we will move on for the moment. 
 
**Self Organized Criticality** 
 
In the previous chapter, we briefly introduce the idea of self-organized criticality, and here we will dig a bit deeper into this topic. Self-organized criticality (SOC) is a property of nonlinear dynamical systems that have a critical point as an attractor. As mentioned, the tragedy of the commons is a form of self-organized criticality. Out of local events, that is to say by everyone acting in their own rational self-interest, using the commons as much as possible, this will drive the whole system to a critical state where we get the overuse of the commons and global collapse. The point being that this collapse was the attractor to that system. Thus we can say that it is the way that the local rules are setup that creates the destructive global outcome. 
 
This phenomenon of self-organized criticality has been identified in many different systems from earthquakes to fluctuations within financial markets, to ecological evolution to outbreaks of epidemics and the occurrence of solar flares. Self-organized criticality is typically illustrated with reference to what is called the sandpile model, developed by researcher Pear Bac. The sandpile model was the first model to exhibit self-organized critical behavior, where the system endogenously moves towards its critical (phase transition) point. 
 
The model is taken from the empirical observation that when we drop small grains (of something like sand) on top of each other, they will build up into a pile with occasional grains running off - one or two at a time, in proportion to the rate at which we are dropping them. This is the linear equilibrium state to the system's development. Grains of sand are held on the pile by its low incline and the friction from other grains that have already built up (this is the attractor). 
 
But at some critical point, the pile of sand has built up to such an extent that the incline on the side has reached a critical level. By dropping just one additional grain of sand we can cause a cascading avalanche, a positive feedback as each new grain of sand that cascades down destabilizes the system more which will feedback to effect more grains to slide off. 
 
The sandpile phenomena is a classical example of nonlinear change. Here again, we can note the prolonged period for which the system was held within a stable equilibrium and the very short period of rapid nonlinear change. This is an illustration of punctuated equilibrium, prolonged periods of stability and then rapid phase transitions characteristic of nonlinear change and as we previously noted we cannot predict when these nonlinear change events will happen. 
 
**Social Network Science** 
 
Social network analysis is now one of the major paradigms in contemporary sociology and is also employed in many other social sciences. It offers us a powerful formal language with which to model and analyze the structure of social relations and how this structure defines the overall social system. The big idea here is that of connectivity. A central axiom of the social network approach to understanding social interaction is that social phenomena should be primarily investigated through the properties of relations between and within units, instead of the properties of these units themselves. 
 
As such, social network analysis is an alternative way of investigating complex social systems, one that is not focused on the actors and their properties but instead on how they are interconnected. And this is a paradigm shift, a very different way of seeing the world. In our traditional paradigm, we see things, we don't really see the connections because connections are much more abstract - we can typically touch and hold things but not connections. Connections are also typically much more complex. For every one thing, we can have possibly an infinite amount of connections. Networks very quickly take us into the world of complexity. 
 
In order to understand this way of seeing the world, we need to firstly appreciate that connectivity creates a new kind of space. We are used to a linear conception of space, what is called a Euclidean space. It is the world we walk around in every day and see all these people and things that have certain properties to them. But now imagine you pull out your mobile phone, and it is almost as easy to call a person just next door as it is to call someone on the other side of the planet. This is a new kind of space, where our traditional linear conception of space is being stretched and distorted by this connectivity. 
 
Connectivity creates a nonlinear type of space, and that space is better called a topology. Topology is a branch of mathematics that can be used to abstract the inherent connectivity of objects while ignoring their detailed form. In its most general definition, topology means the way in which constituent parts are interrelated or arranged. Thus for any set of things or people, we can have a different set of global rules for how they are interrelated. 
 
**Flow** 
 
So why should we care about any of this? Because as we noted networks are all about connectivity and connectivity is an exchange along which something will flow. Along with every connection, there is a flow of something. In a communications networks, information flows. In a financial network, assets flow. In a political network, power flows. If there is no flow, there is no network. So now we have these two abstract concepts: we have a space, called our topology and we have connectivity which is something flowing through that topology. So to understand any given network we are going to have to understand how something flows through that particular topology. 
 
**Social Actors** 
 
The topology is the environment and the flow is the connections within that environment. As we are analyzing social systems here, this environment may be a physical one where we are talking about basic demographics, the movement of people, migration, the spreading of viruses, urban transportation etc. All of these are social connections that take place within a physical environment. But also we can have an economic environment, giving us networks of financial and economic connections. We can have a political environment through which power flows, a cultural environment through which beliefs, values, and ideologies flow. All of these are very different topologies, with different forces acting on them. In order to understand these networks we need to understand these forces that are acting within that environment. 
 
**Micro Macro** 
 
There are really two different ways to start analyzing a network. By either taking a micro level bottom up perspective, where we are talking about the agents, why and how they make connections or a more global perspective, where we are looking at the overall network and the environmental context to see how this shapes the system of connections. Within any social network, we have some agent that is choosing to make that connection. Agents typically make connections based upon some return on their investment of time energy, interest, social capital or some other resource that they value. We make friends with people whose company we like, we believe in ideologies that we value, we watch television channels that we find interesting. These are all connections that we make because we value what we get more than what we have to give in making the connection. 
 
**Environment** 
 
But there is also the context or environment within which an agent is acting. That environment is exerting some force resisting or enabling them to make that connection. 
As an example we might think about an oppressive political regime that uses intimidation, coercion, and propaganda to prevent people from forming counter political movements. This is a form of resistance - the agents have to overcome their fear in order to make political connections within this environment. 
So we can understand this environmental context as a form of transaction cost, a cost that is being placed on an agent for them to make a connection. Inversely, it might be a payment where the environment is conducive to them making that connection. We might think about an ecosystem as an analogy, where when we turn down the temperature all the creatures hibernate and when we turn it up they come out and interact. But the cost of making a connection is not evenly distributed out. Some options will be easier, some more difficult. It is like water running through some rocks where it finds the course of least resistance. 
 
So these are very general considerations, but they will help us in contextualizing and understanding the nature of the whole network and the kind of forces that it is under. Social network science is quite an analytical approach and networks are quite abstract representations. This makes them powerful tools, but it is also important not to lose sight of the fact that these networks exist within some context and to understand the general nature of that context. Or else we can get blinded by our tools. 
 
**Integration** 
 
Because networks are all about connectivity and processes taking place through those connections, a central and overarching question will be that of network integration. 
One of the most important factors with respect to the nature of any society is the question of social cohesion or structural cohesion, where we are asking about the degree of integration to the overall system, as this correlates to such things as social solidarity, shared norms, identity, collective behavior, etc. The idea of social capital is often used as a metric to a society's degree of cohesion. Social capital may be defined as the network of relationships among people who live and work in a particular society, enabling that society to function effectively. 
 
So from this perspective, when we ask what is the difference between a socially functional urban community and a socially dysfunctional ghetto, we would say that there is some integration within the first that enables the flow of economic resources and social capital, while we could say the second represents a disintegrated network that inhibits the flow of these resources, disconnecting it from the broader social system and rendering it dysfunctional. Put very simply, a central interest here in how something flows through the whole social network as it is this flow that gives it cohesion. This is obviously a very big and fundamental question when analyzing any social system. How integrated the whole system is, will be determined by many different factors. 
 
**Density** 
 
A primary consideration is the density of connections within the whole system. Clearly, the more connections, the more integrated it will be, and going from a system with a low level of connectivity to one with a high level represents a very different overall dynamic. At a low level of overall connectivity, we are just dealing with a group of people. At a high level, we actually have a networked system. This fundamentally changes the dynamic and we will be discussing it in a future chapter. 
 
**Clustering** 
 
A second key consideration affecting the overall integration to a social network is the degree of clustering. Clustering is one of the few universal features found in almost all social networks, from the social networks of ancient hunter-gather tribes of Africa to today's global networks. Clustering is derived from the fact that people form connections to people with similar attributes to themselves, what is called homophily. Out of this, we get global patterns consisting of local communities that have their own distinct structure. These clusters give social networks a distinct heterogeneity to their topology that makes them resistant to the uniform spreading of some phenomena. 
 
**Path Length** 
 
Another widely encountered phenomena within social networks is that of short average path length, meaning that although a social network may be quite large in terms of its number of members, and despite the fact that they may contain significant clustering, we often find that any member is connected to any other by just a few links. This is where we get the famous six degrees of separation hypothesis from. This average path length is again a key metric with respect to the overall integration of the social network. We are all aware of how social solidarity can break down as we scale the community up. The traditional mechanisms for social solidarity that worked for thousands of years as we lived in small rural communities break down in large urban centers, and this is still one of the great challenges that the modern era has presented. This metric of average path length is very important to social cohesion, as it is a primary factor in determining how close everyone will think they are to each other and the degree of interdependence and cohesion. 
 
**Degree distribution** 
 
Finally, the last almost universal feature of social networks is a very high degree of inequality between how connected people are within the network. Here, we are talking about degree distribution. A high degree distribution means some people have lots of links while others very few. And we often see that this inequality is quite extreme. In fact, it follows a power law, meaning that there will be some who have a very high level of connections, such as a celebrity. Again, there is a positive feedback loop driving. 
 
But this degree distribution is another important determinant of the level of social integration. A low degree distribution gives us a somewhat egalitarian society, with the topology having a certain evenness to it through which the same phenomena can flow to all. This is in contrast to the many sociocultural systems we see that are in fact highly centralized with significant degrees of inequality in connectivity, that creates some resistance to a uniform spreading. 
 
**Summary** 
 
In this chapter, we have been taking a very high-level view to social network analysis. We have talked about how connectivity creates a certain type of space, or what we called a topology that stretches and distorts our traditional conception of linear space. We discussed how reasoning about the general forces that are acting on the network can help us in providing some overall context to our analysis, where we need to consider both the rules under which the agents are making connections and the environmental constraints that affect those choices, either enabling or constraining them. We then went on to talk about some of the primary considerations to a social network's overall makeup and social cohesion, touching upon the topics of network density as the primary factor; clustering that creates local communities with a heterogeneous topology; we cited average path length as another key factor to the network's overall cohesion; and lastly mentioned degree distribution as a metric for the degree of equality within the system. 
 
**Network Communities** 
 
In this chapter, we will be talking about social networks on the micro level, looking at agents and their local communities. We will quickly talk about the basics of social graphs, before going on to discuss a number of different metrics for trying to understand how significant an agent is within a network. Finally, we will discuss interpersonal ties as we talk about strong and weak connections. 
 
**Nodes & Edges** 
 
The basic constituents of a social graph are nodes and edges, nodes are people or groups of people. Edges also called ties, represent the relationships between these social actors, which can come in many different kinds, such as friendship, kinship, colleague etc. These edges may be weighted meaning that we can ascribe some quantitative value to them, such as the amount of time one person spends talking to another. We can also ascribe positive and negative values to this weight. To depict positive and negative relations, such as trust or lack of trust, loans, and debts, etc. These edges can also be directed, giving us an idea to which direction the resource being exchanged is flowing, with this net flow being depicted by an arrow. Here, we can have undirected relations that go only in one direction, such as the influence that a celebrity might have over others without this influence being reciprocated. Or it may be a bidirectional relation like a typical friendship with each influencing each other. 
 
**Centrality & Influence** 
 
A primary question we are often interested in when looking at the individual agents within a network is not to do with their properties in isolation, but instead asking how influential are they within that network based upon their connections. This measurement of how influential or powerful an agent is within a given network is called centrality. Almost all sociologists would agree that power and influence are fundamental properties of social structures. Network thinking has contributed a number of important insights about social power and influence. Perhaps most importantly, the network approach emphasizes that power is inherently relational. An individual does not have power in the abstract. They have power because they can dominate others -- an ego's power is an alter's dependence and this metric of centrality is a primary tool for helping us in modeling how the social structure of relations give agents influence and power. Social network analysis has made important contributions in providing precise definitions and concrete measures to this idea of power and influence based upon an agent's position within a social structure of relations. 
 
Because a network can be considered a description of the paths along which something flows, the significance of any agent to that network can be understood in terms of how much of the network's resources flow through that node, and how critical is it to that flow. Both of these factors will give them the capacity to influence whatever resource is flowing and it is from this that they get their influence within the network. Whereas influence and power are well defined within a hierarchical social structure, networks are not so orderly. Influence is often context dependent, and of course, we should remember that being central within a network is not always a good thing. It works both ways. Centrality measures are really just telling us how embedded an agent is within that social network. 
 
Network analysis often describes the way that an actor is embedded in a relational network as both imposing constraints on the actor, and offering the actor opportunities. Actors that face fewer constraints, and have more opportunities than others are said to be in more favorable structural position. Having a favored position means that an actor may extract better bargains in exchanges, have greater influence and that the actor will be a focus for deference and attention from those in less favored positions. But, what do we mean by "having a favored position" and having "more opportunities" or "fewer constraints?" There are no single correct and final answers to these difficult questions. Trying to capture how influential an agent is within a network is not trivial, it is quite complex in reality. Thus, researchers use a number of different metrics, including, degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and prestige centrality. 
 
**Degree Centrality** 
 
Actors who have more ties to other actors may be in an advantaged position. Because they have many ties, they may have alternative ways to satisfy needs, and hence are less dependent on other individuals. Because they have many ties, they may have access to, and be able to call on more of the resources of the network as a whole. Because they have many ties, they are often third-parties and deal makers in exchanges among others, and are able to benefit from this brokerage. 
 
And thus the primary measure to the significance of any social actor within a network is his or her degree of connectivity, which is simply how many connections they have and the weight of those connections if relevant. This tells us the likelihood of a node contacting or being able to effect in some way whatever is being exchanged within their immediate network. It tells us something about their embeddedness within that network. Thus, a higher degree of connectivity may be a positive or negative thing depending on what is spreading within the network. A node with a high degree of connectivity is termed a hub. But this simple degree of connectivity measurement is a very blunt way of interpreting a node's significance that can often be misleading. We will need a number of other metrics to support it. 
 
**Closeness Centrality** 
 
Closeness centrality is another metric for interpreting a node's significance, one that looks at how far it is to any other node in the network. As distance is assumed to be a restriction on transmission, whichever agent is closest to all others can have the greatest capacity to affect them. 
 
**Betweenness centrality** 
 
Betweenness centrality is a third metric quantifying how often a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between any other nodes in the network. This gives the agent influence in that it is playing a role to reduce the distance between any two nodes, thus significantly helping to hold the network together by reducing transaction costs. Institutions that work as market makers within the financial system are a good example of this. They are working as critical bridges between agents and organizations, holding the network together and thus they can demand significant transaction fees. 
 
This is also called occupying a structural whole, meaning that the agent who is working as a link between two clusters is filling some gap within the network that is critical in maintaining its overall integration. This actor is bridging two communities and may play a critical role in transferring information or some other valued resource. For example, they may be transferring information between two scientific domains or playing a critical role as mediator during periods of conflict between two clustered communities. 
 
**Prestige Centrality** 
 
Lastly, prestige centrality, which is really looking at how connected the nodes that you are connected to are. These prestige metrics such as eigenvector centrality, assign relative scores to all nodes in the network based on the concept that connections to high-scoring nodes contribute more to the score of the node in question than equal connections to low-scoring nodes. So your centrality and influence is greater if the people you are connected to are well connected. The assumption is that each node's centrality is the sum of the centrality values of the nodes that it is connected to. 
 
**Interpersonal Ties** 
 
Next, we will talk about the local connections that agents make, what are called interpersonal ties. As we previously discussed, making connections typically costs something in terms of resources. Laying cables to transport information costs money, making new friends or developing a diplomatic relation with another country takes time and some effort. Added to this, we can recognize that making connections between different components typically requires more resources than making those same connections between similar component, whether we are talking about connections between computers with different operating systems, trade between countries with different import procedures or communications between different cultures. The fact that it requires less resource to make connections between components with similar attributes is a key factor in the make-up of many networks and particularly so with social networks. 
 
It in many ways defines the difference between strong and weak ties that describe the intensity of interpersonal ties between actors. A strong tie is between two agents that interact frequently and typically share similar attributes. Thus, they are connections that are typically easier for us to enact. Inversely, a weak tie connects people to different social circles, they can be more challenging in that they require the agent to overcome some difference between groups, but they also expose the person to novel phenomena and information. The "strength" of an interpersonal tie is a product of many different factors. It may be a combination of the amount of time, the emotional intensity, the intimacy, or some other reciprocal service that, in that relation, the greater the exchange, the stronger the tie. 
 
**Clustering** 
 
Most of the time, most people interact through strong ties with a fairly small subset of others, many of whom know one another and this creates a distinct substructure within the network, what we call a cluster. This clustering pattern is an almost universal feature of social networks. Social clustering can be understood by simply asking how many of the people that someone is connected to are also connected to each other. Evidence suggests that in most real-world networks, and in particular social networks, nodes tend to create tightly knit groups characterized by a relatively high density of ties and clustering. These closely knit clustered communities can maintain their diversity in the face of homogeneity within the larger network. 
 
The extent to which these subpopulations are open or closed may be a telling dimension of social structure. With too many strong ties, we can get strong clustering and a network that tends to be fragmented into local communities. These clumpy networks will have longer distances relative to other networks with the same density and these clusters slow the even flow across the network. 
 
**Weak Ties** 
 
Weak ties, in contrast to strong ties, connect people to different social circles. As such, they are bridging ties that expose people to new information and novel phenomena. Specifically, more novel information flows to individuals through weak rather than strong ties. Because our close friends tend to move in the same circles that we do, the information they receive overlaps considerably with what we already know. Acquaintances, by contrast, know people that we do not, and thus receive more novel information. 
 
**Small World** 
 
When we combine both strong links within clusters and these weak bridging links we get an effective network for spreading information even though it may have high clustering. This type of social graph that has both high clustering and some random bridging links, giving it a low average path length is called a small world network. These characteristics result in networks with the unique property of regional specialization and efficient long range information transfer. Social networks are intuitive examples of this small world phenomenon, in which cliques or clusters of friends are strongly interconnected, but also people often have some random acquaintances within other far of groups. By using these weak ties, we find that even within very large social networks consisting of many millions or even billions of people, any person may be only five or six links away from anyone else within the system, giving us the famous six degrees of separation theory. 
 
The "small world" phenomenon seems to have evolved independently in many large networks. Thus, we can see how these micro-level interactions of agents choosing to make strong or weak ties can give rise to overall macro-level properties to the network such as its average path length which we can see is important to its overall cohesion. 
 
**Multiplex Graph** 
 
Simple graphs allow for just one type of connection between nodes, but we can also have multiplex graphs that allow us to model a number of different relations between nodes. So, in a multiplex graph, we would draw two different edges between people to describe how they are, say, work colleagues as well as friends. Of course, this adds a significant amount of complexity to our model, but it gives us a much more realistic representation as social actors are often embedded within a multiplicity of different networks. Social, political, cultural, economic and so on. With a multiplex network, we can try and capture how these different connections interact and affect each other. This is a much more realistic picture that lies behind many social phenomena and a lot more faithful to one of the basic premise of complexity theory. That is that many phenomena are in fact the product of a multiplicity of nonlinear interacting forces. As a quick example, we might think about the recent uprisings in Egypt. When we first look at this phenomenon, we would consider it political in nature and start analyzing the political network. But research has shown a robust correlation between spikes in the price of basic foods and the occurrence of these riots. Thus, these events are an emergent phenomenon of different interacting networks. Social, political and economic all putting stress on the social system. In this situation, it would be of use to use a multiplex network to try and model the overall dynamic. Phenomena like this are very complex, they are embedded within many different overlapping networks. Simply modeling one of these networks can only ever give us a partial insight. This is the nature of complex systems of all kind, they are multi-dimensional. 
 
**Summary** 
 
In this chapter, we have been looking at social networks on the micro level, talking about local communities. We started off by laying down the basics of graph theory and talking about centrality measures that can help us in modeling how influential or powerful an agent is within a network. Based upon their connections, we talked about four different metrics, citing degree of connectivity as a primary consideration, but also closeness centrality and betweenness centrality. 
 
We then went on to talk about interpersonal ties that are divided into strong and weak. Strong ties being typically between people with similar attributes that interact more frequently and intensely. While weak ties are random in nature working to bridge between communities playing an important role in transferring information. We talked about clustering and how a combination of both strong clustering and some random weak ties can give us the small world phenomena with a surprisingly low average path length - even within very large networks. Finally, we touched upon the topic of multiplex networks in order to get a more complete representation of complex social systems as the interaction of a number of different relational types. 
 
**Network Structure** 
 
In the previous chapter, we looked at social networks on the micro level, talking about individuals and local clusters. In this chapter, we will be adopting a more "macro" perspective that focuses on the overall network structure within which individual actors are embedded. The "top down" perspective we'll follow here seeks to understand and describe whole populations by the makeup of the overall network. Primary among our considerations here will be the network's overall density of connections, its average path length, and degree distribution. 
 
**Network Density** 
 
Overall network density is a primary determinant in the make-up of any network, with density we are simply asking how many connections are there relative to the maximum possible number of connections. Network density can be understood in terms of interaction cost. The easier it is for agents to make connections, the more connections we are likely to have. Network density is a very fundamental parameter in that it defines the difference between a social system that is a network as opposed to being simply a group of people. At a low level of connectivity, we are dealing mainly with individuals in isolation, here it is the attributes and properties of those individuals in isolation that matters. 
 
When we turn up the connectivity, this is no longer so much the case. It is now the nature of the network that you are a part of that matters. This is captured in the famous saying "it is not what you know but who you know". 
 
If we are dealing with a social system with a low level of overall connectivity, then it does matter what you as an individual know. But at a higher density of connections, it is more what your network knows that matters. We see this with the internet. We ourselves used to have most of the information and knowledge that we would use on a daily basis but now much more of the information we use, we do not have ourselves but is instead in the network. 
 
Thus, as we turn up the degree of connectivity within the social system, it is no longer the attributes of the agents in isolation that is so important. But instead, their capacity to interoperate, provide something of value to the network and ensure their connectivity to that network. 
 
As another example, we might think about the difference between so-called introverted and extroverted people. Introverted people with a low level of social connectivity have to rely heavily on their own capabilities and they are often more self-resourceful, whereas extroverts who can rely heavily on their network may not have such personal capabilities but are instead particularly good at accessing the skills and resources they lack through their social network. 
 
Thus, the overall connectivity is a primary (Continued from page 110)

determinant within any social system and also one of the determinants to the nature of power within the organization, as within a social system that has a very low density and loose coupling, not much power can be exerted. In high-density social systems, there are more and stronger channels through which power can be exerted. 

**Path Length** 

Network density is also a key determinant to average path length. Here we are talking about how close any two agents within the network are to each other on average. This closeness is obviously a very important factor in terms of cohesion and interdependence. As we scale up the number of components to the social system, this creates longer path lengths between members. This can stretch and break traditional forms of social cohesion. A longer average path length is like an outward force disintegrating the social system as it puts people at a longer distance from each other with a lower sense of interdependency. 

We can also note that the longer the path length the easier it is for sub groups to form and disintegrate the overall social network. Agents act and adapt to their local environment. If we turn up the average path length between agents or groups, they will not identify with, or adapt to those other members, and we may get the formation of incompatible local clusters. In trying to achieve global coordination within such a system, we would likely mean having to impose it in some top-down fashion. 

But now, if we turn down the average path length, which could happen through better transportation or communications technology, people now interact more often making it easier for them to synchronize their states and easier for them to recognize their interdependence and common identity. 

**Degree Distribution** 

Probably the second most important question we can ask about the overal structure to a social network relates to its degree distribution. Degree distribution is a measurement of how evenly or unevenly the degree of connectivity is distributed out among the agents. Degree distribution is important because it is really telling us how equal or unequal resources are distributed out in the system. It is asking the question do some people have a lot of connections and others have very few? Or does everyone have roughly the same degree? This is clearly going to tell us a lot about the nature of power within that system. High degree distribution will mean inequality of some kind that will be detrimental to social integration, and it is in many ways this inequality in connectivity that is the means through which power can be exerted. 

This degree distribution tells us a lot about how centralized or distributed the network structure is. At a low degree distribution, all actors have relatively the same amount of connections. Thus, they would be what we consider peers and we would get many peer-to-peer interactions giving us a distributed network. As an example of a distributed social system, we might think of the Israeli Kibbutzim, which are collective communities in Israel that were traditionally based on agriculture. 

Within the Kibbutzim, the principle of equality was taken very seriously up until recently. Members did not individually own tools or even clothing. They ate meals together in the communal dining hall, and major decisions about the future of the community were made by consensus or by vote amongst all. Distributed social systems like this have limited centralized institutions. Everyone is responsible for maintaining the system and power is thus distributed out. Although distributed social networks may exist, they are often the product of some random process, or a small informal network, or a network in its early formation where it has not developed any overall formal organization. Or, as in this example, of the Kibbutz the social network has been specifically designed to be egalitarian in nature. 

**Scale-Free Networks** 

But more often, what we see is that, as a social network develops and particularly when it becomes more formal, we get greater differentiation between degrees of connectivity. Many real world social networks show a skewed node-degree distribution in which most nodes have only few links but, by contrast, there exist some nodes which are extremely well connected. This heavy-tailed distribution is known as a power-law or scale-free network. Here we are getting the emergence of major hubs and high degrees of social inequality. 

There may be two different reasons for this inequality. Firstly, some people are simply better at doing certain things than others. We all watch certain people play football, sing or act simply because they are better at it than others. And what we mean by that is that they provide us with a better return on our investment of time, energy or money and thus many of us choose to make connections to that particular node, while others do not receive our attention. Thus, giving us this unequal, centralized model and this process is meritocratic in nature. This explanation is largely intuitive to us, but it might not be sufficed to explain how we can get such extreme differences in connectivity within these scale free social networks. Researchers have then also come up with another explanation behind the formation of these scale free networks, that of preferential attachment. 

**Preferential Attachment** 

As we have previously discussed, a preferential attachment process is any of a class of processes in which some quantity, typically some form of wealth or attention, is distributed among a number of individuals or objects according to how much they already have, so that those who already have lots receive more and those who already have little receive less. 

The best example of how preferential attachment works is seen in recent research done by Duncan Watts and team, where they created two websites selling music tracks. One where people could rate the songs they downloaded and one where they could not. Over 14,000 participants then downloaded previously unknown songs on both sides. On the site where users could leave feedback for each track and others could see that feedback, it was found that there was a much greater disparity between the most and least downloaded songs compared to the other site where there was no feedback available. Thus, increasing the strength of social influence increased the inequality in degree distribution. This power law distribution also applies to cities. The distribution of wealth and income and many other phenomena where we have social interaction creating feedback loops that amplify the disparity to give us a much greater degree distribution than would occur if simply generated by merit. And this creates major centralized hubs within the network, weather we are talking about an urban network, financial network or some other social network. 

**Summary** 

In this chapter, we have been talking about three of the major factors shaping the overall make-up to a social network. We started by talking about the density of connections as a primary factor, as it defines whether we are actually dealing with a network or just a group of independent people. This level of overall connectivity will fundamentally change the whole system as, when we turn it up, our focus has to shift from the properties of the parts to the flow of resources within the network. We then talked about average path length as a second key overall metric one that will tell us a lot about the network's overall cohesion. Lastly, we looked at degree distribution as playing an important role in defining the degree of equality within the system. Degree distribution tells us a lot about how centralized or distributed the network is, which is of major significance in understanding the dynamics of power and how something will flow through the whole system. 

**Network Diffusion** 

As we have previously discussed, networks are all about connectivity and what is flowing along those connections. How something spreads across a social network is then one of the central questions within social network analysis. The study of network diffusion tries to capture the underlying mechanism of how events propagate through a complex network. Whether the subject of interest is a virus spreading through some population, the spreading of some social movement, some new fashion or innovation or it may be a marketing message through an online social network. Whatever the phenomena of interest, the primary questions remain the same. That of what are the different forces that are affecting its diffusion and how will the structure of the network effect that process? How fast will it spread? For example, will we get tipping points? How can we enable or constrain that process of diffusion? And these are some of the questions we will touch upon in this chapter. 

**Forces** 

Firstly, we need to understand the forces acting on the network. What are the forces pushing the phenomena over the network? That is to say how contagious is it? And inversely we need to ask what are the counteracting forces resisting its spreading. So we are talking about the infectiousness of the phenomena on the one hand, and the resistance of the agents to that phenomena on the other. These are two counteracting forces. 

As an example, we might think about the social network of some society consisting of a dominant and minority culture. As a concrete example, we might think about the current situation in Myanmar with a minority of Muslims and majority of Buddhists within the population. Now, we will add some actors within the majority culture that are trying to promulgate some rhetoric of violence towards the minority group within this network and ask how it will spread. So we have the outward force of these actors spreading this rhetoric that has a certain degree of infectiousness, but we also have the individual's opinions that may be more or less receptive to that message. In analyzing this social system, we might then create a conceptual or cognitive map representing people's opinions towards those of an alternative ethnicity. By understanding people's opinions, we can get an understanding of how resistant they will be to that message and thus a better understanding of the two forces at play,(Continued from page 115)

an understanding of how resistant they will be to that message and thus a better understanding of the two forces at play, and this would form the basis of our model to how rapidly this message may diffuse through that network. 

**Density** 

The density of the network is important for the obvious reason that with a high level of connectivity something has more channels through which to spread. But beyond this, we also need to ask whether the agents within the system can actually spread the phenomenon themselves or not. As we turn up the overall connectivity within the system, the nature of the diffusion changes fundamentally. At a low level of connectivity, when we are dealing with an isolated group of people, we have to try and affect the whole group. We try and broadcast to everyone, as exemplified by traditional advertising and political campaigns, that put up posters and billboards in public spaces where the mass of people will get exposure to them, this is a kind of brute force method to diffusion that is necessary at low levels of connectivity. 

But when we turn up the distributed level of connectivity, this is no longer the case. Now everyone can be a means of diffusion. We no longer need to use brute force trying to affect everyone. We can now be much more strategic, simply affecting those who have the greatest capacity to affect others. And in this way, we can get much higher leverage. Influencing the network in the right place can now have a much larger nonlinear effect. And we see this with current trends within advertising. Because we are all now much more connected, agencies can focus less on broadcasting commercials to the mass of people but instead focus more on getting influential bloggers to adopt and spread their message. 

**Clustering** 

Next, we need to consider the overall topology to the system. How something will spread across it will be significantly affected by the clustering within the network. Clustering creates heterogeneity. This might be the different ethnic and linguistic clusters within the network of global society that are resistant to the spreading of a single homogeneous ideology or we might be talking about the clustered cultural groups within a single city. This clustering and heterogeneity within the network will clearly be resistant to some uniform phenomena flowing across the entire network. 

This clustering may well also create competing phenomena within the same overall network, where a new phenomenon is introduced but given different interpretations or forms by (Continued from page 116)

different socio-cultural clusters, with these different variants then competing. We might think about the spreading of some religion that gets interpreted in different forms by different cultural groups, or the local idiolects of some common language. These are all sub-clusterings that give the network a heterogeneous topology and make it resistant to a uniform spreading. This heterogeneity due to clustering can create bottlenecks to the process of diffusion, where we have some cluster and just a few links connecting it to other groups, these links are then critical to the spreading process which reduces robustness, and increases the capacity for exercising power. 

**Centralized/Distributed** 

Centralized networks can be much more effective at spreading. With preferential attachment, we get major hubs, and those hubs are key enablers to the diffusion process. Because a hub is attached to many small nodes which may pass on the phenomena to them and then they will affect all the other nodes within their local network, thus in just two hops we have covered a whole subsystem. 

But we should always remember that centralized social systems will have strong power dynamics because of the high degree distribution, and this can distort the diffusion process. For example, if we think about giving aid to some African country such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, a large percentage of that money may well get siphoned off at the central hub of the network before diffusion really takes place. Or we might think about broadcast media, which again is a centralized system that can be very effective at disseminating information to a broad group of people. And we have seen how it has been used effectively as a means for creating national solidarity amongst millions of people within a country. But again we know it is often used as a means for manipulation and propaganda spreading. 

And this is the nature of centralized networks in general. They have a high concentration of power allowing them to be very coherent, effective and capable of rapid diffusion. But they can also be more dysfunctional as in these examples. Centralization is essentially a top-down method, meaning that few people are trying to affect many. This centralized mechanism always comes at an expense and has its limitations. And this ties back to our previous discussion about the agents within the network working to spread the phenomena. That can only happen with distributed connectivity - the agents have to be connected to each other in a peer-to-peer fashion, but centralized systems will typically repress and work to exclude these distributed connections. Thus there may be a certain trade-off here. 

**Network Effect** 

Networks don't always grow linearly but may grow exponentially. Whenever there is exponential growth there is typically some positive feedback driving it, and in this case, it is what is called the network effect. The network effect arises when users gain value from others using the same network. The more people that join, the more value for everyone else, this is a positive feedback loop. A good example of this would be a language. The value of some language is relative to the number of other users of that language, the more people that adopt that language, the more valuable it will be. People learn English, Spanish and Chinese as a second language not because those languages are in anyway better than others, but simply because billions of people speak these languages, giving them a powerful network effect and lots of value. The network effect may be seen behind the formation and spreading of many phenomena within social networks, such as the spreading of some fashion, and as always with positive feedback, it will give us exponential growth, tipping points, and cascades as we have previously talked about. 

What is happening with the network effect is that there is really a positive externality. When I chose to learn a particular language, I am not just generating value for myself, but also some of the value is being externalized to everyone else who is using that network, as they now have more communications options available to them due to this positive externality. The network effect gives us what is called Metcalfe’s law, which suggests that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of users of that network. Because of all of these positive externalities, the system as a whole now has value greater than it individuals. 

With the network effect, people will not only adopt a phenomenon based upon its value in isolation but also on the assessment of how many others will also adopt the phenomenon. We choose to go to a party or some gathering only if we think others will also go, and thus expectation becomes very important. People not only have to value something but they have to expect that others will also adopt it. And thus expectation can be a very high leverage point with respect to diffusion on social networks. The network effect is also notorious for creating lock-in because there is so much value created by everyone simply using the same network. This creates a strong force towards convergence, everyone using the one network at the expense of all others, we can see this with the dominance of English as a global language with the decline of many other smaller languages. 

**Tipping Points** 

This network effect may give the diffusion process a strong tipping point, because below a certain level of people adopting that phenomenon the value is very low - we might say sub-linear. Adopting some radical new fashion when no one else has, will come at great social cost. But doing it when everyone else has will come at a much greater value. Thus, the pioneers of some new phenomena, whether we are talking about a new political opinion, a new social movement or a new style, these first adopters will have to be very committed putting in a lot of resources and getting little out. But if the phenomenon does spread then the network effect will take hold. There will be a snowball effect due to the positive externalities. There will be some tipping point or phase transition where it rapidly goes from a fringe activity to a mainstream phenomenon and the course of least resistance. 

**Complex Contagion** 

Complex contagion is the phenomenon in social networks in which multiple sources of exposure to an innovation are required before an individual adopts the change of behavior. This differs from simple contagion in that it may not be possible for the innovation to spread after only one incident of contact with an infected neighbor. The spread of complex contagion across a network of people may depend on many social and economic factors; for instance, how many of one's friends adopt the new idea as well as how strongly they actually influence the individual. 

In complex contagion, the probability of adopting a behavior, or an idea, varies with the extent of exposure. As an example, a person might not respond when they see a piece of information on one social media site, but when they see it on another or a (Continued from page 119)

third, this may trigger them to have greater belief in that piece of information and start to share it.

When we allow for this more complex form of contagion, we now have to start to take into account different sources of contagion that may be conflicting, as we noted when talking about clustering. The spreading of propaganda may be an example of this. Within a very simple homogeneous scenario where we have just one national broadcaster, we will have a relatively simple contagion process, with just one single message being propagated. But in a more complex setting with multiple channels, there may be conflicting messages and we have to understand the network of interacting messages that people are receiving and also the significance that they ascribe to those different channels.

**Summary**

In this chapter, we have been talking about the diffusion process within social networks looking at some of the primary considerations. Talking firstly about the two counteracting forces of the infectiousness of the phenomena on the one hand and the resistance of the agents. We highlighted network density as a second factor, whereas we turn up the overall degree of distributed connectivity within the system the nature of the diffusion changes fundamentally allowing for a peer-to-peer process of sharing. We noted how clustering can create a certain resistance to uniform spreading and centralized networks can be very effective at enabling the diffusion process through large hubs. We touched upon the network effect and how it can create rapid diffusion once a tipping point is reached due to positive externalities. Finally, we expanded our model to include complex contagion where an agent must be exposed to a number of different sources before adopting it.

**Fitness Landscape**

In this part of the book, we will be using models derived from complex adaptive systems theory to try and interpret social phenomena. Complex adaptive systems can be understood as a special class of complex system that has the capacity of adaptation. When we use this paradigm, we are essentially looking at social systems as an environment within which we have many different agents who are acting and reacting to each other's behavior as they adapt and evolve over time. A good example of this would be the world of organized crime, where we have a social system consisting of law enforcement agencies and criminal networks who each have counteracting agendas, and they are acting, reacting and adapting to each other's behavior, creating a very dynamic system.

**Adaptation**

This idea of adaptation is then central to this whole paradigm. We can define adaptation as the capacity for a system to change its state in response to some change within its environment. The system does this in order to optimize its state within that environment according to some metric. So the agent has some value system, meaning it can define a set of states and ascribe some value to them, with some of those states being better and some being worse. We might be talking about a trader in a financial system trying to make more money; a government negotiating a trade agreement; a politician trying to get elected, or criminals trying not to get arrested. All of these are examples of agents that have some value system. They are operating within some environment and they are searching for an optimal solution according to that set of criterial.

These agents are operating within some environment, and that environment is changing periodically. The agents have to adapt by finding new responses to these changes. As such, we can understand the process of adaption as a search over many different possible solutions in order to generate the most effective one, given the environmental condition.

**Adaptive Landscape**

The most coherent and robust formal model we have for understanding this process of adaptation as a search, is what is called a fitness or adaptive landscape. It is a very solid formal mathematical model we can use to describe complex adaptive systems.

In a recent paper summarizing the literature on the fitness landscape model in the social sciences, they describe the model as such: "At first sight, fitness landscapes provide a visual representation of how an agent, of any kind, relates to its environment, how its position is conditional because of the mutual interaction with other agents, and which possible routes towards improved fitness there are. The allure of fitness landscapes is first and foremost that it represents a complex story about adaptation and fitness in one coherent image that helps to summarize the many aspects of those processes in an accessible way."

**Fitness Function**

So there are a number of parameters that our adaptive landscape model needs to capture. Firstly, we need to define a parameter for how good, or fit any solution is. Every fitness landscape has to have a well-defined metric telling us which way is up and which way is down. The higher up this parameter, the more efficient the solution is and thus the better the payoff for the agent. Next, we need two more parameters in order to create a 2-dimensional space within which to put our different solution types, Those that are similar will be placed in proximity to each other within this space. So, as an example, we might be using this model to represent a military campaign. If we had two solutions based around predominantly using airstrikes we would put them in proximity, while other different strategies using ground forces would be clustered in a different location.

So when we put these three parameters together we have a three-dimensional space where the horizontal axis tells us the type of solution we are using and the vertical axis is telling us how effective that solution or state is. Now, for any application of this model, the different locations on the horizontal axes will have a different payoff ascribed to them, some will be better than others. Thus, each one will have a certain elevation based upon its efficiency. When we map out all of these elevations, we will get a landscape inside of our model, representing the solution space to that particular environment.

Now, we can put our agents into this landscape, so these agents might be countries within the international political environment. Their elevation representing their capacity to influence the global political system and those with similar political regimes and ideologies would be in proximity to each other. Or as another more concrete example, we might be modeling the different drug cartels within Mexico, where their control over territory and resources would be their elevation within the landscape.

**Explore and Exploit**

Agents are then trying to reach higher elevations within this landscape, but they typically do not have a global vision of the entire landscape. They do not know if they are on a global optimal solution or just on a local one. We do not know if we break up with our partner whether we will find a more suitable one in the future. We don't know if we overthrow the current political regime whether the next one will be any better, etc. Thus at any given time agents are faced with two different option of either exploiting their current position or investing resources in exploring for better options.

**Types of Landscapes**

So this adaptive landscape represents the different types of environments that agents are operating within, and these different environments can span from the very simple to the very complex. On the simple end of the spectrum, we are dealing with a context that is static in nature and with limited interdependencies. On the complex end of the spectrum, we are dealing with environments that are dynamic in nature, consisting of many interdependent interacting parts. I will now describe in more detail what this means by going over four of the qualitatively different types of adaptive landscapes starting with the simple and going to the complex.

**Linear Environments**

The most simple environments are static in nature and consist of the least amount of interacting variables. As an example, we might think about an absolute monarch or absolute dictatorship where all social, economic and cultural institutions are controlled and held constant through the political hierarchy. Within such an environment everything is in relation to one political institution, simply succeeding within that single organization can achieve global success. Or as another example, (Continued from page 123)

hierarchy. Within such an environment everything is in relation to one political institution, simply succeeding within that single organization can achieve global success. Or as another example, we might think about some homogeneous cultural system that defines clearly what is considered right and wrong and from this the one correct way to live one's life. These are examples of linear socio-cultural environments that would give the landscape a single dominant peak, one optimal solution that is well defined, and because of this, the agent needs only to follow some linear optimization algorithm.

**Interconnected Environments**

If we now increase the complexity by turning up the number of equally viable solutions, we will get a landscape that has many different peaks, and agents now have to invest a certain amount of time searching for the optimal position. As an example of this, we might think about a young person having completed high school choosing which university to go to. They will be trying to optimize for a number of different variables: cost of tuition, location, facilities, collage ranking etc. and thus there will be a number of different viable solutions, giving the landscape a number of different peaks, a roughed landscape. But in this situation the variables are not changing over time thus the student could invest quite a bit of time and resources in researching all of the factors involved to find whatever they consider the optimal. Although this environment may represent complicated problems in that there are a number of interacting variables that require a significant amount of computation, it is still a relatively simple environment.

**Adaptive Environment**

If we now allow for the different interacting variables to adapt and change over time we now have a complex environment. We now have a landscape where actors are acting and reacting to each other's behavior, constantly adapting. And it is out of this interdependence and adaptation that we get a landscape where the peaks and valleys are moving up and down over time. An example of this might be the current international political environment, as we move into an increasingly multipolar world. With the rise of China and the other emerging economies, we are now no longer in an international environment dominated by the homogeneous Western ideology of the Bretton Woods institutions. But increasingly have many more actors, both public and private, each with their own strategies and interest that are constantly acting and reacting to each other. And this means the end target is constantly changing any solution that may be effective now, may cease to be effective when others adapt to it, which once again alters the payoffs on the landscape as it moves up and down over time.

**Open Environments**

Lastly, this whole complex adaptive social system of agents acting and reacting is receiving some set of input values from external sources. Whether this is the natural environment or the technology infrastructure to that society. A major change in these input values can cause the whole landscape to transform. In such circumstances, we are no longer talking about the agents acting and reacting to each other, but instead, we are talking about the whole topology to the landscape transforming. This is like a paradigm shift within science or culture where the whole landscape gets changed. We can think about the paradigm shift in our culture as we moved into the modern era, everything got recontextualized, through a scientific and materialistic context. With this cultural paradigm shift, virtually every single social and cultural institution within the entire landscape had to reinvent itself within this new context. Education, governance, work, etc., everything got redefined and those that weren't have slowly lost relevance. This is a long term systemic change where we are no longer talking about adaptation but instead evolution.

To take a more contemporary example, we could think about the rise of machine learning and mass automation. Machine learning in many different areas is making the basic processing of information a commodity. We as human beings no longer have a monopoly on basic knowledge and information processing activities, which is a paradigm shift. We have for millennia had an uncontested monopoly on these activities and through it control over our environment and all other creatures. But this is rapidly changing. Within this context of a systemic transformation, we are no longer competing with each other to maintain relevance, but now the actual whole context is changing and the whole system of our society has to evolve in order to maintain relevance within this new environment.

**Adaptive Strategies**

From this, we should see that different environments require different types of adaption. Within the first simpler environment agents only need a relatively simple linear form of adaptation which is an optimization algorithm. The second environment is again algorithmic in nature, but it requires a greater investment of computation as it is no longer a simple trade-off between two variables but now a number of different variables interacting.

In neither of these first two environments does the system really have to adapt. It simply has to make an initial investment of resources exploring the environment before converging to some optimal position and can then remain there. Because the landscape is not changing, the process of exploration and adaptation is transient in nature; we only have to do it for a period of time before the system can settle into some basin of attraction.

The aim of the game here is to find the best solution and then just stay using it. You don't really have to adapt, this is like becoming the biggest fish in the pond so that no one can affect you. Or the single superpower in a monopolar political environment, so that you have significant enough resources that you don't really have to adapt to what others are doing.

When the landscape is changing in response to everyone's actions, this actually requires adaptation. You have to stay continuously responding to what other actors are doing. This is like being in a multipolar international political environment. No one is big enough just to ignore what others are doing, there are enough major players that any one of them changing their state will affect the entire landscape to a greater or lesser degree.

When the landscape is subject to systemic change, then agents must be capable of changing their entire functionality in order to be able to intercept and transform whatever new resource may be available. This requires them to be able to go through the process of evolution, which is simply a more long-term and fundamental form of adaptation. In order for agents to change their entire functionality and evolve, this requires the maintenance of a stock of redundant diversity within the system in order to be able to foster, grow and develop the new long-term solution in response to major long-term changes.

**Changing Strategies**

Strategies that work well in one environment may well fail in another and this if often a limitation to long-term sustained development. Where an agent adopts a strategy that works well in a simple environment and enables them to develop into a more complex environment, wherein they stay applying their previous strategy which works to prevent them from developing a more appropriate one for the new context. Here we can identify that success often creates a positive feedback loop, such as we have previously discussed with the phenomena of irrational exuberance, where success makes the agent overconfident in their strategy and drives them forward into a more complex environment where their strategy may be inappropriate. But the positive feedback loop of irrational exuberance limits their capacity to recognize that and change accordingly, giving us unsustainable development and this might be cited as a form of self-organized criticality.

As Albert Einstein would say; "We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them." As an example, we might think about how our industrial technologies and solutions that were developed when we had a much lower ecological impact, have taken us into a more complex environment where we are for the first time significantly altering earth's core regulatory systems, such as the climate and polar icecaps. Solving problems within this more complex environment requires a form of collaboration that our industrial systems of organization such as the nation state, that previously may have worked well, are not well designed for. The point to take away here is that strategy is context dependent. Complexity is a fundamental parameter to a system when we turn it up or down we can expect strategy to change fundamentally, requiring greater or less capacity for adaptation.

**Summary**

In this chapter, we have been looking through the lense of adaptive system theory to see what insight it can offer us on macro-social phenomena. Firstly, we talked about adaptation as a process through which an agent tries to change its state in response to some change within its environment, doing this in order to optimize its position and payoff within that environment. We gave an outline to the adaptive landscape, that can be used as a formal model for representing whole complex social systems consisting of many interacting agents both on the micro level of individuals and on the macro level of interacting organizations.

We talked about the degree of complexity to an adaptive landscape as a key parameter where as we turn it up we go from a linear environment with a single solution, to multiple solutions, to a dancing landscape, to an evolving topology representing an open system. Finally, we looked at how the agent's strategies need to change fundamentally in response to these changes in context, as they go from simple algorithms to adaptation and evolution.

**Adaptive Capacity and Resilience**

In this chapter, we will be talking about adaptive capacity, the capacity of a social system of any kind from whole societies to individuals to deal with change within their environment. This question of social adaptation becomes increasingly significant when social change affects important aspects of life over comparatively short periods of time. Such changes include migration, changes in age, rapid industrial development, or major shifts of the population from rural to urban living, which has been characteristic of the modern era.

In such times of rapid and fundamental change, it is the adaptive capacity of the social system that ensures the preservation of its structure and functionality over time, and this question of what enables or constrains the system's adaptive capacity becomes of central interest.

**Strategies**

As we have discussed in the previous chapter, agents operate within some environment. They are periodically subject to change within that environment, they have to deal with this change in some way in order to ensure the preservation of their structure and function, and their capacity to do that we would call their robustness or resilience. The question we are interested in then is how do they respond to that change, what strategy does the system use. And there are fundamentally really just tow different approaches to dealing with change. Agents can resist it, or they can adapt to it. And of course, most eventualities will involve some combination of both, but we need to understand these two different paradigms of resistance and adaptation. We will be using models from the area of cybernetics to help us in this.

**Resistance**

Adaptive systems typically have a specialized sub-system for regulating their behavior called a regulatory or control system. Examples of this include the human brain, the board or directors within a company, a national government or a military commander among many others. Regulatory systems are designed to manage the overall maintenance of the system's structure and functionality to ensure preservation and homeostasis.

All complex adaptive systems are in some way dependent upon their environment. They are what we would call thermodynamically open systems. They require the input of energy and resources in order to maintain their dynamical state - without it, they will slowly or rapidly decay. And thus the regulatory system has to ensure that the system as a whole is and will be receiving the required input values from its environment. The regulatory system then has to know what the parameters to those input values are and direct the system towards a state that will optimize them. If we are cold and there is a fire nearby, we will move towards it. If we are very poor, we will be driven to make money. If our economy requires a high input of oil, we will try and secure that resource. These are all examples of homeostasis, where the regulatory system monitors, controls and adjusts the system as a whole so as to maintain it within the optimal set of input values required to preserve and develop its level of structure and functionality. And this is the same for all complex adaptive systems.

Regulatory systems always define a desired state for the system and parameters or boundaries around that which are requisites for it to achieve that desired state. Here we are defining what the system is. That is to say, there is some structure or function through which it defines itself. This might be the identity of being Indian, of being a good person, of being an athlete of being a tough guy. But in order to be any of these things you have to stay within a certain set of parameters - you can't be a good person and take lots of drugs and steal lots of things, you can't be a tough guy and go around wearing pink flowery t-shirts all the time.

All of these identities are dependent upon a set of boundary conditions that must be maintained in order to maintain that state of functionality. In order to occupy that state, you are dependent upon those input values. When we as groups or individuals form an identity that is defining what we are, this identity also typically depends upon some resource, such as the territory that a nation occupies, the job status that an individual occupies, or a position within some social hierarchy. In defining what we are, we are also defining what we are not. We are creating some kind of boundary condition, limits to our existence. These dependencies and boundary conditions create a structure that holds the system within a certain configuration creating inertia and the resistance to change.

**Path Dependence**

The formation of identity and boundaries is often path dependent with negative externalities that create the lock-in effect. The emergence of the structure may have been initially contingent with other directions being easily feasible in the early stages. But once the structure is in place, it can be self-perpetuating, creating its own conditions for persistence. Think about the carving up of the Middle East by the colonial powers after the second world war, by drawing often arbitrary lines in the sand. But those lines in the sand would now be considered semi-sacred. Trying to now move them just a few kilometers could possibly result in a Third World War.

Once contingent historical events take place, path-dependent sequences are marked by relatively deterministic causal patterns or what can be thought of as "inertia" and this is driven by the same process we discussed before - positive feedback making it easier to continue with the same pre-existing solution and negative externalities reducing alternative options. And out of this the boundary condition gets self-perpetuated and reinforced over time.

**Resistance Strategy**

Once the adaptive system has defined a boundary condition and becomes locked into that condition, we will get Inertia - the resistance to change. Resistance as a strategy means the control system trying to limit the number of possible eventualities and maintain only a limited number of responses. In order to try and reduce the number of possible eventualities to some small subset that is conducive to the system, we have to try and control the environment. The farther we go down this path of resistance, the more we are trying to control the environment, and the more we are trying to reduce the possible input values to the system. In order to properly control a system, we have to linearize it. Nonlinearity is uncontrollable we have to externalize it from the system, in so doing reducing diversity, reducing redundant components and by linearizing it we can increase the coupling. All of these will give increases in short-term efficiency. But also, of course, this leads to long term self-organizing criticality as the system becomes more dependent upon a narrower band of input values and any small change in those critical values can create systemic shock. The classical example of this being our current dependency on petroleum, where small changes in the input value can ramify across the whole system and here again this critical state was created by path dependency, a process driven by positive feedback and negative externalities as we previously saw when we talked about carbon lock-in. But this state of inertia reduces the system's adaptive capacity and requires the heavy maintenance of a control system in order to insure that these critical values are not altered.

**Adaptation**

We have already defined adaptation as the capacity to generate some appropriate response given some environmental change. Adaptation is essentially the opposite from resistance and control. Both resistance and adaptation are methods for maintaining the system's structure and function. But control does so by reducing the number of input values to the system to the required type, by creating boundaries and exerting some external force to alter the environment. Whereas adaptation tries to ensure that the system has the appropriate response for any given input value. Adaptation means being open to a number of different eventualities. That is to say, the condition of uncertainty, and having the capacity to reconfigure the system in response to that change, without compromising critical functions.

Whereas regulatory systems will have to spend a large amount of their resources on maintaining their whole mechanism for regulation. That is to say, the means through which they amass information, define and protect boundaries, exercise control etc. Adaptation as a strategy, in contrary, is not trying to reduce the range of input values. Thus, it does not need to maintain all of this apparatus, meaning it can be a much more agile strategy.

This strategy of adaptation is then focused on ensuring the system has a sufficient number of states to generate the appropriate one when required and ensuring the competency of these components. Whereas resistance will try to remove all disturbances, adaptation comes with a recognition of the importance of disturbance in testing the system, in order to maintain the competency of the system's components. Because without control over its environment, the diversity and effectiveness of it constituent components is the only thing that is going to ensure its preservation.

As an example, we might think about the different philosophies surrounding child rearing. On the one hand, we have those parents who will believe it best to try and protect their children from every eventuality, giving them all the vaccines, not letting them play in the garden and get dirty, talk to the bad children or stay out late. And on the other hand, we have parents who believe it is necessary to expose the child to these environmental perturbations during its upbringing, in order for it to develop its adaptive capacity through overcoming these perturbations. This is of course how our bodies develop their adaptive capacity. The immune system develops by encountering interventions from antigens, having to develop the appropriate responses and then retaining a copy of those for future application. In so doing it uses these environmental perturbations to build up resilience over time.

**Edge of Chaos**

And this whole discussion ties back to the previous chapter where we touched upon the theory of the edge of chaos. The hypothesis that successful complex adaptive systems somehow maintain themselves between chaos or randomness and order, where they are exposed to perturbations that broaden the possible set of input values and remove those components that do not add to its overall adaptive capacity. The system uses the two regimes in order to configure and reconfigure itself, enabling it to evolve over time in a sustainable fashion.

**Slow & Fast Variables**

Because of emergence, complex systems like whole societies are multi-dimensional or multi-scalar. Through emergence, patterns develop on different levels and those patterns have their own internal processes taking place. This means that change is occurring on many different levels. From the micro to the macro and these processes of change are taking place in parallel, with smaller processes nested within larger ones. For example, within Western society during the past five hundred years, we have been going through the macro process of change that is modernity, representing a very fundamental socio-cultural transformation. But nested within that we have also been going through the process of industrialization for the past two hundred years approximately, and within both of these, we have the process of economic liberalization that has been taking place for the past thirty years or so.

Thus, in these complex social systems, there are many processes of change taking place in parallel. These macro processes of change typically take place very slowly. Within ecology, these are called slow variables. Micro-level processes of change happen much faster and they have fast variables associated with them. Fast variables are factors that change rapidly and that are most easily measured and manipulated by managers. Regulatory systems can try to directly influence and manage the system through fast variables, such as a central bank reducing interest rates or putting liquidity into the market in order to effect the state of the system immediately.

But we typically can not use centralized regulatory systems to manage macro processes of change. There is no government to the process of modernity. There is no board of directors to the process of globalization. These things are managed through the mechanism of evolution - they take place in a distributed fashion over prolonged periods of time. There is no centralized regulatory system that can really affect these slow variables. If the macro system has self-organized into a critical state, there is nothing you can do about that now. You can not now affect this macro situation and the slow variables associated with it by altering fast variables, the possibility of solving that problem was in the past.

Here again, we see path dependency, and again most of this can be understood in terms of positive feedback and negative externalities. These stresses on the macro level accumulate because some regulatory system on the micro level has learned to displace a lot of its problems to its external environment – quite simply, it pushes them beyond its boundaries. But it is really just pushing them onto the macro level, distorting the process of evolution and leading to macro level self organized-criticality, that it can not effect through its fast control variables on the micro level. The system might become increasingly competent at managing everything within its boundaries, through linearization and externalizing things it can’t manage well. And the big idea here is that of sustainability, which we haven't had the chance to touch upon, but we might say is the ultimate aim of adaptive capacity.

**Summary**

In this chapter, we have been discussing adaptive capacity and resilience within social systems. We talked about two different strategies for trying to manage change. Resistance and adaptation. Where resistance involves developing some static identity based upon a boundary condition and creating a regulatory system for monitoring and controlling the system's environment to ensure a limited subset of eventualities that are conducive to the system's self-preservation and continued functioning - what is called homeostasis. And it does this by amassing as much resources as possible in order to be able to exert as much control as necessary to resist any perturbation that might take it outside of those operating parameters. Inversely, we talked about adaptation as a second alternative strategy, one that is focused on the system's capacity to generate a wide set of responses, ensuring its capacity to reconfigure itself given as wide a spectrum of input values as possible, in so doing ensuring its resilience and continued functionality. We talked about how the adaptive approach is not focused on amassing resources in order to prevent change, but instead on generating the appropriate response and fast recovery from inevitable failures, thus responding to change in a constructive way as an important means through which it develops.

Finally, we discussed the multidimensional nature to complex social systems being engaged in processes of change on various levels from the micro to the macro, giving us slow and fast variables. With these fast variables being the means of centralized regulation and slow variables being the outcome to the process of long-term evolution.

**Evolution**

In this chapter, we will be discussing the process of evolution as it acts on macro-scale social systems of all kind. We will be talking about the different stages within this process, and how through this process of evolution social systems can develop to exhibit greater complexity over time.

**Complexity**

The question of what exactly complexity is, is one of the big open questions within complexity theory, as there are a number of different approaches to trying to answer it. We can, for example, talk about it in terms of computation or interconnectivity, among various other approaches. But evolution offers us one answer to this question. This perspective starts with a recognition that systems do not start out complex. All systems start out simple and evolve to become complex. Through this process of evolution, the subcomponents within the system become more specialized and differentiated, but it also involves a process of reintegration, increased interconnectivity and interdependence between those differentiated subsystems. As an example, we can think about the human body. Of course, we started out as very simple unicellular organisms like every other creature. But through a long process of evolution, different cells have come to work together while also becoming increasingly specialized. And it is through this combination of integration and differentiation during the process of evolution that our bodies have become the complex systems they are today. From this evolutionary perspective, a complex system is a system that is both differentiated and integrated, and out of that, we get synergies and the emergence of complex phenomena.

**Evolution**

The first thing to note is that evolution is not something that only happens to dinosaurs and monkeys. It is a pervasive phenomenon in our world. The mechanism of evolution in the abstract is a process of development for any type of adaptive system. Ecosystems, economies, societies, cultures, football teams, ideas, religions, political parties and the list goes on. Evolution is the same process as adaptation, but now operating on the macro scale. Adaptation is how an individual responds to change within their environment. Evolution is the process through which a whole population of agents responds to change within its environment. Both adaptation and evolution are characterized as processes of change without centralized coordination. Both adaptation and evolution do not require a centralized regulatory system. They both happen in a distributed fashion. With evolution, there is no one single divine entity that gets to make choices about which creatures will live or die. That choice is distributed out across the entire ecosystem. Just as no one in a free market economy gets to say which products will be produced or not produced, that choice is made by many different producers and consumers across the entire market as part of an evolutionary process. The point to take away is that evolution is a macro scale process of development within any adaptive system that is characterized by a distributed mechanism for selection.

Within this world of evolution, there is no right or wrong, good or bad. There is only really survival and adaptation. Survival means being able to effectively intercept and transform resources within some environment. Adaptation means being able to alter your state so as to be able to continue performing this function when the input values from the environment change. It is through being able to do both of these that you can ensure your survival. And this environment may be ecological where we are talking about some biological creature, or it may be some business within an economy, some political movement within a society, some ideology within a culture, etc. For all of these entities to survive, for them to be continued within their particular environment, they have to be intercepting and transforming resources effectively and be capable of adapting as the environment changes. If you can't do that then over time you will become irrelevant within that environment and ultimately discontinued. The whole mechanism through which this operates is called the process of evolution.

**Process of Evolution**

This process of evolution then operates through a number of key stages that need to be performed successfully for the process to be effective. Firstly, we need the production of variety in order to create new sets of possible solutions to the changing context. Secondly, those variants need to be exposed to their operating environment in order to see how effective they are within that context. And finally, we need some objective mechanism for selecting and replicating those that have been successful while discontinuing those that have not.

**Variety**

For evolution to act on any population, there needs to be variety amongst its members. In terms of socio-cultural evolution, this would mean a variety of subcultures, information and knowledge sources, political ideologies and social institutions plus the capacity to create new ones through cross mixing. Low barriers to entry would be important, enabling marginal beliefs and institutions to get a foothold and gain some exposure. The Internet is a good example of this. Allowing otherwise marginalized ideas and subcultures to get exposure through low-cost mass communication, making it easier for people to access and remix content into new cultural variants, and easily create new organizations around them. This is like the prototyping stage in design. This stage in the process will be most effective when there are lots of different building blocks, the capacity to easily remix them, putting them together and taking them apart, and having low barriers to entry so that we can rapidly deploy and test them, fail early and quick at low cost and learn fast. Internet organizations are again a good example of this. Through social networking technologies, we can very rapidly create dynamic organizations around any theme or location and collaborate at low cost, allowing for a much greater possible number and diversity of new organizations. With such low barriers to entry, we can have rapid iteration to see which might scale.

**Operation**

These different types of socio-cultural institutions need to be given the time and autonomy to develop in order to see how well they are suited to that particular context. What is needed here is a level playing field so that all variants can compete in a somewhat equal fashion. That is that all are exposed to the same environment in which they have to compete. If there is one dominant ideology, culture or political regime that is given precedence over all others, this will work to hinder the emergence of new variants that may be better suited than the existing incumbents and create a barrier to change and evolution. Here we can see the cost of unequal socio-economic opportunities, a cost that may not be borne immediately but will have a long-term detrimental effect on the system as a whole. That will again lead us into self-organized criticality on the macro scale, reducing sustainability.

Democratic political processes are an example of this. Theoretically they allow for a number of different political parties and ideologies to compete on an even playing field, but of course, this is not what always happens in practice. (Continued from page 138)

When we increase the amount of money for campaigning, we will distort this process, reducing the number of viable possibilities to those that are amenable to the interests of the economic incumbents. Again this will sooner or later reduce the solution set that the system has to respond to the challenges it is presented.

**Selection**

Although diversity and variety may be necessary for evolution and change, they also carry a cost. Once these different belief systems, cultures, social movements or other intuitions have explored the full state space of possibilities within that social context, and we have some metric for understanding which ones perform best, there then needs to be some mechanism for selecting those most successful variants and replicating them so that they will become more prevalent within the future life-cycle of the whole system, while those that have proven less effective are not replicated and left to expire. Within democracies, political parties are subject to selection at the ballot box, companies are subject to selection by their consumers, when people stop believing and spreading an ideology it becomes discontinue. But in that discontinuing, we get the release of resources that were previously occupied and the system makes space for those resources to be reconfigured through those patterns of organization that have proven most successful within this cycle of the evolutionary process.

**Sustainability**

Evolutions is not a process of luxury, it is a process of necessity of long term survival. If it is not performed, then the system's chances of survival in the long run will be degraded. And distortion to any stage, whether it involves excluding new varieties from emerging, giving them an unequal field on which to compete or distorting the selection process, will result in a degradation of the macro system leading to some form of self-organized criticality. Evolution may not give us short term optimal solutions, but what it does produce is long-term sustainability. It is a framework for how to manage the development of distributed complex systems sustainably.

**Complexity**

Through this process of evolution, the system becomes both more differentiated and integrated. As a system goes through this process of evolution, it has to develop new differentiated subsystems in order to operate in new environments. With this process of differentiation, the system comes to have more parts with those parts being more specialized and autonomous.

For example, traditional hunter-gatherer societies have only a few dozen distinct functional roles within the community, while a modern census would recognize 10,000 to 20,000 distinct occupations. But in order for the whole system to be effective and sustainable, it also has to integrate those subsystems and through the process of integration those parts become more interconnected and interdependent. Today most of the humanity is deeply interdependent through our dependence upon the global economy, within which there are many differentiated specialized functions that are highly interconnected and interdependent.

Through this process of evolution, a social system can transition from a small society with few subsystems to those that are large with many different interconnected subsystems. And this complexity enables the system to operate sustainably in a broader environment, as we have gone from local patterns of organization within simpler communities to the emerging global society of today.

**Summary**

In summary, we have been taking a brief overview to this process of evolution as it acts on macro scale socio-cultural systems. We described evolution as a distributed process through which a complex adaptive system response to change within its environment - without centralized coordination. And how through this process the system can develop over time to exhibit greater complexity, which enables it, in turn, to function within broader more complex environments. We talked about how evolution operates through a number of key stages, that need to be performed successfully for the process to be effective. Including firstly the production of variety in order to create new sets of possible solutions to the changing context; with those variants then needing to be exposed to their operating environment in order to see how effective they are within that context. And finally, we talked about the need for some objective mechanism for selecting and replicating those that have been successful while discontinuing those that have not.
