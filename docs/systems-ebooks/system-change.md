**Overview**

In a recent SSIR article, Kania and Kramer make an interesting remark: “The scale and complexity of the U.S. public education system have thwarted attempted reforms for decades... The heroic efforts of countless teachers, administrators, and nonprofits, together with billions of dollars in charitable contributions, may have led to important improvements in individual schools and classrooms, yet system-wide progress has seemed virtually unobtainable.”

This quote goes to the heart of a primary question facing both individuals, organizations and whole societies today: Why, despite the best efforts of countless public, private and civic organizations and the mobilization of vast collective resources do so many social and environmental problems remain so persistent and intractable? The best intentions and endeavors of countless individuals and organizations do not seem to sum up to the solutions on the macro-level that are now much needed. This begs the question, what are we missing?

Across the public sector, the social sector and other areas people are now starting to become aware that maybe the underlying reductionist assumptions and paradigm through which we traditionally tackle issues may not be appropriate for the scale and complexity of today's issues. In this respect the new ideas of systems change are now rising to prominence, there is now a sense that its vision, scope, and vocabulary is of a kind that is sufficiently powerful to match the complexity of the challenges at hand. By leveraging a new set of ideas we start to look at what we are doing afresh and with greater clarity that gives renewed inspiration and momentum to our endeavors to shape complex organizations towards more sustainable outcomes.

We now start to see these challenges as systemic, open-ended, co-evolving and with no known solutions requiring new ways of innovating, new ways of leading, organizing and responding. A way that leverages the power of the very complexity that creates these challenges, a way that is not incremental or linear, but holistic and networked, an approach that works with complexity rather than pushing against it.

This approach is inspired by and based upon a new way of thinking embodied in complexity theory and systems thinking. A powerful new set of ideas, that hinge around holism, systems, emergence, self-organization, nonlinearity, networks, adaptation, resilience, etc. Systems change is about changing the underlying structure to a complex system to change its behavior and outcomes. This stands in contrast to more traditional approaches that rarely question system structure but focus on changing components, events, and outcomes.

The hope is that by seeing system structure, by changing those structures and organizing in new ways, we can create patterns and institutions that better organize us in synergistic ways. So that the system's structures we inhabit don't incentivize and coordinate us in ways that have negative externalities leading to so many of the wicked problems we face but instead they have positive externalities that sum up to something greater than the sum of their parts as new types of organization emerge better suited to respond to the complex nature of today's challenges.

This book gives an overview of this new way of thinking, its methods and models, guiding you from theory to practice in an attempt to give a 360-degree view of this exciting new area with untold potential.

**Context**

The term systems change is quite a new one but it is certainly no accident that it has come to our collective vocabulary at these times. In many ways, we can recognize it as an emerging response to the conditions of our age and the way that our world has evolved over the past few decades. As such it should be of value to us to say a bit about this broader context in our endeavor to better understand systems change.

Many processes of change have transformed our world over the past several decades at a stunning pace. The growth in global population, the expansion of a standardized industrial technology infrastructure around the planet, the great acceleration of economic activity, the expansion of the market system around the world, the advent of information technology and a global telecommunications network that interconnects billions of people.

All these developments have brought us into an age of complexity, where much if not most of how our world works and how we coordinate human affairs - in terms of social institutions, economic production and exchange, technology infrastructure and our socio-ecological systems - is now mediated and interlinked by highly complex systems. These complex systems take the form of networks that span across traditional domains, jurisdictions and the boundaries of our industrial modes of organizing.

**Complex Systems**

We find ourselves in a world of complex systems that our traditional ways of thinking and organizing leave us ill-prepared to manage and direct. Our failure to understand, design or manage these complex networks, leaves us in a world of fractured industrial age systems and structures that create huge negative externalities.

In every aspect of our lives we now find that we form part of systems - be they the supply chains where our clothes come from, food systems, energy systems our political organizations or financial systems - that are fractured, where our actions have small negative externalities that accumulate on the macro-level to render them dysfunctional over time, unsustainable and leading us towards mounting crisis.

MIT professor Otto Scharmer, asks a poignant question along these lines when he says "the fact that we collectively create results that nobody wants, in almost any kind of system today, how can we make sense of that?"

Increasingly it is recognized that the failure of such systems is not an accident or the product of any one actor in the system but instead, a product of the very way the systems we inhabit and depend upon are organized with a resultant growing demand to change those systems rather than just changing any of their parts.

**A Changing Approach**

Our initial reaction to the unfolding sustainability crisis was to throw stones at the bad guys, the energy companies, corrupt politicians, the banks - to take piecemeal actions and hope that they would suffice. But in recent years such simplified solutions appear more limited in the face of the complexity of the issues and a lack of desired results.

Today leading environmental organizations, NGOs, foundations, public institutions, research centers and a growing number of individuals are starting to think differently. They are starting to look beyond the immediate pain points, asking if there is a different way to respond to the scale of the challenges that would be of an appropriate kind to match their scope.

These challenges are now increasingly recognized to be complex and interconnected. Russell Ackoff found his own terminology for these kinds of challenges “English does not contain a suitable word for ’system of problems.’ Therefore, I have had to coin one. I choose to call such a system a mess.”

"Messes" we now term "wicked problems." We now start to see these challenges as systemic, open-ended, co-evolving and with no known solutions requiring new ways of innovating, new ways of leading, organizing and responding. A way that leverages the power of the very complexity that creates these challenges, a way that is not incremental or linear but holistic and networked, an approach that works with complexity rather than pushing against it.

This approach is inspired by and based upon a new way of thinking embodied in complexity theory and systems thinking. A powerful new set of ideas, that hinge around holism, systems, emergence, self-organization, nonlinearity, networks, adaptation, resilience etc.

**Limitations**

This new thinking shines a light on the limitations of our existing approaches and why we don't seem to get the outcomes we hope for. Today if something breaks in our societal systems, we separate it out in to parts, analyze, find the faulty part and switch it out for a better one. The problem with this is that rarely does it result in the kind of change leaders hope for, instead, they are often confronted by new problems caused by the initial solution - and the initial problem might also be back and bigger this time.

This reductionist approach focuses our attention and response on separate parts, rather than asking how those parts are interrelated into the whole. As such it blinds us to the patterns and networks that we need to influence so as to drive large scale changes.

An analytical approach draws upon the past to give us a sense of the future, we start to see the world as predictable and controllable so we start to plan incremental linear progress - when rarely is it the case in complex environments - and we lose the potential for the kinds of radical nonlinear change processes that are really needed.

We fail to see the whole context within which events happen, so we think we have to change the events themselves when a much more powerful approach is to change the context. We see static snapshots so we try to shape the outcome to each new event when what is needed is to better understand the dynamic processes that shape those events.

This new approach that builds upon systems thinking is now termed "systems change". Systems change is about changing the underlying structure to a complex system to change its behavior and outcomes. This stands in contrast to more traditional approaches that rarely question system structure but focus on changing components, events, and outcomes.

The hope is that by seeing system structure, by changing those structures and organizing in new ways, we can create patterns and institutions that better organize us in synergistic ways. The aim is to change the system's structures that we inhabit so that they don't incentivize and coordinate us in ways that have negative externalities leading to so many of the wicked problems we face but instead they have positive externalities that sum up to something greater than the sum of their parts as new types of organizations, functionality and desirable outcomes emerge.

**What is Systems Change?**

The term systems change is a relatively new one, coming to prominence within just the last decade, as such it is safe to say that it is still in its formative stage with many different perspectives on what it is exactly. We may find many people using the same term but depending on their background it means many different things. Before we start let us take a look at a number of these interpretations.

Ashoka defines systems change in terms of tackling root causes: "Systems change is an approach to tackling the root causes of a problem by identifying and creating shifts in the systems that are responsible for the problem." [1]

The author and advisor Charlie Leadbeater talks about it in terms of transformation and new rules: "Innovations which are transformative and generative; which change the rules of the game, create new relationships and create, with that, new flows and resources through society." [2]

Forum for the Future's definition is in terms of changing systems pattern or structure: "System change is the emergence of a new pattern of organization or system structure. That pattern being the physical structure, the flows, and relationships or the mindsets or paradigms of a system, it is also a pattern that results in new goals of the system." [3]

John Kania, who developed the systems change practices at New Profit, talks about it in terms of shifting the system conditions when he says: "We're thinking about systems change not as an issue or a person that needs to be fixed… it's the set of conditions that surround that individual. We need to work on shifting the conditions that hold the problem in place." [4]

**Complexity**

In many ways, we can see the rise of systems change as a response to the growing complexity of the challenges faced by societies around the world. As a function of this complexity, we are moving from a world where one organization could drive changes to a world where that is no longer possible because of the scale, interconnectivity, and complexity of the issues today.

The reality is that when you are addressing large-scale complex challenges and you are sincerely motivated to find solutions then one quite quickly realizes that what you need are methodologies that are significantly different from current ones. New innovation methodologies, different mindsets, you need a new kind of leadership, you also need different ways of collaborating and organizing people around a given issue.

As Kyle Peck says: "Systemic change is an approach to change that acknowledges the complexity of the way the world really works." Systems change embodies this realization and draws upon a new set of ideas from complexity and systems thinking to provide an approach that is more appropriate given the complexity of these issues.

It is precisely the complexity of today's issues that defies traditional transactional or singular interventions; allowing the problem to perpetuate, be it climate change, homelessness, conflict, segregation, or intergenerational poverty.

For those who are really committed to dealing with these "wicked problems" the emphasis shifts to the structure of the systems that are creating the problems rather than just dealing with the symptoms. As James Greyson of BlindSpot Think Tank remarks: "If we were totally serious about climate change, then actually we would be looking at something much more systemic. We would actually be seeing climate change as a symptom, not just as a cause and the symptom being a result of the way that we run the world. The way that we set up the systems that we all live within because currently, they are setup to cause climate change and a range of other problems."

**Multidimensional**

Seeing and tackling these "root causes" derived from systems structure requires a more holistic way of seeing the world. Systems change is based upon the paradigm and ideas of systems thinking which is a holistic view of the world; we are always reasoning upwards to try and understand a system within its whole environment and context. This holistic approach allows us to recognize the many dimensions and facets to a system, to embrace this complexity rather than trying to reduce it.

Jocelyne Bourgon expresses this key multidimensionality tenant of systems change when he says: "Complex issues are multidimensional and whenever you try and reduce them to a single dimension you are on the verge of making a dramatic mistake because by prescribing a solution that is unidimensional you are about to make the problem even worse."

Systems change is a response to the complexity of the world we live in and with that an acceptance that there is no "silver bullet." Indeed it is a recognition that such a narrow approach often makes the problem worse in the long run.

Systemic change is a change that takes into account all the various pieces that influence a system, that means the people, the politics, the values, the reward systems, and the many other factors. Too often we see social interventions that are ‘service-rich and system-poor.’ People are bombarded by interventions from different providers, all of which add up to less than the sum of the parts. It is the system itself that pushes people into difficult situations or prevents them from getting out and no simple summation of isolated interventions adds up to systems change.

**Holistic Approach**

This holistic approach is very important as a starting condition when dealing with complex systems. As Petra Kuenkel, director of the Collective Leadership Institute, notes: "Wholeness, at a large scale, is our ability to look at things from a distance and to take into account a larger perspective, because if we don't do this we do not only act in isolation, we may act in the naivety that the positive intention that we have will have a positive impact and it may not necessarily be the case, because we have not taken into account a larger context." [5]

Systems thinking, as the foundation for systems change, is important because it helps to elevate our thinking to the systems level. When we can do this our approaches can become radically more innovative and effective.

Think about a transport system, we see a bus passing, it is overloaded with people, so we think "Oh, the transport authorities should put on more buses." This is a scarcity mindset that is inherent to a component-based vision of the world. If we can elevate our thinking and vision to the systems level we might start to see the bus as part of an overlapping set of different networks. This vision would let us see that maybe instead it is a product of the lack of coordination between the different transport modes that creates bottlenecks. This, in turn, would lead to us developing an alternative strategy, perhaps to restructure the system by better understanding the networks of connections and connecting things in new ways, then maybe we would not need more buses. Indeed our initial solution based upon a partial view of the system may well have made things worse, by adding congestion and perpetuating a system that had structural dysfunctionalities.

A central premise here is that people have to become aware of the systems they form part of before they can operate on that level and start to effect change at that level. Indeed it is precisely this that we are struggling with as societies; that we are not really aware of the complex systems we are a part of or how they work, which means we have little to no capacity to intentionally shape them. The result of this is that all we can do is react to unforeseen events when they occur and then create some rationale as to why they occurred so that we feel like we are in control.

Petra Kuenkel puts it well when she remarks: "any sustainability challenges we are dealing with, they are actually a result of a fragmented way of thinking... so can we take [our thinking] one level up so that we can defragment the thinking so that we can defragment the actions." [6]

**Nonlinear Change**

Systems change is a theory of change that is nonlinear. It is based upon complexity and systems theory's understanding of complex nonlinear organizations and how they change over time. This nonlinear approach stands in contrast to most theories of change that are based upon certain assumptions of linear causality; stability, predictability and the capacity to directly affect the system toward changing in a prespecified desired direction.

The dominant, mechanistic paradigm we live with today views change as something that can be “managed” through centralized, top-down design processes that produce clear, predictable outcomes. This type of linear cause-and-effect thinking has influenced the design and development of our Industrial Age institutional arrangements that contribute to many of the global wicked problems we face today.

A new cross-domain collection of knowledge dealing with the dynamics of change within complex systems is now emerging that challenges these assumptions and has the potential to create new approaches to management, design and problem-solving. Insights from a diversity of fields such as mathematics, physics, ecology, sociology, and organizational development have revealed that change within open, complex systems takes place in counterintuitive ways. Although change within such organizations can be stimulated and even lightly directed, it cannot be managed or controlled, nor can outcomes be precisely predicted. [7]

Acceptance of the nonlinear nature to complex organizations and the fact that we can not directly change them through linear causal interaction leads to a new approach to change and a whole new kind of strategy. The strategy of the systems changer is about identifying "leverage points" and then performing "systems acupuncture" to strategically influence those important points in the system, where small interventions can have long term lasting effects. Systems change eventuates when the interventions are made in the right place, given the right motives and combined in the right way. This is about shifting the conditions that hold the problem in place and it takes multiple synchronized and coordinated interventions at leverage points that are often found at counter-intuitive places in the system and typically not easy to find.

**Collaboration**

Systems change is certainly not a theoretical exercise, it aims at actually changing the complex systems that make our economies and societies work - or not work as the case may be. Thinking in systems, having a holistic view, identifying leverage points and formulating a strategy is just the beginning.

The aim is to build ecosystems of actors that have a shared understanding of the system making them capable of collective action. These ecosystems of actors need to develop shared system diagrams to build everyone's awareness; to build shared language. This is about building the collective intelligence of the group and their collective agency.

Beyond awareness, these platforms need to have agency through collaborations that enable a diversity of actors across the system to start to synchronize their activities in synergistic ways. Platforms for system change work to build systems awareness through bringing people together, creating structures that enable them to work together, make collaboration an attractor and demonstrate value to the stakeholders. Likewise, they have to build adaptive learning feedback loops for the network to explore and learn about the problem and possible solutions.

Collaborative change requires building shared understanding, shared language and ultimately some form of collective intelligence. This starts with recognizing the other actors and the need to work together, then coordinating, collaborating, synthesizing; the result is the emergence of some new functional pattern in the system. As Co-impact highlights in their approach: "Systems change is about realigning the underlying relationships, functions, incentives, and motivations to a higher (outcome-focused) equilibrium." [8]

**Examples**

Systemic innovations can be suddenly pushed forward by a crisis, cultural changes or disruptive technology among other things. More often they are the result of slow but cumulative processes entailing changing infrastructures, behaviors and cultures that reach a tipping point, at which stage large scale systems changes happen very fast; the fall of the Berlin Wall is but one such often cited example of systems change.

Other examples may include the Civil Rights movement in the US, the creation of welfare states in the mid 20th century, the spread of democracy. One of the most recent, large scale and dramatic illustrations of systems change may be the rapid spread of the market system around the world with the rise of economic globalization in the 90s and the changes in patterns of work, economic conditions, power and culture that it has resulted in for billions of people.

However, none of these processes of systems change were on the strategic level that we are looking for today; they changed systems, yes, but not in the strategic fashion we will be outlining in this book. Today we are searching for a more conscious and strategic way to influence and shape complex organizations when needed. It can be easily argued that examples of people doing such a thing, at the scale required, does not yet exist.

Systems change with intentionality, where we really bring new ideas and thinking together with deep insight and analysis combined with the formation of platforms for collaboration that drive comprehensives systems-level change within a large complex system such as the global food system or energy system, this has not been realized at scale yet.

We have changed systems but we have never really consciously and strategically changed one of the kinds of global systems - to a higher equilibrium - that ultimately need to be changed if we are going to realize sustainable outcomes for all. Such things it could be argued are largely beyond us today and thus true examples probably do not exist yet, but hopefully lie somewhere in the future. We might say that it is part of the systems change movement to bring them into being as an example of possible ways forward.

We highlight this in an attempt to ensure that systems change remains an active endeavor on all levels, both on the small scale but also on the largest scales possible. In a talk by Indy Johar, he framed the situation well by saying "The scale of change, if we want to survive as a global civilization, will be of an order that is unimagined, let us start the conversation from that perspective." [9]

**Section 1: Change**

In this section, we are going to explore the nature of change within complex organizations. The first thing to note is how complex organizations change is fundamentally different from our traditional linear conception of change management. Nonlinear systems of all kind are marked by discontinuous processes of change, what are called phase transitions, where the structure of the whole system changes as a new overall pattern emerges and the old pattern disintegrates.

Our traditional understanding of how change happens is that we - or someone - imposes that change based upon some preconceived plan. However as we will discuss in this section, systems change is not like this, with systems change we are always working with the change potential of the system rather than imposing a preconceived plan on it.

Although this process of change may not be linear and predictable in detail it is not random and we can say something about the general pattern that complex systems adhere to as they evolve. If we do not understand that they are changing and how they are changing then we will fall into the trap of thinking that we need to change them directly ourselves; which is an impossibility and the surest way to waste our time, energy and resources.

The better we understand how complex adaptive systems change the more we will see that we do not need to directly change them ourselves. For this reason, it is critically important that we start with an understanding of how this process of change plays out in complex organizations.

**Theory Of Change**

Systems change is about changing complex organizations, it is thus before anything what we would call a "theory of change" - it will give us a set of ideas and methods about how to do change in complex environments. People have been thinking about how to do change within organizations long before we came up with the idea of systems change, so a good place to start is by first understanding a little about theories of change in general so that we can better position systems change in its broader family and see how and why it is unique.

The Center for Theory of change tells us that a "Theory of Change is essentially a comprehensive description and illustration of how and why the desired change is expected to happen in a particular context." [10] Quite simply theories of change are the essential plan as to how we are going to get from where we are to where we want to be.

NPC in their paper entitled Creating your Theory of Change break this down a bit farther noting "a theory of change is a scheme to help us describe the need you are trying to address, the changes you want to make (your outcomes), and what you plan to do (your activities)." [11]

A theory of change is always present within a planned course of action, whether it is explicitly acknowledged or not. What we wish to do here is make as much explicit as possible so that we can be clear about it and know the assumptions involved. This gives us the capacity to question whether those are valid assumptions and whether the whole thing makes sense or where the issues might lie.

Often organizations wish to see a change, they will have an idea about what they would like to see as the outcome, their view of the world is based upon some assumptions, and they take some actions but there is little coherent connection between them, because they are not really aware of them as a whole.

As such a theory of change is a powerful tool that helps organizations articulate the connection between their actions and their mission. It aims to give an outline of both the assumptions involved in supporting the change process and the actions that will lead to the desired outcome. The theory of change defines long-term goals and then maps backward to identify necessary preconditions. Through theories of change actions and the achievement of the long-term goals can be better understood, connected and articulated.

A theory of change is often illustrated by a diagram or chart which should help us to consider and communicate the assumptions and enablers that surround our initiatives and explain why we think our activities will lead to desirable outcomes. [12]

**Simple and Complex**

Theory of Change developed from the field of program evaluation in the 1990s as a new way of analyzing the theories motivating programs and initiatives working for social change. [13] Since then the use of the Theory of Change in planning and evaluation has increased hugely among, NGOs, philanthropies, government agencies, etc. Change processes are now no longer seen as linear, but as having many feedback loops that need to be understood, with links to complexity and systems thinking now forming.

Theories of change can be simple and linear in their assumptions taking the form of logic models and log frames or even gantry charts, involving linear causal relationships, or if-then relationships. However, systems change is based upon the assumption that the system we are dealing with is not amenable to this kind of linear process of change but is a search for a different form of change that would be relevant for more complex nonlinear change processes. With nonlinear processes of change, one thing does not lead sequentially to another, but instead, outcomes emerge out of the underlying structure of the system, the way the parts are interrelated.

Theories of change make the connection between what we are doing and the changes we want to see, this remains the same even when dealing with complex systems. So a theory of change still applies, we are still acting strategically to change a system and we need to be aware of the assumptions we are making, where we want to go to and our general approach. The intervention however is now no longer a linear process, it is one that instead is based around the nonlinear process of emergence.

Although change in a complex organization is nonlinear we still need some theoretical grounding to structure our thinking as to how change happens and this is what we will look at in the coming three modules as we look at the adaptive cycle, the two-loop model and transition theories.

---

**Adaptive Cycle**

The adaptive cycle is a heuristic model developed by C.S. Holling for understanding macro processes of change in ecosystems, however, the adaptive cycle is equally applicable to any complex adaptive system. It can be used to identify structural patterns in both ecosystems as well as social systems as they go through nonlinear processes of change. Systems change is about changing complex adaptive systems - i.e. living systems - so understanding these inherent processes of change in living dynamical systems will be of great value.

The model describes how complex adaptive systems evolve in terms of four phases, with these four phases being exploitation, conservation, release, and reorganization.

**Exploitation**

The first stage of exploitation is one of a new environment, it is one of growth, a time of expansion and increasing complexity. A system in the exploitation-stage has successfully reoriented post-crisis and there is now plenty of freely available resources for rapid growth and development. A time dominated by positive feedback and self-organizing processes of assembly. This is a period often marked by abundant resources and entrepreneurial leadership as the environment has plentiful untapped and uncommitted potentiality, which is waiting to be reconfigured into new possibilities.

Once kick-started along a growth trajectory, many resource flows are available for experimentation. In the r-stage, network connections are established and interdependencies are built. At this stage, positive feedback can work to take hold of some emergent pattern and rapidly scale it up, as might be seen with the exponential growth of a start-up company as it rides the positive feedback loop of economies of scale.

**Conservation**

The conservation stage is a state of equilibrium, it is about controlled development and this ‘equilibrium’ is a time of stability. The system has reached a high level of complexity and connection between its parts.

A mature system in the conservation stage dynamically performs at a high level of activity and can be seen to be optimal, exhibiting strong stability. At this stage, negative feedback cycles dominate over positive feedback, but as the system settles into a stable configuration there is the possibility of rigidity forming.

Characteristics of a rigid system include very few key nodes with a high concentration of influence, and low diversity both in nodes and pathways. Additionally, a rigid system is brittle and vulnerable to disturbance because of reduced diversity and inability to self-organize.

This mature act of specialization weakens resilience by permitting systems to become accustomed to and dependent upon their prevailing conditions. In the event of unanticipated shocks; this dependency reduces the ability of the system to adapt to these changes.

The system may become rigid and seemingly indestructible, but stagnation and a lack of flexibility may eventually make the system vulnerable to destruction by an external disturbance.

**Release**

The release phase is one of crisis and collapse when the system is destroyed by an external disturbance. Positive feedback generates dramatic change, and the system falls apart as It is pushed out of its stability domain.

The test of a system in the release state is its capacity to survive in the face of extreme disturbance or disordered collapse. A system must maintain vital functions throughout the crises.

One of the ways that the diversity maintained through small-scale disturbances contributes to the resilience of the system is by cultivating a large stock of resources from which it can pull during a crisis, both in terms of organizations and their relationships, which is essential for leadership to emerge during the release-stage.

Emergent leadership occurs when actors not tasked with leadership roles informally assume key positions during the crisis. Failure to survive this stage can result in a complete breakdown of the system cycle.

**Reorganization**

Reorganization is a time when the system begins to recover from falling apart. It is a creative time when change can take a variety of possible directions; that is, the system has the possibility of moving into a variety of new stability domains. [14]

‘Chance’ can be important to the way the system reorganizes, determining which new stability domain it enters. The growth stage that follows reorganization depends on the course initiated during re-organization. To reorient after crises, the system must reorganize and reconnect these pathways and node relations.

The release stage provides opportunities for new elements to enter and become more prominent in the system, be they species, nutrients, individual people, citizen groups or institutions. At this stage in the cycle, the probability of several alternative future states is high.

The complex adaptive system can reorganize and return to its former regime, shift to a different regime with similar structure but with changes in feedbacks and dominant processes, or transform into a new regime with novel state variables and feedbacks. As novel societal or ecological groups assemble, some succeed and others fail, and the adaptive cycle may then be repeated.

**Conclusion**

The adaptive cycle is a heuristic model that tells us something about the different stages of the process of evolution. We need to understand these inherent dynamics of complex adaptive systems because this is how we change them. As noted no one can change such a system we have to instead work with this adaptive cycle to enable it to evolve in a certain direction. Without understanding these inherent cycles or where the system might be in we have little chance of working with those dynamics and will likely exert our resources in the wrong direction without success.

**Two Loop Model**

The Two Loops Theory of organizational change is a model of change that tries to describe nonlinear emergent processes of change within complex organizations. It is a model inspired by looking at the growth and decline cycle of living systems.

Margaret Wheatley & Deborah Frieze from The Berkana Institute first pointed to this model in their paper entitled “Using Emergence to Take Social Innovation to Scale.”

Frieze and Wheatley demonstrated a key dynamic at the heart of every organization transformation, how "as one system culminates and starts to collapse, isolated alternatives slowly begin to arise and give way to the new." [15]

As with all living systems they are born, they grow, peek and then start to decline, ie they have a lifecycle. In contrast, our more mechanistic view of the world is that something can just go on operating indefinitely and if there is a problem we can always intervene and fix it.

This may be true for a machine but unfortunately, we bring this same kind of thinking to our organizations, when in fact organizations are more like living systems rather than machines; they change in a nonlinear process, similar to that of the growth and decay of ecosystems. This simple insight can turn out to be quite powerful and help us to avoid common pitfalls that stem from a linear mechanistic view of the world.

**Loss**

The Two Loops Model highlights how we need to look at both the growth and the decay sides of transformation. If we want to launch a successful organization transformation effort, we need to support the disintegration cycle and the germination cycle in the overall process. This model highlights a key issue that our job as systems changers is not all about creating the new, it is as much about helping the existing system decay with dignity so that the new system can emerge.

With complex systems we never really get to start from a clean slate, when changing systems there is a massive weight of highly invested stakeholders that have the mass of resources and expertise, these people have dedicated their lives to building up the existing system, it's structures and processes and we are now trying to challenge that way of working while at the same time we need to move those resources to the new pattern.

We are navigating the loss of a system that maintains the way of life for many people, at an organizational level or a sector level we're asking people to do things that are uncomfortable and difficult for them. [16]

Take for example tackling homelessness within a given city. As a collaboration to end homelessness at least one of us in the room will be a homelessness provider, getting paid to provide refuge and if we are successful in our purpose we will likely be putting them out of business, yet at the same time, they have to align with the overall purpose.

Real lasting change is democratic, it involves people in creating their own future, the alternative is a dictatorship and dictatorships are inherently unsustainable. Systems change is a commitment to sustainable ways of operating and at the heart of that is a commitment to non-dictatorial modes of change and leadership.

We have to get everyone involved both the old and the new and this means learning how to navigate the loss of the old at the same time that we are supporting the new, aiming to create structures that will enable that. The two-loop model will help us with this as it helps us to recognize the underlying dynamics at play.

**Model**

The model as a whole describes two "loops." The first of these is used to represent the growth and subsequent decline of the existing incumbent systems. The second loop is used to represent the new emerging next generation of this system.

The model as a whole describes the transition or process of nonlinear change from the old system to the new. By nonlinear we mean that it is discontinuous, there is no linear set of steps that will take us from the old to the new, but instead, there exists some phase transition that engenders a qualitative change in the process of getting from the old to the new.

**Growth**

Looking at the first loop we can see its rise, peak, and fall. In this initial rise faze something is being brought into the world and it needs what we might call "stewarding." It needs leadership, new structure, resources, and fostering.

As this pattern develops and reaches its ascendancy the system becomes the dominant mode of organization, the "establishment." Those in the system become increasingly locked into a dominant paradigm that describes the world and the centrality of their place within it. At the peak is often a false sense of permanence, a delusion that things will go on getting better ad infinitum, with little imagination for any other possibility.

Those farther from the center with an impartial view may well see the system is about to enter into decline. At this point, there may be the signs of the first divide in the system between those assuming things will continue as such forever and those that start to plan for its demise.

As time progresses and the system declines, those wedded to the regime will continue under the assumption that nothing has changed as the gap between their belief and the underlying reality widens.

One could point to countless examples of this in business and politics, the providers of the mainframe computer could not see the personal computer coming or dictators claiming their rein will go on forever just before their downfall.

**Decline**

As the system enters into decline what is now needed is hospicing, this requires attending to the emotional and spiritual needs of the individuals or organization, helping them to develop alternative narratives that lets them accept reality and let go of the past. However, hospicing capacity will be limited if the system is still in denial.

Finally, when an organism or organization dies it needs to be decomposed, meaning that the resources that it contained for its operation need to be released back to the broader system for the generation of the new pattern.

The fulfillment of this process takes a great effort of leadership as it involves letting go of the past and giving over to the future system, giving up one's power, control, and resources to a new pattern of organization. This is something that we rarely see in organizations on a large scale, more often we see denial, resistance, and fighting before acceptance of the new.

As the German philosopher, Arthur Schopenhauer describes it "All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident."

One colorful illustration of this is Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan and his evolving relationship with the digital currency Bitcoin. In early 2014 Dimon started his career in bitcoin commentary at the World Economic Forum, labeling the cryptocurrency a “terrible store of value” and suggesting that the Wall Street bank would stay as far away as possible. As he said, “The question is, do we even participate [with] people who facilitate bitcoin?” [17]

Shortly after he said “No government will ever support a virtual currency that goes around borders and doesn’t have the same controls,” adding “It’s not going to happen.” A little after he came to the conclusion that “It’ll eventually blow up. It’s a fraud, OK?”

The subsequent years saw a transition from denial and resistance to acceptance until by 2019 JPMorgan had made a complete U-turn when the head of digital treasury services and blockchain at the bank, said: “We have always believed in the potential of blockchain technology and we are supportive of cryptocurrencies..."

**Second loop**

In transitions something new is always born, however, it may look very different from the old. What is important is that we try to grasp the full scope of change and not limit our imagination or ambitions. Often the old regime will get a sense for the new and try to copy it based upon the old logic and many may well accept this as the new even though it is still supported by an underlying system that is disintegrating. The example of JP morgan's digital currency launched in 2019 - over ten years later than the creation of the original digital currency bitcoin - may come to mind here.

Or more broadly we can think about the current state of financial technology, fintech, where incumbent banks that hear about the new and wish to be seen as innovative, will buy some fintech startups to make their web site or mobile app look flashy.

Ultimately it is the whole system that is falling to bits and it is those that are outside of it that will really understand the full context of the new and build something that is aligned with that which will prevail.

Sometime around the peak of the old system new alternatives to the dominant approach emerge. Outside innovators are there because they saw the decline of the old and left, or maybe because they have always been left out, or because they represent a younger generation who have grown up into a new set of possibilities that simply make sense to them because they are not conditioned by the old logic.

It is when the pioneers of the new innovations start to get connected to each other that an alternative starts to emerge and they start to give rise to an alternative pattern.

Networks form when people search for each other to meet their personal needs. Places emerge where people inspired by the new innovations can connect informally to follow their interests. Throughout history, these places have taken many forms, the Greek forum, Florence Italy, Parisian cafes, the night clubs of Berlin, Silicon Valley, or the online communities of today.

However, a network of such kind is not going to create a sustainable long-lasting or influential organizational structure as it is too diffuse and incoherent to challenge the prevailing **Starting Transcription of PDF**

I've begun the verbatim transcription of the "Systems Change - An Introduction" PDF, starting with the title page. I'm methodically working through the document, capturing each page's content as instructed. I'm now at the Contents section, preparing for the overview.


**Charting Continued Progress**

\n\n

I'm now diving into Section 3, focusing on Horizon Scanning, Subjective Change, and Theory U. I am methodically working through the concepts. The transcription also includes Systems Leadership, Narrative, and Section 4's introduction. We've progressed beyond the initial stages. The work has also begun on Leverage Points, the Multi Level Perspective, Systems Aikido, Social Acupuncture, Systems Gardening and Systems Entrepreneurship. I've now completed section 5 and am currently working on the conclusion. My latest updates include the colophon and the references section.


**Expanding the Transcription Scope**

\n\n

My transcription efforts are broadening significantly. I've now completed the initial concepts and sections. Currently, I'm immersed in Section 2, specifically page 29 through 47, covering critical aspects of mapping. This includes delving into Bifurcation, Collapse, Emergence, Holistic Perspectives, and various mapping methods like Systems Mapping, Feedback Loops, Stocks and Flows, Archetypes, and stakeholder dynamics. This section's depth is revealing a more comprehensive understanding of the systems.


**Incentive & Value Mapping**

\n\n

I'm now fully engaged with Incentives Mapping, continuing its detailed transcription through page 50. I've finished that, moved on to Models, Value Mapping, and the importance of Shared Language. Page 52's Value Mapping is now in progress. My focus is still on verbatim transcription and accurately capturing each page's content, following the previous section's style. I've revisited page 25's paradigm shift and am methodically transcribing through page 27's transitions.


**Expanding Document Scope**

\n\n

I'm now methodically transcribing pages 25 through 52. The goal is now to cover the bulk of that section. I'm focusing on capturing the relevant text, skipping page numbers and other non-content elements as instructed. I'm ensuring accuracy and completeness in this broader transcription scope. I'm also now capturing page 25's text from "However, a network of..." and the remainder of the passage. My transcription cadence is now optimized for efficiency in this significantly larger undertaking.


**Identifying Network Evolution**

\n\n

My focus is now on the evolution of networks. I've been pondering how individual needs morph into a central, organizing pattern – a community of practice.  This leads me to consider the sustainability of a new system through shared purpose and resource allocation. The process of transitioning from the old system to the new, is key. I'm exploring the point where a new system of influence emerges, illuminating a fresh perspective that draws mass adoption. I'm thinking about the process of naming, connecting, nourishing, and illuminating to create the new system.


**Examining Systemic Intersection**

\n\n

I'm now deeply engaged with the intersection of the old and new systems.  The core challenge lies in navigating the inherent complexity where these paradigms collide.  I'm grappling with the "living and dying" aspects of the old system's disintegration while the new one takes root.  My focus is on understanding the integration required during this transformative process, especially the potential disruption to individuals. The challenge of integrating simultaneous realities is the core work.


**Connecting Paradigms Holistically**

I'm now focusing on the intersection and interdependence of old and new systems. Meaningful change requires a holistic approach, which I'm defining as acknowledging and integrating both paradigms. I'm exploring how to conserve essential aspects of the old while creating innovative solutions, echoing Charles Leadbeater's insight. The goal is to navigate the "living and dying" aspects of a system's shift constructively and avoid collapse. The Two Loop model offers a valuable framework for this.


**Refocusing on Transcription Scope**

\n\n

My current focus is on expanding the transcription of Section 2. I'm restarting from page 25 to ensure completeness, meticulously capturing text like "challenge the prevailing". I'm also including the small amount of text from page 43 about the fish example to maintain accuracy. I'm formatting it clearly to meet the requested style. **Analyzing Systems Change Content**

I'm deep into transcribing the "Systems Change: An Introduction" document. I've successfully extracted the content up to the bottom of the current OCR. The process is meticulous, ensuring accuracy with each word. The formatting is being preserved wherever possible, making it easier to read.


**Charting System Archetypes**

I've just finished transcribing the crucial sections on stock and flow diagrams, exploring their graphical representations. The current focus is the introduction to Systems Archetypes, starting with 'Limits to Growth' and then moving on to 'Shifting the Burden'. I'm also carefully noting the story of the Kenyan lake to understand how it illustrates the 'Tragedy of the Commons'. The diagrams are being incorporated for completeness.


**Delving into Game Theory**

I've just begun transcribing the material on incentives and game theory. The concepts of zero-sum and non-zero-sum games are really grabbing my attention, especially the basketball and trade examples. I'm keen on understanding the role of external enforcement. The mental models discussion, particularly the quotes from Robert Pirsig and Peter Senge, is also striking a chord. The introduction to "Envision" marks a shift towards normative and exploratory forecasting. I'm excited to continue this deep dive.


**Reflecting on Systems Leadership**

I've just covered key leadership concepts, including the shift from ego-system to eco-system thinking. I'm focusing on "Holding Space" and the role of paradox in systems leadership, grappling with the challenge of recognizing oneself as part of the problem. Also, I’m connecting responsibility and uncertainty. The narrative elements of systems change, with quotes from Saltmarshe, Stroh, and Monnet, resonate deeply. I am pondering how identity is adaptive.


**Exploring Strategic Approaches**

I'm now immersed in the chapter on strategy, specifically section 4. I've covered obliquity, and artful interventions, delving into Meadows' leverage points. Currently, I'm examining the first two leverage points and the Iceberg model. The Multi-Level Perspective, landscape, and regime are the current focus. I'm also considering systems Aikido and social acupuncture. The farmer vs. engineer perspective is now entering my consciousness.


**Mapping Innovative Strategies**

I've just reviewed page 84, considering probes, attractors, and dispositional versus causal systems. I'm noting the importance of communities of practice and creative integrity with the Ashoka example. I'm now exploring the strategic business model from page 86, and examining the systems investing model on page 87. Also, the collaboration-over-capital funding model is now front and center, along with the Papi-Thornton pitching example on page 88.


**Defining Transformational Platforms**

I'm now fully immersed in the Collaborative chapter, scrutinizing the five conditions of Collective Impact. Context is now king as I explore the concept of ecosystems. System entrepreneurs are coming into focus as keystones, emphasizing a holistic viewpoint. I'm noting the traits of effective individuals as well as Indy Johar's four essential actions. The scaling sections redefine the process as I move toward platform discussions.


**Completing Reference Compilation**

I'm diligently working through the final pages, meticulously transcribing the references and publication information on pages 108 through 119. Ensuring perfect accuracy in this section is paramount. I’m focusing on maintaining consistent formatting and skipping the page numbers, as they are redundant. The completion of this section marks the closing of the transcription process, and I am satisfied with the thoroughness of the work.

of both companies, as well as the fish provided to the community. It also harms the fish population and perhaps the whole lake ecosystem.[26]

**Success to the Successful**

This describes a dynamic where two people or activities require the same limited resources. As one of them becomes more successful, more resources are assigned to them. However, now the second one becomes less and less successful due to lacking resources, this “proves the right decision” to support the first one. Problems arise if the competition is unproductive and interferes with the goals of the whole system. The two activities or agents might be decoupled or they should receive a balanced amount of resources. Examples may be seen with a company that has two products giving success to the one that was initially successful.[27]

These are all recurring patterns seen in systems mapping, by understanding the generic underlying dynamic we can quickly use it to map out another system that exhibits similar behavior or symptoms.

---

**Stakeholder Mapping**

Stakeholder mapping involves mapping out the various individuals or organizations that have a part in the system we wish to change. Stakeholders have a stake in the outcomes to the organization and thus an interest in shaping events according to their stake. With stakeholder mapping, we are asking who are the individuals or organizations that have an influence in determining the pattern and outcomes of the system and who are influenced by it.

If we take something like the energy system we will see many actors, such as regulators, policymakers, incumbent providers, startups, engineering companies, etc. each will have something to gain or lose depending on the outcome, which gives them a stake and also a desire to shape that outcome in a particular way.

Often systems over time evolve towards a state of equilibrium between these different stakeholders' interests and influence. The objective of analyzing the field in this way is to understand the formal and informal structures that have led to the current situation and to examine which structures and behaviors are currently impeding or could enable the change process.[28]

Organizations are composites of beliefs, rules, incentives and physical resources and we need to think about and map them out along these various dimensions. To map out the system's stakeholders:

*   We need to define the scope of the project and system.
*   Create a list of stakeholders who form part of the system.
*   Determine the influence of the actors - which members are influential, important or have potential.
*   Identify their importance according to different dimensions of influence e.g. resources, decision making, leadership, etc.
*   Place the stakeholders on the map, scaling them according to their level of importance.
*   Map out the flows between them, this could be a financial exchange, physical goods, communication, trust, influence, etc.

Now step back and look at the map from the perspective of the different actors involved.

**Information flows**

To get any form of organization, people have to communicate. Thus the way that people are connected is critical to the way that organizations operate, what gets said, who has a say, who hears what etc. A society or organization without electronic broadcast media is very different from one with, and a society with nonlinear networked communication is again very different from one based upon linear flows of communication.

As Marshall McLuhan said, "The medium is the message" positing that a medium itself, rather than the content it carries, should be the primary focus of study. He said that a medium affects the society in which it plays a role not only by the content delivered over the medium but also by the characteristics of the medium itself.[29]

Our existing institutional structures that are centralized and vertical are a product of linear communications; where information flows into the center, is processed and sent back out for executing upon. Without information flowing in different directions, it would be very difficult to change this. Nonlinear networked forms of communication now make possible new forms of organization via the production and dissemination of information.

This can be a powerful leaver for systems change as we have and already are witnessing. The introduction of social networking technologies into many societies with brittle political systems is now having a real impact as people can have their voices heard and start to organize peer to peer. It is when people come together that they feel empowered and we now have new ways to come together via the internet.

Mapping out the flows of information is an important first step to understanding how the organization works and at the same time what possibilities are there for changing those flows of information to change the structure of the system.

**Power Mapping**

"Systems change requires a strong analysis of power and the actors involved – a mapping of power, allies, and opponents. Who’s with you? Who’s against you? Who are your blockers? What are they in it for? Why might these unusual suspects be allies? An analysis of power will not only illuminate what is holding a system in place but can also reveal key levers for transforming power and igniting systems change – often through the most unexpected collaborations."[30]

Systemic change almost always involves changes in power dynamics, it reveals new forms of power and challenges the status quo. In such a case conflict may be a sign of progress, and should be expected.

Power can be defined in many ways, here we will simply define it as the ability to make decisions that will be implemented. The question is who gets to make what decisions and what are the rules of the game.

Nurturing an ecosystem requires a deep awareness of power: Who has it? What kind? Who does not? And we need to understand the power distribution not just in the abstract but in practice. We need to be clear about the context within which we are talking about power. Someone who generally has a lot of power in the system may not have a lot when it comes to a specific issue.

“Power mapping” refers to a set of tools and processes that help us analyze power relationships to develop a strategy for creating change. It helps clarify leverage points and relationships that can influence decision-makers. Likewise it will help us to understand what coalitions building strategies we might need to build.

Power mapping is a visual tool used by social advocates to identify the best individuals to target to promote social change. It reveals available avenues of influence and connections between these influences.[31]

The power mapping process entails the use of a visual tool to conceptualize the sphere of a person or group's influence. Start by listing the different actors and creating categories for them. To fill out a power map we want to create a sticky for each individual or organization that has the influence to make decisions within the system of interest and possibly related systems.

We need to identify the different members and how primary are they to the decision making process. Primary targets, make a direct decision, secondary targets are those who influence the people making decisions.

It is important to remember that within any given system there will be both formal and informal structures of influence and power, the formal dimension is not the only one.

**Incentives Mapping**

Charlie Munger once said, “Show me the incentive and I'll show you the outcome” and this remains as true today as ever. Understanding the structure of incentives in the system is key to understanding how and why it operates the way it does and why it continues in the same path, irrespective of what the stakeholders say.

We need to get an understanding for not just the points of possible collaboration but also the points of competition and where that lie is largely a function of the structure of incentives. incentives can be both positive and negative. Positive incentives are rewarding while negative incentives are punishing. A positive incentive would be like a bonus payment for doing something, while a negative would be for example a fine.

A subtle combination of positive and negative incentives are used by organizations to influence us in different directions. For example, as part of environmental regulation, the government will use a combination of negative incentives such as banning certain polluting activities, but will also use positive incentives such as subsidies for certain activities that are seen to be beneficial to the environment. If we want to change the system we need to be aware of how those incentives are working to either resist change or as potential sources for enabling it.

To dig further into this we can use game theory to gain a more rigorous analysis of the structure of incentives that people find themselves under. Likewise, behavioral science can be used to better understand how people really behave.

Game theory works by seeing the interactions and organizations we form part of as games. A game tries to capture the dynamic where autonomous agents that have their own goals are interdependent in affecting some joint outcomes. A game has three major elements: players, strategies, and payoffs. A player is a decision-maker in a game. A strategy is a specification of a decision for each possible situation in which a player may find themselves. A payoff is a reward or loss that players experience when all the players follow their respective strategies.

Games are played over some mutually desired resources, the resource is whatever is of value to the people in the organization - the agents in the game. A key consideration shaping the overall game dynamic is whether the total value distributed out to all agents remains constant irrespective of their actions or can it grow or decrease depending on their capacity to cooperate.

Constant-sum games are games in which the sum of the players’ payoffs add up to the same number. This makes for games of pure competition, what one gains the other loses. Zero-sum games are a special case of constant-sum games, in which choices by players can neither increase nor decrease the available resources. In zero-sum games, the total benefit to all players in the game, for every combination of strategies, always adds to zero.

One can see this in the game paper, rock, scissors or in most sporting events like basketball. In zero-sum games, the relationship between the agents’ payoffs are negatively correlated, which is called negative interdependence meaning individuals can only achieve their goal via the failure of another agent and this creates an attractor towards competition. These games are called strictly competitive because they are no incentives for cooperation. For example, basketball is a strictly competitive dynamic between the teams because there is no advantage to be gained for either side from cooperation.

Non-constant games or non-zero sum games are those in which the total value to be distributed can increase or decrease depending on the degree of cooperation between actors. For example, through the members of a business working together, they can create more value than working separately, thus the whole payoff gets bigger. Equally, the total payoff may get smaller through conflict, like in an arms race between two gangs in a city.

In non-zero sum games, the outcome for agents is positively correlated, if one gets more the other will too if one gets less than the other will too. With non-zero sum games, we can get positive interdependence between the agents, meaning members of a group come to share common goals and perceive that working together is individually and collectively beneficial, and success depends on the participation of all the members leading to cooperation.

A cooperative game is one in which there can be cooperation between the players and they have the same cost. Thus cooperative games are an example of non-zero sum games. This is because in cooperative games, either every player wins or loses.

Cooperation may be achieved through several different possibilities, it may be built into the dynamics of the game as would be the case with a positive-sum game where payoffs are positively correlated. In such a case the innate structure of the game creates an attractor towards cooperation because it is both in the interest of the individuals and the whole organization.

A good example of this is the mutually beneficial gains from trade in goods and services between nations. If businesses or countries can find terms of trade in which both parties benefit then specialization and trade can lead to an overall improvement in the economic welfare of both countries, with both sides seeing it as in their interest to cooperate in this organization, because of the extra value that is being generated.

Equally, cooperation may be achieved by external enforcement by some authoritative third parties such as governments and contract law. Here we cooperate in a transaction because the third party is ensuring that it is in our interests to do so by creating punishments or rewards. Likewise, cooperation may be achieved through peer-to-peer interaction and feedback mechanisms. For example rating systems on eBay work to ensure that the sellers act in the interest of the buyers because they have the power to leave negative feedback if they don't, which will affect their future sales.

A noncooperative game is one where an element of competition exists and there are limited mechanisms for creating institutions for cooperation. This may be because of the inherent nature of the game we are playing, that is to say, it is a zero-sum game that is strictly competitive and thus cooperation will add no value; as is the case for example with the game chess.

Noncooperation may be a function of isolation, lack of communication and interaction with which to build up the trust that enables cooperation. We see this within modern societies, as these societies have grown in size they have transited from communal cooperative systems based on the frequent interaction of members to requiring formal third parties to ensure cooperation because of the anonymity and lack of interaction between members of large societies. Lastly, there may simply be a lack of formal institutions to support cooperation between members, an example of this might be what we call a failed state where the government’s authority is insufficiently strong to impose sanctions and thus can not work as the supporting institutional framework for cooperation.

Incentive mapping is important because it lets us see the somewhat invisible fields of incentives that are acting on all of us every day. It tells us about the underlying structure of why and where conflict, competition, and cooperation arise and why. It also points us in the direction of possible ways to alter those "games" to realize new outcomes.

**Models and Value Mapping**

Almost 50 years ago Robert Pirsig in his famous book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance had something important to add to our understanding of systems change when he wrote: "If a factory is torn down but the rationality which produced it is left standing, then that rationality will simply produce another factory. If a revolution destroys a government, but the systematic patterns of thought that produced that government are left intact, then those patterns will repeat themselves.”

Mental models and the values that shape them are at the foundations of how we see the world and act upon it to create the environments we inhabit. To get a deep insight into the workings of the system we wish to change we are going to have to map these out; visualize the values and beliefs of the different actors in the system.

Each of us has a different set of ideas, aspirations, and perspectives on how to deal with the world around us. Our mental models contain information accumulated through our lived experiences; they determine our perception of new information and help us create new knowledge. A mental model explains an individual’s reasoning, inferring, and decision-making process that influences their perception.[32]

Mental models reflect the beliefs, values, and assumptions that we hold and they underlie our reasons for doing things the way we do. As Peter Senge’s book, The Fifth Discipline notes mental models are “deeply ingrained assumptions, generalizations, or even pictures of images that influence how we understand the world and how we take action.”

In any organization, there are many individuals with an interest in such systems - the stakeholders - and each will hold a mental model of the system and its purpose depending on their understanding, experience, values, and education.

Interventions into a complex adaptive system should be informed by an understanding of the stakeholder's perspective, we need to be informed by a breadth of available experience, lack of understanding to the different perspectives of the actors in the system can be one of the major stumbling blocks on the road to changing systems.

**Shared Language**

Part of a change initiative will involve building a shared language around the problem, languages express how we see the world, we can't build language without understanding a bit about how people see things. When operating in ecosystems of actors it is important to realize that everyone has their different heritage, their journey to the present and that heritage frames and defines how they understand things and terminology. The same word can mean very different things to two different people because of their backgrounds. Without understanding the context within which a person uses a term, misunderstanding, and conflict will arise. We need to understand where people are coming from before we can learn to speak a common language. Unfortunately, we cannot simply look at other people and discern their mental models we need to make them explicit by of h1. Wikipedia might be an example of this where technology has been used to demonstrate a different mode of production, i.e. peer-production.

**Futuring**
With a group of people, we can then draw the chart up on the wall and ask, what is business as usual? How did we get to that? How fast is the current pattern declining and what aspects of it might we want to see retained? We can likewise look at h3 and ask what is the future we want to bring into reality? What does it look like or feel like to live in that world?

We can ask what in the present leads to that future, and where are the seedlings, what history values and culture are embedded within them? We should be able to give specific examples of this as they should already exist. We can ask how could they be scaled to become more prevalent and give examples of people who are already working on that.

We can also look at the disruptive trends, what are they? we can start to analyze them so as to understand them better, they should be multifaceted, political, environmental, economic, technological. What would it look like for that trend to extend into the business as usual world? What can be done to try and harness it, we can look at examples of both, cases where the trend was usurped by the dominant paradigm and where it is being used to build the new.

**Inertia**
There is a key consideration for our systems change strategy that emerges out of the three horizons model, that is the question of how much do we work with the existing system, introducing innovation that extends it into the new versus building something to disrupt the old. Do we adopt strategies that are symbiotic with the existing system - ones that are designed to take it into the new regime - or do we develop solutions that are largely mutually exclusive with the current regime but likely easier to work with because they have none of the "baggage" of the old?

In this respect, a lot of our system change strategy is relative to the inertia in the system. We are working in between the old and the new pattern, we are trying to continue those patterns in the old that need continuing and connecting them with the new, but at the same time we are trying to discontinue those patterns in the old that need to be discontinued, that discontinuation we could call disruption. Inertia - that takes the form of absolute resistance to some change that needs to take place - needs to be met with this kind of disruption.

Thus the degree to which we work with or disrupt the existing system is relative to its level of inertia which can be seen to represent the degree to which we should work with the new model versus working with the old. Thinking this through is important as it will tell us where to apply our resources, which battles to fight, which aspects of the system we leave to die and which aspects we work with to regenerate. This is never an easy question and an ongoing process of inquiry.

**Subjective Change**

“Never doubt that a small group of committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has.” This quote by the cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead highlights how change starts small with a few individuals and then grows outwards to become a movement. Change does not happen by accident or spontaneously it is led by pioneering.

For sure systems change is about collaboration and the mobilization of whole ecosystems of people and organizations, it is a hugely social endeavor, however, this process starts with an individual or group of individuals separately feeling something is not right and going on a personal journey of questioning and discovery. That journey inevitably means facing challenges along the way as an individual. Initially, each individual has to face the fears of letting go of the past and exploring the unknown future; systems change can not happen without the subjective personal transformation of those who pioneer it.

**Creating the New**
In a metaphorical sense, someone has to pay the bills for the creation of this new world, at the beginning, those are the leaders, the ones who step across the line, create a new space and are prepared to resist the forces that will be inevitably directed at them for challenging and threatening the existing system. Leaders illustrate how, what is, is not the only possible way that things could be, this both inspires people but also threatens the existing regime.

Change requires creating some kind of a vision of a different world; a vision that does not yet exist. This will have to be unique to the system changer, if not there would be no point in starting a new change process, one may as well follow someone else that already has the vision.

To lead this change the person is going to have to create the story of a different world and that starts with the change agent cultivating and growing their own view of the desirable and possible future. Change begins with us, as Geoffrey Betason said: "you can't change the system without changing yourself."

System change is a deeply personal endeavor it is as much about the individual's subjective transformation as it is about the objective transformation of the system itself; they are two sides of the same coin, two dimensions of the same process.

If we are going to lead change we have to see the new, create it in our lives and live it. Doing this requires that we separate ourselves from what is. Separate ourselves from what we have grown up with and has probably supported us for most of our lives, it requires that we as individuals make a journey of separation and rediscovery, this is an inherently personal and subjective journey.

As Otto Scharmer, the creator of Theory U says, this is about finding “a way to break the patterns of the past and tune into our highest future possibility—and to begin to operate from that place.” [39] This is what is required of a systems leader to be the first to see and live the future possibility. As Otto says “Leadership in its essence is the capacity to shift the inner place from which we operate. Once they understand how, leaders can build the capacity of their systems to operate differently and to release themselves from the exterior determination of the outer circle.” [40]

**Values**
Systems change is difficult, but a lot of the difficulty is not out there, it is in one's own subjective journey that begins long before the objective endeavor of changing a system begins. A Lot of the challenge in changing complex organizations is in finding the right motivation and this requires a deep dive exploration into one's values.

Our values are central, we as change agents have to have the right values and act upon them. If you aren't clear about your values and motives your actions will be just as incoherent, and you will dissipate your time and energy going in all directions becoming overloaded. You need to focus on yourself and this focus comes from being clear about what is important and what is not; we come to this conclusion by clarifying our values. This is a process of letting go of those things that are not of value and investing ourselves in those things that are of value.

We are borne into a world that expresses a certain set of values, if we want to change it we are going to have to figure out a better set of values and that means questioning what is of value and what is not, to create a new value system.

The world we create will be an expression of the values that guided our action in creating that world, if we want a different world then we are going to have to question and formulate a different set of values and then act on those with coherence. The success of our actions as change agents depends primarily not on what we do or how we do it but from the inner place from which we operate.

**Motivation**
Our values are important because they define our motives which ultimately defines how far we can go. Systems change is a creative process and a deeply personal one, people don't change systems due to extrinsic motivations, they do it from deep intrinsic motivation. This intrinsic motivation has to be very strong if they are going to sustain the long term endeavors needed to move a complex organization. Changing a complex system can be a lifetime's work and may well require a commitment on the part of the change-makers to outcomes they will never even see in their lifetime. It takes a strong gritty kind of motivation that comes from something intrinsically at the core of the change agent.

Being clear about your motives and continuously working to expand them is the pathway to success. Being unclear about your motives and having a fixed limit is the road to failure. Multiple failings are inevitable, this is why a critical reflection on motives is essential. Temporary failure is good as it is the opportunity to learn, terminal failure - giving up - is not good, the difference between the two is just motives. We fail terminally because we have reached the limits of our motivation. There really is no are aligned correctly because you are always prepared to revisit your motives and redefine the scope of your engagement to overcome the current stumbling blocks that caused you to fail.

The road to success is really about connecting with a context or environment that is of an appropriate scale relative to the problems that you are trying to tackle. When you are connected, inspired and motivated by that broader process and environment then you will be able to overcome the stumbling blocks within it and have the motivation to stay failing and learning until you succeed. Motivation is what gives us the capacity to go back to the beginning and deconstruct our assumptions - values or motives that led us to the point of failure - and then reconstruct them again so as to overcome the stumbling block.

As Forum for the future note in their systems change capabilities "System change is both complex and uncertain, as we are trying to navigate into an unknown future. Underlining the other capabilities is the need for individual change agents to be able to reflect, learn and continually develop their skills and resolve to implement systems change. They need to cultivate personal resilience to deal with the demands of the work and be able to act with integrity and purpose." [41]

**Theory U**

Theory U offers a set of principles and practices for letting go of the past and collectively creating an emerging future. It is a method - for both individuals and organizations - that attempts to sense and bring into the present one's highest future potential.

Theory U takes people through the transformational change needed to develop systems leadership. It is a method that takes people that want to engage in a transformation from "ego-system" to "eco-system" a view that is more embedded in a whole system perspective.

The author of the Theory U concept expresses it as a process or journey, which is also described as Presencing a combination of sensing + presence. It is a method that involves a number of concrete steps along the U diagram. [42]

We move down one side of the U as we attempt to connect with a world that is outside of our existing paradigm, to the bottom of the U, where we connect with the world that emerges from within, and up the other side of the U, where we attempt to bring forth the new into the world. Thus it can be seen as a transformative journey of letting go of the past, opening up and creating the future.

**Openings**

The left-hand side of the U diagram is about letting go of the old way of operating and opening up. In their book Leading from the Emerging Future, Otto Scharmer and Katrin Kaufer describe three “openings” needed to transform systems: Open mind, removing your old habits and looking afresh. Open heart means developing the capacity to look at a problem not just from your angle but from that of the stakeholders. Open will, the capacity to let go and let something new emerge. These three openings match commonly seen blind spots of many change efforts.

**Gate**

At the bottom of the U, lies an inner gate that requires us to drop everything that isn't essential. This process of letting-go, of our old ego and self, and letting-come, our highest future possibility. The essence of presencing is that these two selves - our current self and our best future self - meet at the bottom of the U and begin to listen and resonate with each other.

**Creating**

Once a group crosses this threshold, nothing remains the same. Individual members and the group as a whole begin to operate with a heightened level of energy and a sense of future possibility. They often then start to function as an intentional vehicle for an emerging future.

The right-hand side of the diagram has also three stages, starting with "letting come" people start to explore the values and guidelines they desire for the future? [43]

"Enacting" is a stage for the crystallization of vision and intent, what do the new values and guidelines mean for new functions and roles? How should the organization of the future be visioned?

"Embodying" is about prototyping the new by linking head, heart and hand. How can processes be developed in the future? What phenomena and facts will characterize the organization of the future?

The outcome of this process should be that we can now perform by "operating from the whole" with a renewed and more complete sense of connection to ourselves and why we are doing what we are doing.

At the end of the day Theory U is trying to tap into the deeper sources of excellence - and thus grow our leadership capacities. This has to do with the inner space that we operate from, it is a method that takes us through a process to improve our quality of attention and intention.

**Systems Leadership**

Because of its nature, the kind of leadership needed for systems change is quite different from our traditional conception. We tend to think of leadership as a position at the top of an organization that comes with the authority to make decisions and have those executed upon by others. However, systems change is about leading across boundaries, meaning you will be leading with very little authority.

As Banny Banerjee of Stanford Change Labs puts it "when you are addressing really large-scale challenges, and you really are motivated by the big scale, and you want to make a big difference, then what you need are methodologies that are significantly different from current ones and even innovation methodologies that outperform the current innovation methodologies, but also different mindsets, you need different organizational behavior and above all you need a new kind of leadership and that type of leadership we are calling systems leadership and it is significantly different from business as usual"

Leadership is not a position, it is a modality. Anyone can be a leader by showing leadership qualities. This is particularly true with systems change because the leaders of the new paradigm are unlikely to come from within the traditional positions of authority, as these are the ones who are most invested in the past and thus least likely to be those to see and create the future. In general, leaders are people who see the whole, the changes taking place within that environment and have a sense that they can shape their future and that others can also - they work to enable groups of people to shape their future.

Professor Banerjee goes on to outline the nature of leadership in a system change context by putting it in a chronological contrast to past forms. [44] He posits that the first paradigm of leadership, leadership 1.0, is marked by the ability to execute, as exemplified by the military leader or the role of the chief executive officer. Leadership 2.0 requires understanding humans and experiences to create pull rather than push. Leadership 3.0 is a different game that asks the question, can you change the system itself? Can you create a next-generation system? "The quest for us as systems leaders is simplicity not on this side of complexity but on the other side." [45]

He describes a key capacity of this leader as the ability to create a certain kind of innovation capacity in the system that is currently lacking. It is about enabling others to deal with the scale and complexity of challenges. In this context, the systems leaders' job is to make sure that people are climbing up the ladder when it comes to accepting and dealing with complexity, "learning how to be non-systems blind."

**Wholism**

Otto Scharmer sees leadership as being “about being better able to listen to the whole than anyone else can.” This is a primary ability of a systems leader, the capacity to see the larger system. In any complex setting people typically focus their attention on the parts of the system most visible from their vantage point. This usually results in arguments about who has the right perspective on the problem. Helping people see the larger system is essential to building a shared understanding of complex problems and the job of the systems leader. [46]

They have to not just see the whole but create a space; hold a space. The primary attribute of a true leader is emptiness, which is the condition or space for the creation of something new. Being is like an empty container its primary attribute is that it contains whatever is put inside it. This is why retreats can be of value as a way to detach oneself and create a space of nothingness. At the end of the day, our capacity to achieve emptiness or nothingness will define the scope of our capacity to create systems change. As Otto Scharmer states “what happens at the beginning of any creative process? Nothing! Creativity requires that we create space and wait for something to emerge.”

When a successful leader of the telecom industry was asked what she considered to be the essence of her leadership work. She responded, ‘I am facilitating the opening process so my team can sense and seize emerging opportunities as they arise from the fast-paced business environment we are operating in.’” [47]

Creating space is about living with creative tension. Leaders resolve the contradictions and conflicts that others shy away from and in so doing unblock pathways forward. As Frances Westley notes "there is a long history in the anthropological literature that suggests when you have these kinds of paradoxes and you're able to reconcile them… it actually motivates people to move forward, there's some release of energy." [48]

One example of this would be the person who sees the need to create a new space between different communities, they have to then live with the tension of bridging different communities that may have strongly contradictory views and opinions. Systems leaders need the capacity to not only bridge disconnected groups but to ‘hold’ the shared vision that gathers disparate partners together and fosters community.

**Liminal Space**

An extension of this is the idea that systems change involves liminal spaces. In general liminal spaces are spaces lived in for a certain amount of time as one transitions from a previous state to the next stage? A liminal space is a time between the 'what was' and the 'next.' It is a place of transition, waiting, and not knowing. Liminal space is where transformation happens when we pause and let it shape us into a new form. [49]

In systemschangers.com set of interviews with systems changers, they note "our interviewees describe a ‘split-screen’ perspective – moving in and out of the current system at the same time as creating the conditions for a new system to emerge. Liminal spaces need to be carefully designed to hold unstable groups of people together in the collective pursuit of change." Innovators need to be able to move in and out of the systems they are trying to transform. Even when they are outside of the status quo, they can maintain a dialogue with it.

Likewise to change the system you have to recognize that you are part of it and you are part of the problem. So often our desires to change the system are rendered inert because we separate ourselves from it, putting the problem over there. This is setting the conditions for avoiding systems change, embracing it means embracing our place within the system and our place as part of creating the problem and living with that cognitive dissonance and contradiction within ourselves. We are not the "good guys" the "saviors" we like others are part of the problem and part of working through trying to change the conditions. Real change starts with recognizing that we are part of the systems we seek to change. The failures we seek to remedy also exist within us, as do the fears, distrust, doubt, etc. [50]

Part of living with the tension of liminal space is uncertainty. Systemic leaders are unafraid of the unknown – in fact, they embrace uncertainty. They are able to recognize points of intervention and function successfully in the face of complexity. They combine a will to understand systems with a recognition that they will always have to take action without complete knowledge. [51]

**Responsibility**

Leadership in a systems change context is a lot about responsibility, it is taking on some responsibility of trying to create a better system; stepping across the line and saying a better solution is possible. As Peter Senge notes: "the verb to lead comes from an indo-european root 'lædan' it literally means to step ahead to step across the threshold." [52]

Leaders take responsibility by redirecting attention from seeing that problems “out there” are “in here”. Systems leaders take on responsibility by trying to shift the collective focus from a mode of resistance and reactive problem solving to change to co-creating the future. [53]

Change often starts with undesirable conditions, but creative system leaders help people move beyond just reacting to these problems to building positive visions for the future. This typically happens gradually as leaders help people express their deeper aspirations and build trust based on tangible accomplishments realized together. [54]

Systems change is about changing the structure of a complex organization. This is difficult for a number of reasons, firstly because they are multidimensional but also because they have a deep technical structure that is required for their operations. Likewise, complex adaptive systems will inherently resist large scale change processes. This is for good reason, such a change risks the survival of the system.

To be a system changer is to say a better system can be created and you are going to take on some of the responsibility for doing that. It requires an appreciation for the multiple dimensions of the system, an appreciation for the technical complexity that is required to make the system operate on its different levels. As always it is better to not change a system if you don't understand it or have some appreciation for its technical operations. To lead the change you need to be aware of the system on different levels - technical and nontechnical - and to take some responsibility for making it work on those different levels.

We should only be changing a system if it is systemically dysfunctional and the system itself is not dealing with that core contradiction. There is nothing wrong with a dysfunctional system or one that has contradictions, our world is not perfect, all systems have failures and contradictions, the question is whether they are working to resolve those issues and the system's level of engagement with that.

Part of being responsible in our endeavors to change systems is to accept that the world is not perfect, all systems have failings and those failings will result in inconvenience and suffering for us or others, this is a good reason to try and improve the existing system but it is not a good reason to change the system.

Changing systems is dangerous, risky and hugely demanding on resources, don't do it unless it needs doing. The only valid reason to change a system is if it has deep contradictions that the current regime is not capable or not willing to deal with. Important to note here is that if that is the case then the system is inherently unsustainable and will lead to its own downfall over time.

**Narrative**

Stories shape how we understand the world, our place in it, and our ability to change it, they can make, prop up, and bring down systems. It is through language that we build our shared understanding and culture evolves. It's the narratives that we tell ourselves and the narratives that we tell each other that actually create the world we share. Most of what shapes our lives are institutions, which are largely just stories that we share.

Humans have always used stories to give coherence to the complex world we find ourselves in. With the rise of agrarian societies, we created myths that glorified the land and highlighted the seasonal and daily rhythm of life.[55] When we started to settle, humans created myths imbuing cities and buildings with new values. On a cultural level, the stories we live in justifying the status quo, make institutions feel inevitable, legitimize certain kinds of solutions, and make our world feel preordained, when in fact it is largely the story that adds these attributes.

Our future is made up of the stories we tell today, thus we can change our future by simply telling different stories. If we want to change a system, create a different world, we are going to have to have a coherent story about the new possibilities. As such the output to a vision should be a story that is both aspirational and realistic, which will engage and ignite change.

Charlotte Millar co-founder and strategist with the Finance Innovation Lab talks about the need for stories as part of a system change process as such: “this work of authoring a compelling story about yourself, your community, and the need for urgent action, is integral to creating movements. Without a common story, movements lack a narrative about why they exist and will fail to generate a sense of belonging amongst their members.”

**Elements of Stories**

For people to act with sustained coherence they need some culture that makes sense of their world and gives it coherence - an ontology - they need some value system to tell them which way is up and which way is down - an axiology - these values create a direction for them to travel in to get to the things they value - a teleology.

In the article Using Story to Change Systems Ella Saltmarshe itemizes some of the key attributes to stories - "Story has many different qualities that make it useful for the work of systems change. It’s a direct route to our emotions, and therefore important to decision-making. It creates meaning out of patterns. It coheres to communities. It engenders empathy across difference. It enables the possibility to feel probable in ways our rational minds can’t comprehend. When it comes to changing the values, mindsets, rules, and goals of a system, the story is foundational."

**Sense-Making**

Sense-making is the process by which people give meaning to their collective experiences. It has been defined as "the ongoing retrospective development of plausible images that rationalize what people are doing."[56]

In the 21st century with the rise of the Anthropocene we live in uncharted territory, where old stories that served us well for so long are now appearing incomplete in a world of complexity. We increasingly feel a sense of being overwhelmed and the world "falling apart" because our stories of how the world works are no longer suffice and that lack of story translates into a lack of direction. In this uncharted territory, we are looking for new ways to make sense of complexity.

The formation of stories or narratives helps us make sense of the world around us within a coherent overall narrative. They relax the constraints of itemizing details and strict adherence to facts so that we can try to see and make sense of the whole.

Stories help us make sense of our world the past, present, and future, thus illuminating the ways of change. They can, in a comprehensive way, illustrate future possibilities and gaps with present reality to create the space for creative tension and energy.

As systems practitioner David Stroh said in an interview: “It’s like the story of the blind men and the elephant. Everyone only sees their part of an elephant. They see the individual stories they tell themselves about what’s true. Sharing these helps them create a more expanded and accurate collective narrative. It enables them to develop a shared picture of reality.”

**Identity**

Building a new identity for a network of members is required to engage people in change. Identities can be created, and have always been created, with not much more than a story. France, Japan, the United States are stories that were created when a group of people started to connect due to innovations in communication, transport, political organization, and cultural change. Identities are created when there is a fertile ground of connectivity and shared experience, it is the story that builds upon that to give it coherence. This is illustrated by Jean Monnet's statement back at the foundation of the European Union "Europe has never existed. One must genuinely create Europe."[57]

People are now connected in new ways and share experiences across old divides. The global middle class is but one such group and new stories are now needed to help them see their shared identity; to mobilize these groups in new ways to meet the challenges of today. As Peter Senge notes: "organizations, it doesn’t matter how much money they make, it doesn’t matter how much power and technology they have, they don’t last that long, but there is a relatively small number that has lasted a very long time, and they found the first defining feature of long-lived companies was a sense of identity. They had a sense of who they were that transcended what they did. Therefore because they were secure in this core identity they were more open and adaptive."

Systems change is about connecting across boundaries and between organizations and individuals who would normally not recognize a commonality or shared intent. To create a space that brings those people together we are going to have to create a new story and identity that all feel a part of; to create empathy, coherence and enable people to connect across differences.[58]

The empathetic aspect of story is vital here, when bringing together groups, we need to compose a picture of the world and the issues at hand, the possible solution that involves the relevant parties illustrating how they need to be working together to get the desired outcomes. Stories create the context within which very different people can discover their shared values and connect. As such we have to be very careful in the creation of our narrative to ensure that it does not exclude those that need to be a part of the change process.

Narrative in its different forms can help to hold a mirror up to a group of people so that they see themselves and understand their commonalities better. Otto Scharmer notes the importance of this when he says: “The one thing that I have learned from all these projects is that the key to transformative change is to make the system see itself. That’s why deep data matters. It matters to the future of our institutions, our societies, and our planet.”[59]

**Stories Are Intangible**

Stories use abstraction to remove the details and thus better reveals some overall pattern over time. In this way they can cover a lot of ground, working to connect people with their past, they can be used to dramatize the present situation and the need for change, to create momentum and drive.

One of the major benefits to this abstract nature to stories is that they are largely intangible and can thus be almost costless, and an incredibly powerful way to scale at near-zero cost. A story that at its core is simple but engenders a creative and powerful idea can immediately engage people and ignite them towards change.

In this respect, Graham Leicester of International Futures Forum notes: "What we see is it takes a shift in mindset to start a transformative innovation, minimal finance. If you put up a big innovation budget and invite applications you are not likely to get something transformative. It doesn't really take money to get started it takes a shift in mindset."

Today in the era of global media and telecommunications storytelling is as powerful a vehicle as ever, films, television shows, online videos and advertisements move people and engage people like little else. With digital technologies and a global telecommunication infrastructure, the tools we now have at our fingertips for telling stories and communicating a message to possibly billions is quite profound and should be seen as one of our greatest resources and potential to change systems.

**Section 4: Strategy**

Given the scale of the systems we are trying to influence and our lack of resources relative to this, systems change has to be highly strategic in nature. However, we have to redefine what we mean by the term "strategy" when dealing with complex organizations as here again our old logic of change will fail and lead us down the wrong path.

With systems thinking we are shifting our perception of the system from parts to the network of relations that interconnect them into the whole, in this context, strategy becomes about influencing this pattern of connections.

In complex systems linear causality does not work so well, attempt to directly alter specific parts and outcomes leads to unintended consequences because they do not take account of the complex set of relationships and feedback loops that are affected by those interventions.

As such with systems change we do not aim to directly change the parts but instead try to alter the connections, which alters the flow of resources, information and ideas. This works to create a new context within which the parts interact and thus over time influence their operations and the operations of the whole.

A key idea in changing systems is obliquity, that we take an indirect approach to influencing the system; an oblique strategy that aims to enable rather than to create change. The idea is that small, smart, low profile interventions actually provide other players in the system with information and the opportunity to self-organize in new ways and this over time creates much wider and indirect systemic impacts.

The strategy of the systems changer should be about making artful small interventions - based upon our systems map - that work to connect or disconnect links within the system, to dampen down or amplify certain aspects. This strategy should be working synergistically with our storytelling, which worked to shine a light on some aspects while not others.

At the same time, we are always working with the system's' innate propensity for change, not against it. The system is always changing and any change process involves both directions of constructive and destructive change, we are trying to make the connections that will allow resources to flow to the new system we are trying to see emerge. We do this by changing the flow of resources, information and ideas, finding the missing links and connecting them, the missing information flows, redirecting value flows, etc.

**Leverage Points**

The system we are trying to change will have vastly more resources with which to resist our change than we can ever muster so we need to know what battles to fight; we have to choose specific points in the system where we will influence and lead that will have the greatest influence.

When you stand outside the system observing it we can at least try to see the whole but when we go to make interventions we have to choose specific points in the system to intervene.

There are countless places within a complex system to place yourself where what you will do will have almost zero effect, worse than this the points that look like they have the highest impact initially are often those with the lowest.

The manifest positions of power in the system, such as the position at the top of a hierarchy, appear to have power and influence because of linear cause and effect, however, such linear effects have little overall systems change capacity.

We need to place ourselves in the system and influence it at points where the least effort and resources will create the largest long term influence. These points are called leverage points. It is firstly important to know that leverage points are counter-intuitive. Leverage is not found in the centralized points of the greatest manifest power in the system but is found rather in abstraction.

The leverage points, first published in 1997 by Donnella Meadows, who worked in the field of systems analysis, proposed a scale of places to intervene in a system. She started with the insight that there are levers or places within a complex system where a "small shift in one thing can produce big changes in everything." Donella meadows listed 12 of these, they follow an ordering of increased abstraction and increased effectiveness, from the lowest to highest they are listed as such.[60]

12. Constants, parameters, numbers - such as products sold, number of employees, etc.
11. The sizes of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their flows.
10. The structure of material stocks and flows - such as transport networks, population age structures.
9. The length of delays, relative to the rate of system change.
8. The strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the impacts they are trying to correct against.
7. The gain around driving positive feedback loops.
6. The structure of information flows - who does and does not have access to information.
5. The rules of the system - such as incentives, punishments, constraints.
4. The power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure.
3. The goals of the system.
2. The mindset or paradigm out of which the system - its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters - arises.
1. The power to transcend paradigms.

**Iceberg model**

The iceberg model is another way of expressing these levels of abstraction that one needs to understand and use to intervene on the right level and at the right places. The iceberg model was developed by anthropologist Edward T. Hall in the 1970s, it tries to illustrate the various levels of abstraction to a situation or organization, from the observable events to underlying patterns that generate these, to the supporting structure and ultimately the mental models used by an organization.

An iceberg is used as an analogy to represent the underlying structures generating perceived events and issues, as it is known to have only 10 percent of its total mass above the water while 90 percent of it is underwater. The phrase “tip of the iceberg” connotes that what one can see is only a small part of a whole situation, i.e. there is much more below the surface and what it looks like maybe surprising.

The Iceberg Model typically identifies four basic levels of situations. Events, which represent the manifest components and actions observable to us. The patterns of behavior beneath this describe trends over time. System structure describes how the parts are interrelated to influence the patterns. Finally, the mental models that support everything else in the system through a set of beliefs, values, and assumptions shaping people’s perception.[61]

**Events & Reaction:** If we only look at events, the best we can do is react. Something happens, and we fix it. This is typically our response the first time an event occurs. We do not shift our thinking in any way; we just act swiftly to fix the immediate problem using pre-existing solutions that have worked in the past. For some superficial circumstances, this approach can work well, but will fail if an issue is more systemic as we are merely dealing with the symptoms of the problem.

**Pattern & Anticipation:** When we start to notice a pattern of those events, we have more options. We can anticipate what is going to happen, and we can prepare for it. When we start noticing patterns, we can begin to consider what is allowing the same events to happen over and over again.

**Structure & Design:** When we start to look at the underlying structures, we begin to see where we can change what is happening. We are no longer at the mercy of the system. We can begin to identify the thinking and the mental models that are resulting in those structures taking the form they do.

**Mental Model & Transform:** Changing the model that an organization uses is the highest leverage point, it can lead to real transformation, with the possibility to restructure the system and overcome even the greatest of challenges.

**Change in Quality**

Systems change is about changing underlying structures, it is a qualitative change. The high leverage points are really in the qualitative factors of the system, they are the things that are not being measured or accounted for and thus they go largely unnoticed. However, transformations are phase transitions that are known to be qualitative changes in a system structure.

A reductionist analytical approach has led our cultures to place an overemphasis on quantity and numbers, it gives us the sense that what we can measure is more important than what we can not measure. In a systems normal state of operations, it may well be that quantity matters most - because it is in a linear negative feedback regime - but it is quality that creates transformation, nonlinear change is a qualitative change. If we look at the leverage points we will see that those with higher systems changing potential - ie farther down the list - are qualitative in nature.

**Multi Level Perspective**

As mentioned in a previous module to get a comprehensive understanding of a system we have to look at it on different levels; the processes of change taking place on those different levels and how structures inter-relate on those different scales.

One model for helping us to think about how change happens on these different levels is the multi-level perspective(MLP) a prominent framework for describing transition processes in complex socio-technical systems. This is also a theory of change as it tries to describe how innovations can combine with macro-level change to disrupt the existing regime.[62]

The MLP posits three levels on which processes interact and align to result in socio-technical system transformation; the macro-level called the landscape, the meso-level called the regime and micro-level called the niche.

**Landscape**

The landscape-level represents the overall environment within which the system exists. The Landscape forms the ‘external structure or context for interactions of actors.’[63] For example, the natural environment, the demographics of a society, the "technosphere", the socio-political trends, as well as the cultural values. For example, the industrial age forms an overall technological context, likewise, the Anthropocene forms an overall socio-ecological context. From a systems theory perspective, the landscape is simply the environment within which the system operates where macro-processes of change play out that typically change over long periods of time.

**Regime**

The regimes are persistent configurations of markets, infrastructures, technology, policy and so on that have settled into stable configurations. They are the shared rules within a set community and describe the current pattern or structure of the status quo that typically develops incrementally. The socio-technical regime is dynamically stable in the sense that innovation still happens, though incrementally, and along a predictable trajectory.[64] From a systems theory perspective, the regime would represent the overall structure of the system within which elements find themselves, the way they are interrelated, the existing pattern to the flow of resources, the rules, policies, and protocols that structure this.

**Niche**

The "niche" represents the home of innovations, new models, communities, or local networks on the micro-level. The niche is defined as the “locus for radical innovations” where dedicated actors nurture the development of technological novelties.[65] The niche fosters and incubates innovations that differ fundamentally from the prevailing regime and usually require landscape developments that open windows of opportunity at the regime level.[66] From a systems theory perspective these may be seen as the emerging new elements.

**Change Process**

In the original account by Geels, the stability of existing socio-technical systems results through interaction between the physical dimension of the system, the rules, and regimes that guide perceptions and actions, the organizations and actor-network. The path dependence which locks in existing patterns is seen to occur at the meso-level. In general, the MLP model attributes socio-technical transitions to the interaction of stabilizing forces at the regime level with destabilizing forces from both the landscape and niche levels.[67]

Transitions are seen to commence when: a prevailing socio-technical regime starts to display stress for multiple dimensions; a key innovation occurs that will become a dominant design, and early adoption of the new technology starts.

**Example**

An often given illustration of the MLP in action is in the analysis of the usage of personal transport, e.g. the car. A key idea of MLP is that a technology like a car, comes to prominence through its interdependencies and co-evolution with social-technical and institutional factors, including the advent of mass production, the development of roads and other infrastructure, regulation and culture creating a system called a socio-technological regime that supports and sustains that particular innovation.

Over time these interdependencies in this pattern lock society into a particular regime. As a technology like a car matures people working in the industry - the car designers, research managers, engineers and so forth - tend to develop common assumptions knowledge beliefs and habits about what is possible and legitimate as a transport solution.

This pattern will then work to resist change and throw up barriers to innovations that challenge it. Economies of scale initially protect the incumbents and a 
network of third parties that have formed around it will reinforce its workings, with little incentive to support new alternatives. Lifestyles and attitudes co-evolved with the evolution of the car as the dominant means of transport, reinforced by the media and popular culture as signs of individual freedom and success, as well as public policies such as taxation and regulation which the car evolved with often create an uneven playing field for other potential solutions. Now innovations have to compete not just with the car, but with this whole system of social, physical and institutional factors that have co-evolved with the car and this tends to lock society into a particular trajectory even when it has become suboptimal.

**Disruption**

So how can change happen if the system is so locked into a particular solution? First, the current system has to be disrupted in some way from the landscape level, a change in the environment. This may include change in society's dominant values and beliefs, a major event such as natural disasters, or concerns over climate change in the example of the car. These landscape disruptions create windows of opportunity for new and radical innovations to gain market share, for example, the electric car. [68]

Even if niche-innovations have a competitive relationship with the existing regime and a window of opportunity is available, the niche level will not always be able to avail of this opportunity created by weaknesses in the regime to introduce a new socio-technical paradigm.

The elements of the niche level need to be mature enough, become aligned and stabilize in a dominant design. Even if there is pressure on the regime to change coming from the sociotechnical landscape, if niche-innovations are not mature and structured sufficiently, dominant actors may respond by modifying the direction of development paths and their innovation activities without transforming the incumbent regime. [69]

For example, electric or public transport may be subsumed into the existing regime as a means of reducing the landscape pressure for example hybrid cars. This later adoption, however, might over time push the incumbent regime trajectory in a new direction for example further stimulating electric vehicle development. MLP illustrates that it's not just market prices or R&D or subsidies which stimulate radical innovations but that an interdependent network of physical, social and institutional factors shape innovation and sustainability transitions.

As shown in the MLP model transitions occur at multiple levels, through the interplay of processes at different levels and networks. When we develop a better understanding of how social and technological change occurs we can stimulate new ideas to create systems change through leveraging the change on different levels. [70]

**Systems Aikido**

As discussed in previous modules, systems change themselves and it is our job to work with that change rather than against it. This strategy is akin to the philosophy of aikido. Aikido is a modern Japanese martial art, it is a way of defense or non-resistance, where we are learning not how to fight, but how to not fight; we are trying to make use of the opponent's energy and directing them in a particular direction.

Alex Penn of the University of Surrey adapted this philosophy to create "systems aikido" which is an approach to systems change based upon the principles of aikido. She recognizes that most of our current approaches involve putting lots of energy into changing systems against their innate drive. A classic example being intensive monoculture "in which every year we're plowing, we're digging, we're putting in fertilizers herbicides pesticides, huge amounts of energy to make this system run… we're putting in energy to constantly bring the system back, to hold the system... we're constantly pushing a rock up a hill only to have it roll back down again." [71]

She equates this approach to that of karate "in karate you put a lot of energy into forcing your opponent to do something." She goes on to contrast this approach with that of aikido "in aikido, you intervene when your opponent comes at you, and tip them using their own momentum so that they fall. You're using very little energy, but it takes a lot more understanding in order to intervene effectively." [72]

Systems aikido can be seen as similar to the agricultural approach of permaculture. Bill Mollison the "father of permaculture" described it as "a philosophy of working with, rather than against nature; of protracted and thoughtful observation rather than protracted and thoughtless labor; and of looking at plants and animals in all their functions, rather than treating any area as a single product system." With the aikido approach, we would have to put in less work to sustain the system, because that is where the system is going anyway.

When you watch aikidoists practicing you don’t see a typical adversarial battle between aggressor and defender. It appears more like a dance than combat, more like a physical exchange between two people giving and receiving energy. [73] In life, the aikido metaphor is realized when you transform challenges into opportunities and adapt to new circumstances with ease, "going with the flow" instead of struggling against it. You are practicing aikido whenever you listen with interest to an opposing view or search for mutual understanding.

**Motives**

It may be of value to note that the origins of these two approaches lie with our subjective motives to change the system in the first place. A motive to change the system simply because we don't like the current state of it will inevitably lead to us specifying a desired state and putting a lot of energy into realizing that state that suits us better. In contrast, when we are trying to enable the system to develop in a productive direction this opens us to a different approach that works with its innate development rather than against it.

If your initial motive is to change the system because you don't like it those motives will constrain your possible set of actions and you will not be successful. A valid reason to undertake systems change is if the system does not work. If a system does not work it will create negative externalities, those negative externalities will accumulate over time rendering the system unsustainable. It is important to be aware of this dynamic because it should be a central part of our strategy to change the system.

It is the very thing that we object to about the system - the negative externalities - that will lead to its downfall and it is this core dynamic and pattern that we should be working with. It is only when a system becomes destabilized that we will get the chance to have a large scale impact on it through agile interventions. In its normal operating state and environment, the system will have many strong negative feedback loops that will resist our influence, it is only when the environment changes and it becomes destabilized that there is enough positive feedback for our small interventions to work with that positive feedback and drive the system into a new state.

As Alex Penn notes "When you have lots of oil or coal or chemicals, as we have done since the Industrial Revolution, you'll have the energy and resources to keep karate-chopping your systems into submission. But when fuel becomes scarce or expensive, or we want to reduce CO2 emissions and pollution, the Systems Aikido philosophy comes into its own."

Trying to change a system when it is in a strong negative feedback regime is like doing Karate, we have to wait and look for where the destabilizing positive feedback is and then work with that - to do systems aikido.

**Social Acupuncture**

Benjamin Kumpf, Head Of Innovation at DFID, highlights well the nature of realizing change in complex systems where linear cause and effect interventions are limited in capacities: "There is no linear solution for a complex problem in a system, rather with partners you identify what are blockages and bottlenecks in the system - including the political ones - and where can you intervene to do something about them."

Professor of strategy and complexity at Regent University Orit Gal builds upon this when she describes the essence of systems change through strategic interventions: "The manner in which money, information, behavior, skills, ideas flow through a certain network will ultimately determine its overall well-being. When we recognize really successful Ecologies, that could be a peaceful community, a successful education system, or just a great city vibe, what we actually recognize is a certain pattern it's a kind of just-right Goldilocks mix of structures and flows and while these channels can't be engineered they can be actively promoted." [74]

Systems acupuncture draws insight from the ancient practice of acupuncture to provide a strategy for systems change. In general, acupuncture is an age-old healing practice of traditional Chinese medicine in which thin needles are placed at specific points in the body. Acupuncture seeks to release the flow of the body's vital energy or "chi" by stimulating multiple points along energy pathways, as such it sees the bodily system's health as a network of flows and aims to intervene at certain points to release blockages, the ultimate aim is to help the system flow back into balance.

But how does this work in the context of systems change? Orit Gal talks about systems acupuncture as working by analyzing existing flows across a certain ecology, we then design actions that make small accumulative interventions usually away from the core to strengthen or disrupt a given pattern. The idea behind it is that over time the dominant paradigm we aim to disrupt will be gradually undermined and subverted so that the system will gain the needed momentum to tip into a new basin of attraction, a new equilibrium state of behavior. The system is not directly restructured but is simply nudged to evolve in different directions. The role of intervention is not to physically shift or push the system it is simply to add information into the network, to alter routing logic. This is about signaling to the network how to reconfigure dysfunctional relations and flows.

This approach analyzes dynamic flows rather than specific conditions, it then design sets of low-intensity interventions whose sole aim is to strengthen or disrupt these very patterns. The interventions themselves, in this case very thin needles, do not insert new resources into the environment, they do not even take control over any key functions, they simply temporarily provide the system with information to reorganize itself. In this sense when you think about what is a healthy system or an overall state of well-being it is defined more in terms of resilience, which is really an organism's ability to respond to emerging challenges rather than a specific stable state of equilibrium.

Orit Gal gives the example of "Joe" who led a foundation promoting environmental issues in Europe. Most European environmental policies are decided in Brussels and what she noticed was the high barriers to entry into the decision-making networks there. So instead of focusing expensive resources on traditional political lobbies, she instead helped the social enterprise that provides ethical offices set up their first base in Brussels. Suddenly loads of small NGOs who previously could not interact with the bureaucratic network had a base to operate from and a whole swarm of environmentalists were now unleashed on the town and this of course over time altered information, social and political exchanges. [75]

The objective for intervention is two-fold, it can be aimed at either disrupting or enhancing existing flows identified across the system's network, to divert them into new and hopefully more productive configurations. The rationale of systems acupuncture is that effective interventions can better be instigated upstream, where physical resistance is least, potential propensities are at their foremost, and where the impact could resonate throughout the system via indirect effects. This approach is reflective of the idea of the butterfly effect and "sensitivity to initial conditions" where small changes in initial conditions can create highly divergent outcomes in the long run.

Many of today’s most complex challenges can be better thought of as the emergent outcomes of a complex adaptive system, patterns that are continuously recreated through the ongoing decisions, behaviors, and interactions among numerous players operating across thick global networks. Instead of our traditional linear approaches that are constantly pushing against complexity, systems acupuncture reveals an approach that harnesses and utilizes complexity to our advantage. [76]

**Systems Gardening**

Complexity science informs us that we cannot hope to know a priori what a complex adaptive system will do or know specifically how to achieve optimal outcomes never mind control. A design cannot be completed on paper and executed in an orderly and predictable fashion, past attempts to do this have rarely succeeded, as such a new understanding of "management" is required. This alternative complexity inspired approach is more akin to the job of the gardener rather than the manager of today.

Paul Plsek in his paper Redesigning Health Care with Insights from the Science of Complex Adaptive Systems outlines the nature of systems gardening well when he writes: "[when dealing with complex adaptive systems] it is more helpful to think like a farmer than an engineer or architect... Engineers and architects need to design every detail of a system. This approach is possible because the responses of the component parts are mechanical and, therefore, predictable. In contrast, the farmer knows that he or she can do only so much. The farmer uses knowledge and evidence from past experience and desires an optimum crop. However, in the end, the farmer simply creates the conditions under which a good crop is possible. The outcome is an emergent property of the natural system and cannot be predicted in detail."

The differences between mechanical and naturally adaptive systems are clear when looked at with consideration. We typically design and manage complex organizations as if the parts and interconnections were predictable in their behavior, although fundamentally, they are not, unfortunately this is often overlooked. When the individuals do not act as predicted, we say that people are being “irrational” or “resistant to change.” Often we proceed by specifying behavior in even more detail with added rules. The implicit assumption seems to be that we should be aiming to make people act more like machines so that change can be engineered in the desirable fashion. [77]

**Context**

Systems thinking is about looking at the context within which things exist when we translate this through to systems change we can see it as a strategy that aims to create environments or contexts that are conducive to the emergence of the new.

The management of complex systems uses oblique methods for altering a system via its environment or context to create the conditions for new, properties, elements and phenomena to emerge. As John Kania notes "we're thinking about systems change not as an issue or a person that needs to be fixed… it's the set of conditions that surround that individual. We need to work on shifting the conditions that hold the problem in place." [78]

David Snowden illustrates the systems gardener approach well with his allegory of the children's party where he talks about how to organize a children's party based upon the principles of complexity theory/systems change.

We start by drawing a line in the sand that is a boundary or limit informing the children they are free within that boundary condition. One of the things you learn pretty fast as an adult is the value of flexible negotiable boundaries because rigid boundaries have a habit of becoming brittle and breaking catastrophically.

We then introduce probes, safe to fail experiments, a football video, a barbecue, a computer game, we wait to see if a patent forms. If it does we call this an attractor, if it is beneficial other kids will get attracted to it, they will start to play. At this point, if it is productive we do not take resources away or we, in fact, give it resources, if it is negative this is where we need the fire hoses. David Snowden summarizes this approach when he says "we manage the emergence of beneficial coherence within attractors, within boundaries and that allows locally valid solutions to emerge." [79]

He goes on to highlight the fact that in complex adaptive systems we can not just transpose a solution that worked in one place to another, each context is unique. This is why we need to look at and operate on the pattern level and not deal with the specific details. As he says "you've got to have that ability to actually see patterns and respond to positive or negative patterns, different things will work at different times." This is the general nature of complex systems they are always conditioned by their context or environment, meaning they change from one context to the next.

Snowden's take away point is "dispositional, not causal, that's the basic lesson of complex adaptive systems, you haven't got a system with linear cause, you can't say if I do this then that will happen, you can say at the moment the system is disposed to evolve like this and it's not disposed to evolve like that, the minute you break that causal link everything becomes easier."

**Pockets of the Future**

One approach to changing the paradigm is to first outline generally the attributes and qualities of the new paradigm and then look in the present for seeds that embody the values and qualities that may enable them to grow into creating that future. As William Gibson remarked, “the future is already here, it’s just not very evenly distributed.” We can use the "pockets of the future" that exist in the present as a way to tangibly demonstrate the new possibilities and help to give the new paradigm a sense of being realizable.

These pockets of the future can be defined as "an observable practice, idea, or thing that is rare and insignificant in the present moment but has the potential to become more prevalent and impactful. Pockets of the futures are important weak signals that have the potential to profoundly influence the organization’s core challenge." [80]

These pockets of the future are important to our strategy in that they give something observable, demonstrable that people can go and examine, to see the expression of a different way of thinking or a different set of values. Our strategy here as systems gardeners is to simply shine a light on the new and demonstrate the viability of the theory or paradigm in practice.

The systems gardener seeds transitions by identifying, connecting, supporting and spotlighting pioneers of the new system, by watering the seeds of new ideas and enabling change through emergence. This "emergence" happens when separate local efforts are connected to form communities of practice and once this happens systems-level change can actually be catalyzed. The connector creates connections and learning cycles between the different systems levels and geographic locations.

Change starts with a small group of people who form what we might call a "creative integrity" who are willing to stand for something, maintain commitment and energy over the time that it grows. Our systems gardening strategy is to find these niches and "nourish" them with the resources they need. Like looking after plants you might have to give them water to grow, but you may also have to alter the broader context they exist in so that they get enough light or are not crowded out by other plants, maybe they have to be put in contact with other creatures to create synergies.

As an example, we can look at the NGO Ashoka. Ashoka identify and support social entrepreneurs who have found an idea that is systems-changing. They not only work with these entrepreneurs by providing them with mentorship and resources but also by trying to remove the blockages to their development, for example, regulation or government policy that may be hindering their progress.

The key take away from this module is that a systems state is really an ecological state, it can not be designed at will, it can only be nourished, and this nourishing is the job of the systems gardener.

**Systems Entrepreneur**

"What is the most powerful force you can bring to bear? It is in a really big idea, but only if it is in the hands of a really good entrepreneur, it is that combination that changes the world"- Bill Drayton Ashoka

With a growing awareness that neither the public sector nor the traditional private enterprise are designed for delivering systems-level innovation has come a new approach, something of a hybrid, this new strategy seeks to use market methods to realize systems change, we call these change agents "systems entrepreneurs."

A systems entrepreneur is a person or organization that works to enable a change to an entire ecosystem by addressing and incorporating all the elements and actors required to move the needle on a particular social, economic, technological or environmental issue.

Systems entrepreneurs bring together relevant stakeholders to share their resources, knowledge, understanding, and capabilities with each other in pursuit of a common goal. In their pursuit of influencing a system they must play multiple roles, they are networkers, facilitators, innovators, and business developers. These are the actors that have to bring things together and create momentum among the other actors. [81] Systems entrepreneurs want to change the entire ecosystem and they must navigate the delicate balance of working with and through others to achieve this.

**Strategy**

A business model is the strategy of the systems innovator. They aim to influence the system and proceed by creating a platform that organizes people and resources in a productive way to deliver value and in so doing make it possible for them to capture the required revenue to support their initiative and grow. This makes them somewhat independent relative to other organizations that are dependent upon funding from others, such as charities, NGOs or even the public sector. This strategy taps into the possibilities of the market actors to stay growing and delivering their service to more people as long as it is delivering value to them and able to gain sufficient revenue to fund themselves.

**Example**

Geneva Global gives an example of their work as systems entrepreneurs when they worked to reduce the incidence of human trafficking across the India-Nepal border on behalf of a client. [82]

They started by bringing potential implementing partners together for an in-country conference to get their collective wisdom and understanding of the system. Here they facilitated 28 different organizations working together in a coordinated, comprehensive approach that tackled the issue along various dimensions.

"Some were focused on preventing Nepalese and Indian men, women, and children from getting snared into trafficking. Others conducted rescue and rehabilitation interventions, while other organizations worked with transport police, magistrates, and the legal systems in both countries to provide more protection for vulnerable people exploited by organized criminal networks."

By supporting these different organizations to see how they were part of the larger system, increased cooperation and better coordination from those involved was realized.

This group of actors became so intergrated that they created their own formal network and started a joint advocacy initiative against human trafficking, aimed at getting policy change from the governments of the Bihar and Utter Pradesh state. In so doing they managed to realize changes from the top-down that would reinforce the work being done at the local level. By facilitating and coordinating the relevant stakeholders to apply bottom-up and top-down influence, they were able to effectively improve a social issue on the systems level. [83]

**Systems Investing**

Talk of entrepreneurship inevitably leads to a question surrounding systems-level investment strategies; what it takes to move from venture investment to system investment. In general, venture investing is about narrowing down to a small set of high growth ventures. In contrast, systems change investing is about widening the field of collaborators from different parts of the system to amplify change.

The effects produced when the traditional venture investment approach is applied are those of “elimination” produced by selection. It ultimately creates a competitive landscape, where prioritization and individual case value result in a reduction in the initial state of complexity, similar to weeding a garden so that we keep only those plants that will be of high value to us. [84]

As the authors of the paper Funnelling Vs Layering note "In the end, the effect of a funneling interaction is a significant reduction of complexity and the determination of a simple object for action and commitment of resources." [85] The problem is that the “business case” rationale is only valid at the level of the individual instance, there is no measurement for the value delivered to the system and often the same goes vice versa; the negative externalities are not accounted for.

Systems change investing is about widening the field of collaborators from different parts of the system to amplify change. We invert the funnel so it amplifies outwards. We start with a small core organized around a common challenge with a shared vision of the future and then we try to widen the field of collaborators involved in developing new ideas, policies, businesses, and social movements.

**Funding**

We are certainly still on a journey when it comes to trying to transition from venture investment to system investment. However, we can say one thing for sure, it takes more than money to solve big issues. Indeed many elements are more important than money, effective collaborations, hope or imagination, which are often in shorter supply but far more important to success. [86]

We should not forget that with systems change we are changing patterns, not "things" as such it should not require a large amount of resources or capital. In fact, counter to our traditional thinking, it could be argued the fewer resources the better.

As Orit Gal puts it "acupuncture needles are inexpensive and in abundance, we simply need to change the way we analyze systems the way we define our goals and the way we design our actions to make best use of them."

When we have the resources we are inclined to use them to change the system. A corporation with millions of dollars to invest in innovation will inevitably create a flashy innovation lab and hire people with all sorts of PhDs paying them lots of money. The problem with this is that systems change requires high levels of intrinsic motivation - and at the inception probably only a few people - while extrinsic motivators are often counterproductive to this. As the New Scientist article of 9th April 2011 notes "The facts are absolutely clear. There is no question that in virtually all circumstances in which people are doing things in order to get rewards, extrinsic tangible rewards undermine intrinsic motivation."

**Pitching**

Another cornerstone of many social innovation and entrepreneurship programs is a social venture business plan competition. Many of these competitions, like most traditional business plan competitions, invite entrepreneurs to pitch in front of an audience of judges, and sometimes offer grants or social investment funding as a prize.

As Daniela Papi-Thornton in her talk "From Social Entrepreneurs to Systems Change Leaders" notes many of these competitions provide training on business model development and pitching but are not often designed around a systems orientation, nor do these competitions often provide systems tools and training. [87]

Many times questions asked in applications for these competitions are similar to those asked in traditional business plan competitions such as “Who are your competitors and how is your offering unique?” This is an extension of the traditional entrepreneurial model that is focused on competition to "win" while system change is about the system "winning" which requires different vetting processes.

As Daniela remarks a more appropriate model for funding applications would be to ask questions like: “How is your offering building upon the successes and failures of other efforts working on the same issue, and how will your work improve the impact potential of other elements in the system?” Ideally, these competitions should be asking applicants to describe or map the systems in which they work and illustrate how their offering contributes to shifting or improving the system by contributing to the impact of the collective? [88]

Organizations which recognize that systems change is about building synergies rather than silver bullets are redesigning their business plan competitions to incentivize systems understanding before solution pitching.

**Section 5: Develop**

One could easily argue that there is no such thing as a "solution" when it comes to wicked problems, many of them are open-ended. Inequality, financial crisis, the challenges of providing homes and health care will always be with us. What can change though is our capacity to respond to those challenges, what can change is the resilience or "health" of our systems and their capacity to work together towards responding to complex challenges. Rather than "solving" problems, the job of system change is to change the structure of systems so that they are better set up to respond to those challenges.

We are moving from a world where one organization could drive changes to a world where that is no longer possible because of the complexity; shifting the paradigm starts with the organization recognizing this. This is about building the awareness of the system of itself and the collaborations between different domains that allow for the emergence of the networks required for the system to adapt and respond appropriately. Collective impact is a whole different modality of change. This is about building the collective intelligence of the group and importantly the collective agency of the group, the focus is on aligning the actors in the system to share goals.

As no one organization can change a system the aim of the system changer is to build Ecosystems and this means making connections that facilitate the redirection of flows of resources and collaborations into patterns of organization that are capable of responding successfully to the challenge at hand. It is about building new forms of ecosystems of actors that have the diversity, capabilities and cooperative structures to function as superorganisms, beyond what the organizations of today are capable of. We are trying to build an adaptive scalable, sustainable ecosystem of actors and at the heart of this is the idea of collaboration. In this section we are going to explore these key aspects required to change systems; collaboration, ecosystem building and how we scale and sustain them over time.

---

**Collaboration**

Many of the complex challenges we face today are largely a function of our fractured ways of looking at the world and the fractured ways of operating that follow from this. For example, we can ask why do we fail to provide adequate services to people with multiple disadvantages? Because service providers, from many different areas, are not able to effectively coordinate around their needs, the result being that we deliver fractured services. Likewise, our lack of capacity to effectively coordinate politically is often identified as being at the core of our failures to respond to the demand of a changing climate. Overfishing, the water crisis, the development of sustainable cities, all of these have at their heart the need for new forms of networked collaboration and this is at the center of what we are trying to realize when doing system change in many different contexts.

As Otto Scharmer notes, it is about moving from a fragmented ego-system to an integrated ecosystem approach. In his words: "We need a new model, a new coordination mechanism, that does not revolve around special interest and organized interest groups, but that revolves around seeing and acting from the whole, that revolves around the systemic capacity of key actors to pull together around commons, rather than pursuing abstract groups interests that are in conflict with each other on the macro level… What we need is a new systemic collective innovation capacity that innovates the system, at the scale of the whole and not just in small pockets of the system." [89]

Collaborating to develop vital ecosystems that support innovation for systems change requires a radical change in both mindset and behavior, not only at the organizational level but also at the personal level. It requires working across sectors and cultures, against the odds, managing for the fractures and alignments between people. To build broad, wide, deep networks of people around a systemic problem requires scanning the whole system, getting inside of the lives of the people within it, understanding their position and seeing both the gaps and needs that are inhibiting collaboration.

Our current predominant behavior within organizations is to create predetermined solutions which we then push out when what is needed is almost the complete opposite, for large-scale change we need more to deal with rules of interaction. Think about our cities, neighborhood interactions are like feedback loops, the question is how can we enable those interactions to happen and allow solutions to emerge. What we are looking for is a more collaborative approach to change which is focused not on creating solutions or organizations but simply looking where the potential for synergies - i.e. collaboration - lies in the system and then working with those to create something organic.

**Unusual Suspects**

Systems change shifts our problem-solving approach from the creation and growth of long-life projects and organizations with ever-growing staff and budgets to instead identifying the individuals already working on a problem, and helping them join forces to achieve their common goals. At its heart this is about making connections, creating synergies between existing actors to try and realize the emergence of functional ecosystems.

As Jeffrey C. Walker remarks in his article in the Stanford Social Innovation Review "the message is clear: Our focus should be more on solving problems through creative collaboration, and less on the establishment and perpetuation of new institutions. Besides, we need to develop and employ system entrepreneurs who are skilled in coordinating systematic approaches to addressing the complex, large-scale problems of our time." [90]

To get emergence in any kind of a system, it is required that there be both diversity and coordination between the constituent parts. The greater the diversity and the coordination the greater the complexity and the greater the emergence. If we want to tackle really complex problems we are going to need some really capable emergent organization which implies high levels of both diversity and coordination.

This means we need everyone, not just the most important people or the smartest, richest or most powerful, we need all the different competencies. Even the person who knows nothing, and has nothing, knows something about their own condition and their own view of the system and this is needed to get something comprehensive. Collaboration is about building on human competence, not on our failings, if we can do that - both personally and as a group - we can start to unlock and discover what is already there but hidden in some other part of the organization which we did not know of because of our bias and the preconceptions that divide us. Multidimensional collaboration is not about harmony it is about navigating differences to realize the progress that is, in the end, better for all.

The aim is to create structures that enable people to recognize others, their difference, to dialogue in a way that helps us listen to each other, that helps us to understand the different perspectives of where they are coming from and that helps us to acknowledge difference even if we do not agree, this is a crucial cornerstone. Collaboration starts with the question of how do we meet each other and how do we connect with a larger story.

Collaborative leadership helps people identify their roles, we have to create processes to help them to do this. We have to design systems and processes that can take a large group of people and lead them through a process that both brings out their unique knowledge, perspective, and resources, but also integrate that into a whole. A process that can work to turn conflict and dissonance into consensus and coherence over time. In the process, the different actors interact and form new identities within that context, new roles as part of the whole.

Innovation has the aspect of creativity and the question is how do we bring in a different quality of interaction that enables that creativity, rather than the more traditional kinds of managerial interaction that we see within many organizations of today.

**Overcoming Divides**

Collaboration is part of the sense-making process, we have to make sense of each other and how to work together given the differences that divide us. The moment people can see a story behind a difficult to understand behavior of others, why people insisted on a certain position and how this position actually developed in their history - the moment they can see the human being with fears and anxieties and with interests, with their human capacity and their human failures - the moment that happens, the climate between people can change and the capacity to connect successfully can accelerate.

Humanity in the collaboration process is a very strong competence. To be able to step into the shoes of somebody else and to look at the world from somebody else's perspective is key. This is not magic it can be organized, with the right understanding and process people can see each other as people. This can be formalized in the way we collaborate, the way we meet with each other, in our ability to listen to each other's perspectives and to listen to the stories that have emerged and that have made people the way they are. At the end of the day, this is about progressing and processing these differences into better solutions and the emergence of some form of collective Intelligence.

Kerry Graham of Collaboration for Impact identifies some of the key dynamics involved here when she notes: "you have to understand how to design processes for human beings ones that do hearts, minds, and hands but you also need to facilitate... Everyone arrives in a collaborative process basically saying, I'm here to understand what I can get out of this for my part of the system, and you have to create a process strong enough to move them from what is actually very isolated self-interest to shared purpose, and I don't think we talk about this stuff enough." [91]

**Collaboration**

A key challenge we have in realizing systems change is in understanding and creating collaborations, why people do and or do not come together and what determines if those partnerships are of value and sustainable. It is quite apparent that we need to shift the paradigm when it comes to putting ourselves and our organizations secondary to whatever forms of collaboration that are needed to realize the systems change that we want to see in the world.

The realization of a truly circular economy would be one such example. At present different organizations know that they have to collaborate, to work across the circular economy and there are different organizations in that space but they can not quite find the right route to sharing the skill base that they have and their capabilities.

Many of these organizations are currently incentivized in the wrong way. For example, in the world of NGOs, often we find that organizations are competing for funding, Here the business models, the funding and the flow of money that drives these organizations works to maintain the current system without the incentives to collaborate in the ways needed. [92]

It is quite apparent that changing these kinds of incentives and mastering the somewhat mysterious art of collaboration will be at the heart of building new functional ecosystems for system change. This is both an art and a science, it requires a deep understanding of humans and what makes them tick but also it is about good processes that can guide them through a journey of growing systems awareness and ways for them to work together productively.

**Collective Impact**

Finally, as a concrete take away, we can take a look at Collective Impact's list of elements for collaboration first described in the 2011 Stanford Social Innovation Review. There 5 conditions for collective impact are as follows. [93]

- Common Agenda: Common understanding of the problem and a shared vision for change
- Shared Measurements: Collecting data and measuring results focus on performance management shared accountability
- Mutually reinforcing activities: Differentiated approaches coordinated through a joint plan of action
- Continuous Communications: Consistent and open communication focus on building trust
- Backbone Support: Separate organization(s) with staff. Resources and skills to convene and coordinate participating organizations

**Ecosystems**

Systems change is about a recognition that given a complex challenge there are no simple solutions and no one individual or organization can get the results they desire without working collaboratively with others, as such systems change is about building these collaborative ecosystems.

This change in paradigm is nicely illustrated by John Cawley of the J.W. McConnell Family Foundation when he says “we realized after spending millions over the years that we were not having the systems impact we needed, and wanted, due to the complexity and size of the issues… So we redefined our role; we are curators or stewards of the ecosystem around an issue … We can be the connective tissue between parts of the ecosystem.” [94]

Ecological thinking has for some time formed a key part of the systems change approach as it provides robust ways of thinking about the formation of complex and diverse collaborations. This re-imagining of the conditions of systems change as an ‘ecosystem’ offers both a valuable narrative and an analytical framework. The analogy of the ‘ecosystem’ captures our imagination and stimulates us to think differently about what we are trying to create as an open and dynamic network of people and organizations that may give rise to the higher-level emergent capabilities that we are hoping to realize. [95]

With ecosystems thinking the question shifts from what is the solution to a more subtle one of, how do we facilitate these interactions that lead to more successful higher-level outcomes? It is not just that organizations see that they have to work together but it is also about the organizations being able to give up the idea of there being a simple solution and their desire to control everything.

**Context**

Context is king here, and as a systems changer it is our job to create the context. Petra Kuenkel, founder and director of the Collective Leadership Institute, notes this when she says: "I have also discovered that people shift into a collaborative space when they are able to look beyond their limited world view, the moment they feel they are operating in a context suddenly their willingness to find ways together or their internal attitude shifts and they become more willing to contribute rather than be in competition."

Relations are formed because there is a context for them to form within - communities are built out of context. I don't start talking to the person right next to me on the metro in the morning, but I do start to talk to the person next to me at the conference, the difference is nothing but context. To create ecosystems is to create connections, but to create connections we have to create context. If we want a robust and strong community we are going to have to work with and develop the context within which those connections can form. This context can take many forms, for example, geographic proximity is a context that we can use. Context creates a "space" that gets people to recognize each other and creates the potential for them to connect.

Many of the contexts that we create and inhabit are based upon assumptions of zero-sum games that context then feeds back to condition the types of relationships we create which end up being zero-sum also. To break this cycle you have to take people outside of their normal environment and create a context that engenders different principles.

**Holistic View**

We need to take a holistic view so that we can see the whole field of operation, to place our actions in the context of the actions of other people, other institutions, other actors in the field. This is about trying to understand the whole field and that we think about how this field creates a joint impact rather than isolated islands of success.

Wholeness means our ability to look at the larger context and constantly cross-check in what context are we actually operating in. This is difficult and in reality even those of us who claim to be systems thinkers often fail in this. We take a partial few of the whole and align ourselves with that while ignoring other aspects that do not fit so well with our view of the world.

But creating ecosystems is about this holistic vision, seeing the risks and opportunities to the whole and then translating that into a language and narrative that is intelligible to others, so that they can see there interdependence in working towards the goals they individually wish to achieve.

Taking a holistic perspective also means taking a multi-dimensional perspective. While an ecosystem may grow to address an entrenched problem, the focus is on multiple points of intervention over time to tip the system, avoiding the technical trappings of any one solution, multiple domains, multiple scales, multiple geographies, cultures, etc.

Ecosystems are more than just about cooperation and collaboration they are also about building collective intelligence. Flexibility and accelerated co-learning are important potential advantages relative to vertically integrated structures. To have an ecosystem we have to ask is there a collective intelligence process? Are we listening to each other? Are we contributing to a larger story?

**Keystones**

While systems change is about distributed capabilities it is also clear there are ‘keystone’ players who play critical roles in the success of initiatives. These actors are critical conveners and creators of connections and relationships that enable transformative collaboration. Keystone does not mean that they are at the center or have all the power, it means that they have network power through linking. [96]

These keystone actors may be variously termed: Systems Entrepreneurs or Intrapreneurs, Systems Changers, Social Curators, Partnership Brokers, Ecosystem Builders. “Systems entrepreneurs” refer to social innovators who are intentionally adopting systems change strategies in their efforts. Systems change is qualitatively different from providing products and services, it involves a departure from growing the work of a single organization to coordinating and influencing the work of multiple actors in the creation of ecosystems.

In the paper Building Ecosystems For Systems Change, they summarized three distinct keystone traits as "Integrative: human bridges connecting people to a larger contiguous system; Influential: focusing others on long-term interests and time horizons through appeal and establishing new cultural norms, and; Impactful: making things happen and fostering real economic transactions that create a systemic effect, not just get a few people excited for a short time."

**Key Elements**

If we are successful the outcome will be a powerful ecosystem of diverse actors that are aligned in channeling capabilities and resources in the right way at the right challenge, however, it takes a long time to get there, we start on the journey by building connections, one at a time, it is a manual process.

Indy Johar identifies several key aspects to building these ecosystems for system change, these are: recognized, coordinate, collaborate and synthesize. [97] Ecosystems start by members first recognizing each other as part of the solution, they connect and coordinate, then collaborate and we see the emergent synthesis that can change things. This formation process is what we would call self-organization.

Collaborative change requires building shared understanding, shared language and ultimately some form of collective intelligence. It is critical to remember that systems change will be thwarted if we do things to people, or for them, rather than with them; ecosystem building is fundamentally a co-creative process.

**Scaling**

Systems change is about changing what are often large complex systems and given their magnitude a key consideration for many involved in systems change is that of scale - how do we get from small initiatives to changing whole systems? How do we get from influencing parts to changing the whole?

Traditionally we approach this scaling issue by simply producing more, that is to say, creating some viable product and then duplicating that to scale outwards. In this respect, the model used by many research organizations is one of discovery, proof of concept, piloting, and scaling. [98]

In a paper entitled "Scaling – from 'reaching many' to sustainable systems change at scale" the authors start by noting: "countless development projects have piloted solutions that could make a difference if only applied at scale. The reality is that these pilot projects hardly ever reach the intended scale to contribute significantly." [99]

They go on to identify several common pitfalls in our current scaling approaches. First, pilot projects are usually set up and managed in very controlled environments that result in it being very difficult to transition to the real world at scale. Second, limited conceptual and methodological clarity on what scaling is and how it can be best achieved often results in a narrow focus on reaching numbers.

The authors recommend a broader view and approach towards scaling one which "involves complementing and reinforcing existing initiatives in the same domain and stimulating supportive interventions that help build a bigger dynamic towards systems change."

Scaling system change is not about numbers but about changing the structure of the system. Thus instead of creating more projects or pilots, what is needed is to think about the protocols that interrelate existing solutions. It is connections that create the potential for nonlinear paradigm shifts, as when parts become interconnected in new ways suddenly a new pattern emerges and a new flow starts to happen; it is this emergence of new structures that creates a paradigm shift that we are looking for as systems changers.

**More Is Different**

Scaling is a process that has to happen in parallel fashion across many dimensions and levels of a system; simply reproducing the same solution to scale without changing the supporting conditions, institutional frameworks, cultural and social habits, etc. will result in inevitable blockages. This is illustrated by the rise of today's digital platforms which have scaled to have a huge impact on societies and economies with little of the needed parallel changes taking place to accommodate that; the result is an inevitable mismatch creating frictions and tensions like we see with Airbnb or Upwork without the true systems changing potential of those innovations being realized.

Jordan Kassalow, Founder of VisionSpring, highlights some of the issues here when he remarks: “It became obvious to me that we could grow 50% or even 100% a year for many years to come and still never be up to the challenge of solving this problem. It became stressful for me to think about scaling from 2 million to 3 million to 5 million – huge numbers for any social entrepreneur – but still, just a drop in the bucket compared to the 2.5 billion people who need this simple product. And the reason I launched a multistakeholder alliance is because the barriers to solving this problem, like cultural issues, custom duties, and supply chain problems, cannot be solved at an enterprise level.”

Treating scaling as a transformation process helps deal with the necessary coevolution of organizational and institutional arrangements, along with the innovations in technology or practice. In complex systems more is not the same it is different and we need to be thinking that through as we go along not in hindsight. The essence of this is captured in the title of the famous research paper on emergence called "more is different." If we look at how many companies scale it is largely a "more is the same" approach which often leads to problems as they fail to recognize that as things get to a certain size they start to change the environment they operate in and this feeds back to change the context and conditions of the innovation.

Successful scaling is not necessarily quantitative, and bigger is not always better. Qualitative indicators such as sustainability, satisfaction, and quality of life are also key metrics for success. We need to shift from “maximum potential scale” for a few organizations - as is the traditional venture capital model that allows for a few unicorns - to “optimal, or responsible scale” for many that allows for many organizations to work synergistically towards the emergence of the new pattern or systems structure.

**Pattern Scaling**

The social entrepreneur Jeroo Billimoria talks about this scaling issue as such: “Very often, scale is looked at as scaling an organization or enterprise as opposed to scaling a concept. Looking beyond scaling a particular organization requires a major mindset shift. We must determine how we can collaboratively scale action around a particular problem through the engagement of all the stakeholders affected by the issue. Only then will we make meaningful changes in how complex social problems are taken on.” [100]

Rather than duplication of parts systems change scales through abstraction, the way to achieve large scale systems change is not through more things but to change patterns, to duplicate patterns, to scale patterns. The aim should be to start with a small group of people who form what we call "a creative integrity" who are willing to stand for something and maintain commitment and energy over the time that it grows, to create a self-reinforcing pattern.

**Movements**

Traditional thinking is that it just takes a few smart people to come up with some good ideas and then everyone else to duplicate them to get scale. Instead, systems change should be seen more as being about unlocking the collective genius of everyone and this is why the best systems innovations should be seen as movements.

As Charles Leadbeater remarks "Innovation really takes off when it becomes a movement, when you get this movement of ideas, technology, organization, a culture which leads to a kind of momentum that creates its own kind of scale and finds its own flow of resources to push it through.”

Successful systems innovation is invariably part of a larger story of social change which embraces consumers, innovators, business and policy; movements make markets, change norms and flip systems.

Movements have to not only engage people but also move people. They have to have not only good logic and a compelling narrative but also an emotional drive. As Petra Kuenkel says "the answer to urgency [of sustainability challenges] is tapping into the potential of the human heart.”

Movements don't last forever, like startups are to businesses, movements are to social change or system change, you can't stay a startup forever, nor a social movement, either you scale up and become some established pattern of organization or some other pattern will occupy that space.

In the next section, we will discuss platforms as an organizational form for structuring these movements and turning them into the powerful "institutions" needed to sustain lasting change.

---

**Platforms**

As previously discussed the aim of systems change is not to create an organization or an institution, but instead to create an ecosystem of actors working synergistically to adapt, innovate and respond effectively to the challenges they face. These ecosystems need some kind of supporting infrastructure to make them work, what Collaborative Impact calls a "Backbone Support". As they remark: "Creating and managing collective impact requires a separate organization and staff with a very specific set of skills to serve as the backbone for the entire initiative. The expectation that collaboration can occur without a supporting infrastructure is one of the most frequent reasons why it fails." [101]

The backbone organization is an independent entity different from the participating organizations that can support and organize the initiative through ongoing communications support, facilitation, technology, data collection, and managing the many logistical and organizational details needed for the initiative to function well. In an age of information technology and the rise of the internet this common infrastructure may be best called a platform.

As Banny Banerjee of Stanford ChangeLab puts it "The first thing is to create platforms that are around causes rather than going forward with your technology or your offering. If you can create a forum around a larger issue, around the cause you create a platform, even if a single organization starts leading the endeavor the attempt is to attract the other players around that cause."

**Collaborative Platforms**

Collaboration has become a new vibrant word over the past few decades, in the face of ever more complex challenges the call for collaboration grows. But the kind of collaboration that is needed is of a different kind and order to the one we have known in the past; a form that was ad-hoc, and always pushing against larger systemic structures that were driving towards competition and individuality. For systems change to be successful we need to build shared infrastructure, networks that have cooperation as a default, inbuilt, across a large system of people who may not even know each other.

With the rise of information technology, the cooperation vs competition equation is changing. As John Hagel of Deloitte's Center for the Edge notes: "The ability at cost to coordinate activity within a single institution is much less than trying to coordinate activity across multiple independent institutions. That was a very compelling and accurate description of the institutions that emerged during the twentieth century, scalable efficiency drove the success of those institutions. I would like to suggest that that rationale is diminishing in its impact today largely as a result of the digital technology infrastructure available to us the ability to coordinate activity across massive independent entities is decreasing at an ever rapid rate." This ability to coordinate activity across independent entities should be seen as a new and vital resource for realizing sustainable collaborative ecosystems.

**Institutions**

Successful system change creates movements for change, however, movements are transitory processes of change. At some point, our movement or ecosystem needs to solidify into something coherent and sustainable. Movements inevitably turn into institutions over time or else they die out. The development of a new pattern of organization - a movement - requires significant resources and energy that can't be sustained forever, a new structure has to solidify to support it. In short, movements change or become institutions.

Institutions are simply established patterns of organization within society and economy that regulate and coordinate human activity and interaction. Such institutions can take many forms, from legal systems to customs, to dress codes or even whole cultures. When we hear the term institution we are inclined to think of some large building with a bureaucracy inside it. Today, however, given the advent of digital communications we have available to us new ways to interact and create organizations. Platforms are a new kind of institution that harnesses the power of digital technology and connectivity to enable the functional coordination of large disparate groups of individuals or organizations.

The key aspect of the platform is that it removes the bureaucratic structure found at the center of most industrial age organizations and it instead replaces it with a piece of software that does the coordination automatically, while using the internet as a way to interconnect people and things so that they can connect and coordinate in the production and exchange of value.

Digital platforms are needed to create innovation ecosystems because they remove the need for a large cumbersome bureaucratic structure to coordinate activities among a large and diverse group of actors. They are also critical in that they can automate basic procedures and operations so that time and energy and resources can be shifted to the realm of innovation rather than being spent on routine predictable and standardized procedures.

Like all organizations platforms engender a key dynamic between top-down and bottom-up organizations. As Petra Kuenkel remarks: "Transformations take place in complex adaptive systems and thrive best in an appropriate mix between collective stewardship and self-organization." Unlike the traditional bureaucratic centralized organization that attempts to specify desired outcomes in a top-down fashion, platforms do not specify outcomes, but set the rules and protocols for the interaction and thus influence the outcomes and workings of the whole system.

**Modularity**

One reason why initiatives can fail is that they create an overall vision but are not able to integrate people into that effectively. Everyone has their own agenda and motives, few are likely to give up their vision and adopt yours wholeheartedly, what is needed is a platform that is flexible enough for people to contribute to it in different ways on different levels; a platform that is modular rather than monolithic in its design.

We need to analyze the structure of the initiative, asking is it monolithic or modular. Monolithic often means that value is only derived to the project as a whole. Monolithic processes are often linear, one thing follows another leading to the outcome and all is gained or lost if the outcome works, likewise everyone has to believe in the outcome, meaning there can be high barriers to success.

In contrast, the modular approach means that many parts are coming together to compose a whole, it is as such nonlinear. Modularity is a key design principle of complex systems as they involve many diverse parts that are loosely coupled. Imposing a strong design pattern that constrains a complex organization within a fixed overall pattern typically does not work or is unsustainable.

The same is true of complex projects that involve many stakeholders with their own agenda and motives, we need something that is nonlinear and loosely coupled. Likewise in order to get the engagement of diverse parties - some of whom may not even be aware of your overall vision - the project needs to be designed in a modular way that delivers increments of value to those who are involved.

This is not to say that the overall process is incremental. It is your job to avoid incrementalism by designing a system where all these little parts start to work synergistically to sum up to something greater than their increments alone; that they at a certain point come together to create a new and coherent pattern at which stage the members start to recognize themselves as part of something greater and now see the value in the initiative - because it new works.

It is difficult to sell things and get buying from people with only a vision, the way around this is to get small engagements from members that directly deliver value to them without them having to make the big leap of faith into your overall vision and project.

Thus the platform has to deliver value not just as a whole project but also in a discrete modular way for those individuals and organizations that want to engage with it on an individual level. Realizing large scale change is best done by creating something open, whose value proposition is clear and makes sense, it delivers immediate modular units of value to the diversity of actors that you need to engage.

**Two-Sided Markets**

Platforms remove the centralized component and work by providing people with the tools to connect and exchange value peer-to-peer. This makes it possible to scale these networks like it is not possible when there is a centralized entity providing services. The combination of removing bureaucratic procedures and services while also leveraging the power of automation and connectivity makes it possible for platforms to scale at very low cost to very large numbers while at the same time remaining agile enough to make large scale systems innovation possible.

This model has the added advantage of creating network effects, where the system endogenously and organically draws in more users growing exponentially. The key to scaling platforms is not only to deliver discrete and identifiable units of value but also to harness the power of connectivity and networks to grow.

Network effects are the incremental benefit gained by an existing user for each new user that joins the network. The telephone is one such example, the phone is only useful if other people also have a phone. If only one person owns a phone, the value of the phone network is zero, because they cannot connect to anyone with it. If a second person owns a phone, then the first person can call the second person, a third etc. every new user joining the network adds value for everyone else.

When a platform attains a critical mass of users, the cost of joining the platform is outweighed by the value of joining, with most of that value being derived from the power of the network. This creates an attractor that organically draws people in without the need for advertising or special effort from the creator of the platform. Thus platforms grow not by acquiring more assets, but by acquiring more users, which has a near-zero cost. Here again, we can see that we can build powerful engines for system change at virtually no cost. Systems are patterns of organization changing them is about changing patterns and information technology allows us to do that at near-zero cost.

**Conclusion**

The aim of systems change is to create sustainable social, economic, technological and socio-ecological systems. This means changing the linear fractured systems of today that inherently create negative externalities to systems that create positive externalities which work to build and sustain the distributed resources in the system.

To realize sustainable results is to build structures that will reinforce the behavior and the outcomes of positive externalities, and ensure that the people in the system want to buy into those structures and buy into those outcomes. In this respect, we have realized systems change when we have created a sufficient number of relations, synergies, and dynamics such that the system that once perpetuated a “problem” now instead perpetuates a solution. [102] We can say it is sustainable when we have created a "game" that people want to engage in - as it is the attractor in the system - and it creates positive externalities that replenish the system's infrastructure and environment over time.

**Vitality**

There are no solutions in complex systems, wicked problems are never really solved. Many of these wicked problems are inherent to the system, such as inequality, inequality will always be with us, however, there is healthy and unhealthy inequality. The measure of success is not quantitative, it is qualitative, as captured by the sense of the people that the system is "alive" or not.

Generally speaking, we can say that at the core of systems change is the aim of creating vitality in systems, we are trying to create systems that are in a sense "alive". This is not to fall into an overly simplifying assumption that life is "good" and death is "bad", both are necessary, however, what we are trying to do is create regenerative systems.

Systems thinking and change is nonlinear, we are not focusing on one specific thing but instead the distributed resources within the system. It is out of these distributed resources that new capabilities and the things we value can emerge. The capacity for the system to regenerate and sustain, itself over time is there in those distributed resources, that is the measurement of success it is the measurement of the "health" of the whole system, not one part or one metric. As Petra Kuenkel says "the degree of life in a particular system is created by the mutually supportive living centers this system contains."

**Adaptive Learning**

This emergent process of organization formation requires rapid feedback loops to enable experimenting your way into doing what works and away from what doesn't. These feedback loops need to be operating on various levels. When we look at what sustains ecosystems and enables them to maintain balance and develop over time it is a multiplicity of feedback loops on different levels.

Single loop learning corrects and refines existing routines so they operate more effectively. Double-loop learning reframes or reforms assumptions and strategies guiding interventions and governance processes. Triple loop learning challenges and changes the established ways of doing things, changes the accepted paradigm and reframes values.

An action learning approach is needed, which is an approach to solving real problems that involve taking action and reflecting upon the results, working to improve the problem-solving process over time. Donella Meadows's famous saying "dancing with systems" highlights the need for an ongoing adaptive evolutionary approach to systems change. There is no silver bullet, there is no one intervention or one point in time when you "solve" a wicked problem it is an ongoing process of action and learning.
