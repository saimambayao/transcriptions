**CHAPTER 2**

**Regional Trends and Prospects**

The BARMM is endowed with rich natural resources and a number of comparative advantages that can be utilized to improve the current state of the region, its government, and its people. Its full potential can be harnessed by taking advantage of the positive developments at the local and national levels. The BOL which provides greater powers to the Bangsamoro government towards charting its direction is among those development opportunities.

The Bangsamoro government is optimistic about improving the state of governance in order to secure self-governance for social, political, and economic transformation.

Emerging global and regional opportunities for Halal and Islamic finance, as well as the strong support from President Duterte’s administration to peace and development augur well for the region’s socioeconomic development. However, persisting issues and challenges need to be addressed through the implementation of the 1st BDP 2020-2022 for the regional government to attain its desired goals in the next three years.

**Demographic, Socioeconomic, and Political Trends**

**Fastest Growing Population**

The BARMM has a population of 4,273,149, which includes Cotabato City and the 63 barangays from North Cotabato. The Bangsamoro region has the fastest growing population in Mindanao with an average annual growth rate of 2.9 percent from 2010-2015, while Zamboanga Peninsula recorded the lowest population growth rate with 1.2 percent.

Based on the 2015 growth rate, BARMM will double its population by 2040 (see Table 2.1 for BARMM population and growth rates). Maguindanao is the most populous among the BARMM provinces followed by Lanao del Sur and Sulu. On the other hand, Tawi-Tawi and Basilan has the least population in the region.

With the unique political structure of the region under a parliamentary setup and the creation of the Commission on Population in the BARMM, responsive policies on responsible parenthood are expected to be in place. Muslim religious leaders are potential partners in the advocacy for responsible parenthood and reproductive health (RPRH) through the popularization of the Fatwa on Family Planning, Reproductive Health, and the Reproductive Law in the BARMM.

### Growing Economy, Albeit Slow and Fluctuating

The Bangsamoro economy (composed of previous ARMM territories) is growing at a positive rate, albeit slow and fluctuating. In 2018, the region is one of those that experienced accelerated economic growth in the country. Given the current reform initiatives in the BARMM, the Bangsamoro government is optimistic in sustaining positive growth in the succeeding years.

Agriculture, forestry, and fishing (AFF) still dominates the region’s economy, contributing 55.6 percent. This is followed by the services sector at 38.5 percent share, while the industry sector accounted for 5.9 percent. See Table 2.2 for percentage distribution of gross regional domestic product (GRDP) by industrial origin for 2016-2018.

The services sector posted the highest growth rate in 2018 at 9.4 percent, which surpassed the 6.7 percent growth rate in 2017. This was attributed to the performance of all its subsectors. Compulsory social security recorded the highest rate at 13.2 percent, followed by motorcycle, personal and household goods at 10.8 percent; other services at 10.1 percent; financial intermediation at 9.7 percent; and transportation, storage, and communication at 9.4 percent.
