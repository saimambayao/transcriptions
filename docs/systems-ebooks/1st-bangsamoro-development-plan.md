### Message from the NEDA

The formulation of the First Bangsamoro Development Plan (1st BDP) 2020-2022 within the term of the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2017-2022 and the transition period of the Bangsamoro Government is a legacy not only for being the first plan formulated for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) but also because it is a breakthrough – after the long struggle for identity and self-governance, the aspirations of the Bangsamoro government and its constituents are now laid into one plan.

We are pleased to work with the Bangsamoro government towards achieving a strongly rooted (*Matatag*), comfortable (*Maginhawa*) and secure (*Panatag*) Philippines. The BDP is an essential part of the PDP 2017-2022 in its remaining term as it will accelerate the reformation and development of the Bangsamoro communities.

More importantly, the 1st BDP 2020-2022 will guide both public and private investments that will spur growth in the region. It will also serve as the blueprint of the Bangsamoro Government in laying down the foundation of inclusive growth, a high-trust and resilient society, and a globally competitive knowledge economy by 2022.

With this, I would like to invite the Bangsamoro people to take part in realizing this historic development plan.

Congratulations to the Bangsamoro Economic and Development Council (BEDC) for adopting the 1st BDP 2020-2022!

### Message from the Chief Minister

Assalamu Alaykum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu!

We have struggled for decades to arrive to where we are today. We firmly believe that it is only through moral governance that we can truly deliver the services needed by our people so that their deplorable current state of living which resulted from underdevelopment, marginalization, deprivation and poverty can change and improve thus making their lives better.

We formulated our 1st Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP) 2020-2022 by taking into consideration the Bangsamoro people’s unique needs and aspirations, and aligning it with the development thrusts of the national government and the sustainable development goals.

The Plan is also consistent with our 12-point priority agenda which define our priorities and focus on interventions for the next three years. The 1st BDP 2020-2022 defines our strategies, priority policies, and programs/projects geared towards the attainment of our overall goal given the present context. The 1st BDP 2020-2022 is our Plan for success, *In Shaa’Allah*.

Given the limited time for the transition, we know that we can only do so much. Nonetheless, we will do our best to deliver the needed reforms and services through the setting up of necessary structures, systems and processes and the enactment of priority legislations and other deliverables as contained in the Bangsamoro Organic Law.

We directed our ministries, line agencies, and offices in the region to maximize the available resources in the implementation of development priorities outlined in this Plan.

We also implored the support of our development partners in the implementation of the programs/projects of the Bangsamoro Government to help us attain our goal of uplifting the lives of the Bangsamoro and establishing the foundations for self-governance through moral governance.

*In’Shaa’Allah*, we are hopeful that we will be able to deliver the needed services and succeed in the realization of our development agenda towards a better and prosperous Bangsamoro region where no one is left behind.

### Preface

Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu.

All praises and thanks be to Allah for the guidance in the crafting of this 1st Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP) 2020-2022 and its accompanying documents, the Results Matrices (RM) and the Bangsamoro Development Investment Program (BDIP).

This Plan serves as the roadmap for development of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. It contains strategies and priority programs and projects responsive to the needs of our constituents.

The crafting of the 1st BDP 2020-2022 adheres to the Office of the Chief Minister’s Memorandum Order No. 311 series of 2019 directing the ministries, line agencies, and offices to align their agency plans, programs, and projects to the 12-Point Agenda of the Chief Minister and Memorandum Order No. 449 directing the formulation of the 1st Bangsamoro Plan and creating for the purpose the five (5) Planning Committees to spearhead the planning process. The Plan is aligned and contributes to the *Ambisyon Natin 2040*, 0-10-Point Socioeconomic Agenda of the Duterte Administration, Philippine Development Plan, 2017-2022 Midterm Update and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

This Plan is distinct in as much as it was the first plan that harmonizes existing development plans of the Bangsamoro like the Regional Development Plan 2017-2022 (ARMM), United Bangsamoro Development Plan (MILF and MNLF), Bangsamoro Development Plan 1 and 2 (BDA-MILF). The consultations were conducted in the five (5) provinces of the region, including Cotabato City and the 63 Barangays in North Cotabato, and the CSOs from the aforementioned localities. These consultations were carried out hand in hand with the PCs, namely: 1) Development Administration Planning Committee, 2) Peace, Public Order, and Safety Planning Committee, 3) Economic Development Planning Committee, 4) Social Development Planning Committee, and 5) Infrastructure Development Planning Committee in order to ensure the formulation of a well-coordinated and responsive Plan that will serve as a blueprint for the development of the BARMM for the next three (3) years and beyond.

The Plan underscores the uniqueness of the region with its distinct geographical setting which now includes Cotabato City and the 63 barangays in North Cotabato as a result of the ratification of the RA 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law.

The Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority (BPDA) is privileged to lead this historical process of formulating the first ever Bangsamoro Development Plan of the Bangsamoro Government.

Our grateful acknowledgment is sincerely extended to our development partners and consultants for their invaluable support. May our collaboration for this roadmap allay our development works for the improvement of lives of the Bangsamoro.

Shukran and Wassalam!

### CHAPTER 1: The BARMM and the Transition

#### Historical Background
Historical injustices, persistent abuses, and marginalization in Mindanao fostered mistrust and resistance among the Moro people which resulted in protracted violence in the region. Notably, the Jabidah massacre in 1968 was among the many incidents that heightened Moro desire to exercise their right to self-determination and demand for independence from the Republic of the Philippines.

These incidents triggered the formation of various Muslim revolutionary groups, namely: (a) the Muslim Independence Movement (MIM) in 1968; (b) the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) under Nur Misuari in 1973; and (c) the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) under the late Ustadz Hashim Salamat in 1978.

The Government of the Philippines (GRP) engaged the MNLF and the MILF in peace processes to find political solutions to the problems and put an end to war and violence in Mindanao. The Tripoli Final Peace Agreement between the GRP and the MNLF, which called for the establishment of autonomy covering 13 provinces and nine (9) cities in Mindanao was signed on December 23, 1976. Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1618 declared the areas covered in the Tripoli Agreement as Interim Autonomous Regions headed by two (2) regional commissioners. The Office of Regional Commissioners was abolished on September 20, 1979 through PD 1639 and their powers were transferred to the *Lupong Tagapagpaganap ng Pook*.

The creation and strengthening of the ARMM was intended to address the call for self-governance and bring about development in the southern part of the country. However, it was perceived that the ARMM fell short of delivering the benefits of peace to the Bangsamoro.

In October 2012, the Government of the Philippines (GPH) and the MILF signed the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro (FAB) and the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB) in March 2014. These provided for the creation of a new political entity that will replace ARMM, as well as stipulations of several transitional processes and modalities.

The enabling bill of the CAB, the proposed Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL), was submitted to and deliberated by the Philippine Congress. However, the backlash of the failed military operation against the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) during the Mamasapano incident in 2015 affected the passage of the proposed law.

In 2016, when President Rodrigo Roa Duterte assumed the presidency, the Six-Point Peace and Development Agenda were introduced to push for the implementation of standing peace agreement. The Bangsamoro Transition Commission (BTC) was also reconstituted through the issuance of Executive Order No. 8, which expanded the membership from 15 to 21 allowing more participation in the drafting of the new BBL. The new version of the enabling law, the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) bill, was submitted in July 2017 for legislation.

The Philippine Congress the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), repealing for the purpose Republic Act 6734 as amended by RA 9054” (RA11054) or the Bangsamoro Organic Law. President Duterte signed it into law on July 27, 2018 and was ratified in a plebiscite in early 2019.

To foster genuine autonomy and moral governance, and improve fiscal management, the BOL created the BARMM as the new political entity replacing the ARMM and provided for a transition process. The ratification of the law commenced the transition period for the establishment of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

### BARMM Profile

The BARMM is composed of the following geographic areas covered by the previous ARMM: the five (5) provinces of Basilan, Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi; and the cities of Marawi and Lamitan. Other areas which voted “yes” during the plebiscite for the ratification of the BOL are Cotabato City and the 63 barangays in the municipalities of Aleosan, Carmen, Kabacan, Midsayap, Pigkawayan, and Pikit in the province of North Cotabato.

The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is now composed of five (5) provinces, two (2) component cities, one (1) independent city, 116 municipalities with 2,590 barangays and eight (8) congressional districts. With the inclusion of the new areas, the region has a population of 4,273,149 and a total land area of 12,711.79 square kilometers excluding the expanded areas. Figure 1.1 shows the BARMM territory, waters, and zones of joint cooperation³ while (Table 1.1) provides the administrative divisions of the region.

### The Transition: Its Implications to Regional Planning

The Transition plan aims to identify the new structural framework of the BARMM, based on the provisions of the Republic Act No. 11054, also known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law, taking into consideration the existing structure, budget, and other relevant features of the ARMM.

The BOL provides for the creation of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) which serves as the interim government in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region during the transition period from 2019 to 2022. The BTA is vested with executive and legislative powers and functions of the Bangsamoro Government as provided in the Organic Law during the transition period.

One of the responsibilities of the BTA is the preparation of the transition plan to aid in the dispensation of functions and priorities of the transition government. In June 2019, the Parliament adopted the BARMM Transition Plan that defines the structure and schedule of phasing out of the offices and employees under the former ARMM, which is set to be completed in December 2019.

The BOL further stipulates the preparation of a development plan for the region. Under the leadership of the Interim Chief Minister Ahod Balawag Ebrahim, the Bangsamoro government pursued the formulation of a development plan for the region for the period 2020-2022 as part of its priority agenda.

### Challenges for Regional Planning in the Transition

One of the major challenges confronting the Bangsamoro government is the implementation of the BARMM Transition Plan that ensures the smooth transition from ARMM to BARMM within the limited period. This has caused disruption of the functioning of the bureaucracy and the continued delivery of services to people while in the government is in transition.

The coming in of new entrants to the regional bureaucracy is both a challenge and opportunity in attaining the desired changes envisioned by the new Bangsamoro government. The newly hired personnel need to be capacitated and equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to meet governance requirements and expectations from the ground.

Another important provision of the BOL is the enactment of priority legislations to fully empower the BARMM in managing its affairs, which requires better coordination and collaborative efforts of the BTA officials in order to fast-track these legislations. These include the creation of offices defined in the transition plan, which is crucial for the effective functioning of the bureaucracy.

The abolition of the Regional Economic and Development Planning Board (REDPB) creates the urgency of a new law to establish the Bangsamoro Economic and Development Council (BEDC) and its committees. The BEDC will serve as the highest planning, coordinating, and monitoring body in the BARMM; facilitate the formulation and updating of the development

**1st Bangsamoro Development Plan 2020-2022**

plans of the Bangsamoro government; and recommend these plans for approval and legitimization by the Parliament.

On August 9, 2019, the Interim Chief Minister issued Memorandum Order No. 449, which directed the formulation of the 1st Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP) 2020-2022 through the five (5) Planning Committees (PCs) which facilitated the formulation process. This issuance is consistent with the Memorandum Order No. 01, s. 2019, issued by the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), which directed all government entities to update the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2017-2022, Results Matrices (RM), Public Investment Programs (PIP), and the respective regional plans and programs.

The formulation of the 1st BDP 2020-2022 was guided by the BOL, BARMM Transition Plan, BARMM 12-Point Priority Agenda, BARMM Planning Guidelines, PDP Midterm Update 2017-2022, NEDA Planning Guidelines, and with harmonization of other existing development plans such as ARMM-Regional Development Plan (RDP) 2017-2022, BDP1 & BDP2 by the Bangsamoro Development Agency (BDA), Unified Bangsamoro Development Plan (UBDP), and other relevant planning documents.

### Realities in the Transition Relevant to Regional Planning

The start of the transition process brought opportunities and challenges to the Bangsamoro. These realities were anticipated and considered in the formulation of the 1st BDP 2020-2022 to ensure that the proposed strategies and initiatives are responsive. The Plan includes proper implementation mechanisms and monitoring and evaluation.

**Poor investment programming could lead to overlapping of functions and duplications of policies, activities, programs/projects, and services (PAPS) funded by the national and Bangsamoro government.**

The transition to a new form of government carries issues and concerns plaguing the Bangsamoro region since its establishment. The lack of coordination and consultation between and among the national implementing agencies and their regional counterparts resulted in overlapping of functions and duplication of PAPS.

Weak vertical linkages among planning, investment programming, and budgeting are also a contributing factor. In most instances, despite the availability of funds, the proposed programs or projects are not ready for implementation causing delays. The tendency of the national government agencies to prepare programs or projects without due consultation with the regional counterparts also contributed to the problem.
