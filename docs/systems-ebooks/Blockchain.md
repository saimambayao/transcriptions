**Overview**

The Blockchain is a term that has come to mean many things to many people. For developers, it is a set of protocols and encryption technologies for securely storing data on a distributed network. For business and finance, it is a distributed ledger and the technology underlying the explosion of new digital currencies. For technologists, it is the driving force behind the next generation of the internet. For others, it is a tool for radically reshaping society and economy taking us into a more decentralized world.

Whichever way you look at it, blockchain has become a term that captures the imagination and fascinates many, as the implications of such technology are truly profound. For the first time in human history, people anywhere can trust each other and transact within large peer-to-peer networks without centralized management. Trust is established, not by centralized institutions, but by protocols, cryptography and computer code. This greatly strengthens our capacity for collaboration and cooperation between organizations and individuals within peer networks, enabling us to potentially form global networks of collaboration without centralized formal institutions; unprecedented but hugely relevant in an age of globalization and a new set of 21st-century challenges that require mass collaboration.

The blockchain is a complex technological, economic and social phenomenon. It calls into question what might have seemed to be established parameters of the modern world like currency, economics, trust, value, and exchange. To make sense of this one needs to understand it in a holistic context all the way from its technicalities to its aspirational potential, this course is designed to do exactly that, by giving an 360 degree overview to the different dimensions of the technology, its potential application within various industries and its far-reaching implications for society and economy.

In the first section of the course we give an overview to the blockchain both on a technical and nontechnical level we also discuss the importance of the blockchain within the context of the emerging next generation internet. In the second section we talk about the blockchain as a so call "trust machine" and how it enables transparency and collaboration, we will look at distributed ledger technology, talking about smart contracts, Ethereum, and decentralized applications. In the third section, we introduce you to the workings of token economies illustrating how the blockchain and distributed ledgers can work to build vibrant ecosystems through the use of tokens to incentivize behavior. In the last section of the course, we will be looking at specific applications of the blockchain to economy, society, technology, and environment, looking at both existing practical applications and potential future applications.

The blockchain is a so called emerging technology that is currently experiencing very rapid evolution, within the space of just two or three years it has already gone through changes in its technical implementation and our understanding of what it is and can be, have already changed significantly in just this brief time. As such our aim is to future proof this course by not dwelling excessively on existing technical implementations but presenting more a conceptual understanding of the blockchain within the broader process of change of the emerging next generation internet.

The blockchain is much more than a technology it is also a culture and community that is passionate about creating a more equitable world through decentralization, it is a movement to disrupt the disruptors, to redesign the internet and in so doing shake up existing centralized incumbents. Throughout the course, we will introduce you to this culture and its aspirations.

The course is non-technical in nature, it is an introductory course and thus all terms will be explained it should be accessible to anyone with a basic understanding of web technologies and economics.

**Blockchain Overview**

In this video, we are going to give a very high-level overview looking at the primary dimensions of this technology that we call the blockchain. We will firstly talk about the underlying technology, then the distributed ledgers that this technology supports, then the token economies that can be built on that ledger system. We will only touch upon these topics here to get an overview before going into them in more detail in future videos.

**Technology**

On its most basic level, the blockchain is a new class of information technology that combines encryption methods with distributed computing, both of which have existed for a number of decades. It was the genius of Satoshi Nakamoto to combine them in new ways to create a model where a network of computers collaborate to maintain a shared and secure database. As such we can say that the blockchain as a technology is simply a distributed secure database.

This database consists of a string of blocks each one a record of data that has been encrypted and given a unique identifier called a hash. Mining computers on the network validate transactions, add them to the block they are building, and then broadcast the completed block to other nodes so that all have a copy of the database. Because there is no centralized component to verify the validity of the alterations to the database the blockchain depends upon a distributed consensus algorithm. In order to make an entry on to the blockchain database, all the computers have to agree about its state so that no one computer can make an alteration without the consensus of the others.

Once completed, a block goes into the blockchain as a permanent record. Each time a block gets completed, a new one is generated. There is a countless number of such blocks in the blockchain, connected to each other, like links in a chain in proper linear, chronological order. The blockchain was designed so these transactions are immutable, meaning they cannot be deleted. Every block contains a hash value that is dependent on the hash of the previous block, so they are all linked meaning if one is changed then all the other blocks linked to it going forward will be altered. This works to make the data entered tamper-proof.

What we have described here is the workings of the first generation blockchain which functions largely just as a database. But the technology is evolving to become much more than this as the second generation already provides the capacity to execute any computer code on the blockchain. The system is evolving to become a globally distributed cloud computing infrastructure. But as we will discuss in a future module it remains very much a work in progress when seen from this perspective.

**Distributed Ledger**

Blockchain technology works to create a permanent and secure database, this makes blockchains suitable for the storage of a record or transaction that involves value or in some way needs to be a secure and trusted source of information. These secure distributed records are called distributed ledgers. A distributed ledger is a consensus of replicated, shared, and synchronized digital data geographically spread across multiple sites, countries, or institutions without central administrator or centralized data storage, being maintained by a distributed network of computers.

Such ledgers can be used for any form of asset registry, inventory, or monetary transaction. This might include the recording of hard assets such as physical property, cars, homes etc. or intangible assets such as currencies, patents, votes, identity, health data and many other forms of information.

This distributed ledger technology enables us to replace a multiplicity of private databases within each organization with one shared database that is trusted and accessible by all parties concerned. In this respect the blockchain enables trust between parties that may otherwise not trust each other, the result greatly strengthening our capacity for collaboration between organizations and individuals peer-to-peer without dependency on third-party centralized institutions. Likewise, they result in transparency and many other efficiencies.

This is of major significance as we currently have many centralized organizations that may be internally optimized and efficient but the inter-organizational space in between them is really inefficient with huge amounts of border friction, redundancy, arbitrage and resources wasted on competition, by enabling trusted inter-organizational networks these ledgers enable the formation of organization and collaboration where previously there was none, such as across whole supply chains, for different health care providers to collaborate around the patients needs or for different transport providers to coordinate in delivering an integrated logistics solution.

Likewise, the blockchain offers the possibility to automate the workings of these networks via what are called smart contracts. Smart contracts are computer code that is stored inside of a blockchain which encodes contractual agreements. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement or operation directly written into lines of code which are stored and executed on the blockchain. Like normal computer programs, these containers hold algorithms that take an input of data and depending on the value of the input trigger certain events. For example, this might be a financial contract that takes as the input the amount of money in a person's account if it is above a certain level then it increases the interest rate they earn on the deposit. Such smart contracts can be used for automating many basic operations on the network once again working to remove the need for intermediary third-party institutions, as smart contracts can be trusted, are tamper proof and execute automatically.

**Token Economies**

Much of the current discussion surrounding blockchain remains at the level of the technology and the possibilities of distributed ledgers as a shared trusted database enabling the collaboration between organizations with the resulting disintermediation of centralized institutions like banks and exchanges. However its implications go far beyond this as the blockchain concept is more than just a database or ledger; it is a new organizing paradigm for the discovery, valuation, and transfer of all discrete units of value and the development of distributed organizations via token markets systems.

A token is a quantified unit of value that is recorded on the blockchain, this value may be of any kind, it might be likes on social media, it might be a currency, it might be the integrity of an ecosystem or an electrical unit. Token economies consist of a network of independent nodes that act autonomously, but through incentive structures and the signaling systems of the market self-organize to create emergent coordination and thus a distributed management system.

For example, we might have a clean air token, where anyone who provides a service that contributes to the maintenance and provision of clean air can earn tokens - by say planting trees - while those who pollute - by say operating a combustion engine - pay in air tokens. Thus instead of having a central authority and a clean air act, we have a token market that works to create signals that align people's incentives with maintaining and growing the underlying resource.

Likewise, this same model can be applied to the management of technology infrastructure. Asexample we can think of traffic control, we currently have traffic control systems in cities whose operations are monitored and optimized by a centralized control center. But in a world of autonomous vehicles and the blockchain cars could signal to each other peer-to-peer bidding tokens to see who gets priority. In such a way the system has dynamically allocated resources and self-organized via the distributed token network.

In short, it is not just an information technology but also an institutional technology in that it enables us to design incentive structures in the form of token economies and in such a way convert centralized organizations into distributed markets vai token economics. This is where things get complex as we move into the realm of designing economies and incentive systems for coordinating human activity in a decentralized fashion, something that could potentially enable the coordination of all human activity at a much larger scale than has been possible before.

**Organization**
The great design innovation of the blockchain is really its capacity to coordinate a network of autonomous nodes towards maintaining a shared infrastructure and this is done not just through innovations in information technology but also through the design of incentive systems which is traditionally been the domain of economics. Through adding a layer of trust and value exchange to the internet the blockchain merges our newly developed information networks with the institutional structures that sit on top of them in so doing it greatly strengthens the capacity of those networks as a new mode for organizing society and economy.

By merging economics and technology it enables us to redesign institutional structures and ultimately reconceptualized how we organize virtually every aspect of our society, economy and even technology infrastructure based on networks of autonomous nodes that are incentivized to collaborate.

Of course, it does not do this alone such claims can be only realized in combination with other technologies and broader processes of change. As such the blockchain has to be understood in the context of a broader set of technological transformations taking place with the evolution of the internet. Most notably much of what the blockchain promises will only be possible given parallel developments in the Internet of Things, datafication, and advanced analytics, all of which are combining to form the next generation of the internet of which the blockchain will form the critical infrastructure.

**Blockchain Technology Overview**

In this video, we are going to talk about the basics of blockchain as a technology. On its most basic level, the blockchain can be understood as a new kind of database, at least this is its original design. What is different about this database is that it is distributed. Digital databases have been around for awhile now but until recently they have been designed to centralize information on one computer or within one organization. The blockchain though uses a distributed network of computers to maintain a shared database.

The blockchain is then a set of protocols and cryptographic methods that enable a network of computers to work together to securely record data within a shared open database. This database consists of a series of encrypted blocks that contain the data. The blockchain is a continuously growing list of these blocks of data which are linked and secured using cryptography, this makes it a trusted database with this trust being maintained by open source computer code and encryption instead of any institution.

The database stores information in blocks that are linked together through hash values, with entries to this database being made by computers that all have a copy of the database and must all come to a consensus about its state before they can update it. So there are three central concepts to understand the system workings, that of blocks and hashing, mining and proof of work and distributed consensus, we will go over each of these separately.

**Blocks**
Structurally speaking, a blockchain may be considered as a series of blocks of data that are securely chained together. New blocks are formed whenever participants create a piece of new data or wish to update existing data. These blocks are encrypted and given a hash value that is a unique identifier of their content. This hashing works by a standard algorithm being run over the block's data to compress it into a code, called the hash, that is unique to that document. No matter how large the file or what information it contains it is compressed into a 64-character secure hash. The hash can be recalculated from the underlying file, confirming that the original contents have not changed but the reverse is not possible, given just the hash value you cannot recreate the block's data content which is encrypted.

All blocks newly formed after the first block are securely chained to the previous one, meaning that the hash value of the next block in the chain is dependent upon the previous one. Thus once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered afterward without the alteration of all subsequent blocks. As well as this hash pointer linking to the previous block each block typically contains as well a timestamp so that we know what happened and when it happened. This hashing and linking of blocks makes them inherently resistant to modification of their data, making them immutable, you can only write data to the database and once it is there it is very hard to change, almost impossible. Data stored on the blockchain is generally considered incorruptible.

Blockchain security methods include the use of public-key cryptography. A public key which is a long, random-looking string of numbers, is an address on the blockchain. Value tokens sent across the network are recorded as belonging to that address. A private key is like a password that gives its owner access to their digital assets or the means to otherwise interact with that data. A public key is associated with the private key so that anyone can make an encrypted transaction to the public key address but that encrypted message can only be decrypted with the receiver's private key. In such a way effective security only requires keeping the private key private; the public key can be openly distributed without compromising security. For example on the bitcoin blockchain to receive funds from another person you use a piece of software called a wallet which creates a public key that you give to someone else for them to send bitcoins to that address, with your private key you can then access that address with those bitcoins on it.

**Consensus**
The blockchain is a distributed system, meaning there is no centralized organization to maintain and verify the entries on the database. This database instead is maintained by a large number of computers that are incentivized to provide computing resources by earning some form of tokens in exchange but these nodes themselves cannot be trusted individually. Thus it is required that the system provide a mechanism for creating consensus between scattered or distributed parties that do not need to trust each other but just need to trust the mechanism by which their consensus has arrived.

Any computer connected to the blockchain network using a client can perform the task of validating and relaying transactions. Each of these miner computers gets a copy of the blockchain, which gets downloaded automatically upon joining the network. When new entries into the database are made these changes are automatically broadcast across the network.

**Proof of Work**
Mining nodes validate transactions, add them to the block they are building, and then broadcast the completed block to other nodes on the network. In order to randomize the processing of blocks across the nodes and deter certain service abuses, blockchains use various time-stamping schemes, such as proof-of-work. Proof of work describes a system that requires a not-insignificant but feasible amount of effort usually by requiring computer processing time.

As in the case of the bitcoin blockchain, this is realized on some form of challenge such that no one actor on the network is able to solve this challenge consistently more than everyone else on the network. Miners compete to add the next block in the chain by racing to solve a very difficult cryptographic puzzle. The first to solve the puzzle, wins the lottery. As a reward for his or her efforts, the miner receives a small amount of newly created bitcoins and a small transaction fee. A consensus algorithm, like bitcoin's proof of work, works to ensure that the next block in a blockchain is the one and only version of the truth, and it keeps powerful adversaries from derailing the system.

**Features**
Blockchains are trying to create a secured, trusted, shared database and they do this through encryption and hashing, proof of work and network consensus. The hashing and linking of blocks makes it difficult to go back and change a previous block once entered, but this alone would not be sufficed to ensured that it is tamper proof so the proof of work system intentionally makes it computationally more difficult to alter the database, thus making it extremely difficult to alter all the blocks. On top of this it places a distributed consensus mechanism so that even if someone did manage to do this, their database would not match that of others and thus would not be accepted as the valid record.

So to successfully tamper with a blockchain you would need to alter all the blocks on the chain, redo the proof of work for each block and take control of more than 50% of the peer-to-peer network, only then will your altered block becomeaccepted by everyone else. On a blockchain of almost any size, this would be almost impossible to do. Indeed the bitcoin blockchain is a very good proof of this given that it now secure hundreds of billions of dollars using this method without the network having been hacked.

At the end of the day what this technology enables is a database that is secure with automatic trust that is enabled by open source code and encryption. It is tamper proof, once information is put into the database it can not be altered. It is a shared database as many people across a network have a copy which is continuously being updated so that all have a single source of truth. Likewise, it is transparent, meaning everyone can see all the transactions and alterations made to the database if needed. Data quality and the resilience of the network is maintained by massive database replication across many different nodes on the network, no centralized "official" copy exists and no user is "trusted" more than any other.

Having started out life as simply a mechanism to enable bitcoin it has become increasingly recognized that this system is secure enough to work as a ledger for the recording and exchange of any value what we now call a distributed ledger.

**Evolution of Blockchain**

In the previous video we talked about the basic workings of the original blockchain concept, but over the past years it has been evolving fast, from the original Bitcoin protocol to the second generation Ethereum platform, to today where we are in the process of building what some call blockchain 3.0 In this evolution we can see how the technology is evolving from its initial form as essentially just a database, to becoming a fully fledged globally distributed cloud computer. In this module, we are going to trace the past present and future of blockchain technology.

**First Generation** 
The first blockchain was conceptualized in 2008 by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. The concept and technicalities are described in an accessible white paper, termed “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” These ideas were then first implemented in 2009 as a core component supporting bitcoin where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions.

The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server. It was only later that we came to really separate the concept of the blockchain from that of its specific implementation as a currency in bitcoin. We came to see that the underlying technology had a more general application beyond digital currencies in its capacity to function as a distributed ledger tracking and recording the exchange of any form of value. The bitcoin design has been the inspiration for other applications and has played an important role as a relatively large scale proof of concept.

**Second Generation** 
Within a few years, the second generation of blockchain emerged designed as a network on which developers could build applications; essentially the beginnings of its evolution into a distributed virtual computer. This was made technically possible by the development of the Ethereum platform. Ethereum is an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform featuring smart contract functionality. It provides a decentralized Turing-complete virtual machine, which can execute computer programs using a global network of nodes.

Ethereum was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin, in late 2013 with a goal of building decentralized applications. The system went live on 30 July 2015 and has been very successful attracting a large and dedicated community of developers, supporters, and enterprises. The important contribution of Ethereum as the second generation of blockchains is that it worked to extend the capacity of the technology from primarily being a database supporting bitcoin to becoming more of a general platform for running decentralized applications and smart contracts, both of which we will discuss more in coming modules.

As of 2018 Ethereum is the largest and most popular platform for building distributed applications on, many different types of applications have been built on it, from social networks to identity systems to prediction markets and many types of financial applications.

Ethereum has been a major step forward and with its advent it has become ever more apparent where we are heading with the technology, which is the development of a globally distributed computer, a massive globally distributed cloud computing platform upon which we can run any application at scale and speed, with the assurance that it has the security, resilience, and trustworthiness of today's blockchains.

However the existing solutions that we have are like extremely inefficient computers, the existing blockchain infrastructure is like a really bad computer that is not able to do much except proofs of concepts. Getting to the next level remains still a huge challenge that involves some original and difficult computer science, game theory and mathematical challenges. Scalability remains at the heart of the current stage in the journey that we are on and this is what the third generation of blockchain technologies are trying to solve.

**Current Constraints** 
The mining required to support the Bitcoin network currently consumes more energy than many small nations being equal to that of Denmark and costing over 1.5 billion dollars a year in electricity. A Lot of this is being fueled by cheap but dirty coal energy in China where almost 60% of the mining is currently being done. This high energy consumption is simply not scalable to a mass adoption.

Ethereum and bitcoin use a combination of technical tricks and incentives to ensure that they accurately record who owns what without a central authority. The problem is, it’s difficult to preserve this balance while also growing the number of users. Current Blockchains require global consensus on the order and outcome of all transfers. In Ethereum all smart contracts are stored publicly on every node of the blockchain, which has trade-offs. The downside is that performance issues arise in that every node is calculating all the smart contracts in real time, resulting in lower speeds. This is clearly a cumbersome task, especially since the total number of transactions is increasing approximately every 10–12 seconds with each new block.

The volume of transactions is likewise an existing constraint. With cryptocurrency, speed is measured by TPS transaction per second. The bitcoin network theoretical maximum capacity is up to 7 transactions per second while the Ethereum blockchain as of early 2018 can handle about 15 transactions per second. By comparison Visa's network is capable of handling more than 24,000 transactions per second, similarly, Facebook may have about 900,000 users on the site in any given minute meaning that it handles about 175,000 requests per second.

Another issue is that of cost, the fact that it cost some small amount to run the network so as to pay the minors for maintaining the ledger. What we have is OK for a limited number of large transactions such as sending money, but making a small transaction like purchasing a coffee could not be done by most blockchains. They simply cannot in their existing form deal with a very large amount of micro-transactions such as would be required to enable high volume machine to machine exchanges, it would prove too expensive to operate these kinds of economies that involve many small exchanges.

**Third Generation** 
In response to these constraints, a third generation of blockchain networks are currently under development. Many different organizations are currently working on building this next generation blockchain infrastructure such as Dfinity, NEO, EOS, IOTA and Etherium itself and they each use different approaches to try and overcome the current constraints. Going into the details of how these different networks work is a bit advanced for this course so we will just give a very brief overview.
.
Lightning Network is a project that seeks to extend the capacities of existing blockchains. The main idea is that small and nonsignificant transactions don't have to be stored on the main blockchain. This is called an "off chain" approach because small transactions happen off of the main blockchain. It works by creating small communities wherein transactions can take place without those being registered on the main blockchain. A payment channel is opened between a group of people with the funds being frozen on the main blockchain, those members can then transact with each other using their private keys to validate transactions. This is a bit like having a tab with a shop, where you just mark down what you have exchanged so that you don't have to update the main record in the bank each time you make a purchase, the record stays local before at some time setting the finances and updating the main bank records.

This only requires two transactions on the main blockchain, one to open the transaction channel and one to close its, all other transactions happen just within that network without it being registered on the main blockchain. This both reduces the workload on the main blockchain and makes it possible to have a very many very fast transactions within the subnetwork. As of the start of 2018, there is a proof-of-concept running live on the bitcoin testnet but the system will not be fully operational until later in the year.

IOTA is another example. Whereas existing blockchains are sequential chains where blocks are added in regular linear chronological order the IOTA data structure is able to achieve high transaction throughput by parallelizing validation, the data structure is more like a network rather than a linear chain wherein processing can take place alongside each other.

The other big difference is that there are not specialized minors in this network, every node that uses the network functions as a minor, in the IOTA network every node making a transaction also actively participates in forming the consensus, that is to say, doing the mining. This means there is no centralization of mining within the network which is what creates bottlenecks and uses lots of energy, likewise, there are no transaction fees for validation and with IOTA because it is more user-generated the more people that use the network the faster it becomes, which is the opposite of existing systems.

**Conclusion** 
There are lots of other possible approaches but suffice to say that blockchain should be understood as an emerging technology whose existing implementation is like a large-scale proof of concept running on a very inefficient system, but through lots of experimentation and iteration will hopefully in the coming years evolve into this globally distributed computer.

As Melanie Swan writes in her book Blockchain a blueprint for a new economy "First, there were the mainframe and PC (personal computer) paradigms, and then the Internet revolutionized everything. Mobile and social networking was the most recent paradigm. The current emerging paradigm for this decade could be the connected world of computing relying on blockchain cryptography."

To understand this better in the next section we are going to talk about the blockchain in the context of the broader technological changes that are currently underway as we built the next generation of the internet, what we call the decentralized web or web 3.0 How we understand the blockchain and where we are with ittoday is extremely transitory, in this respect what we are talking about in this course when we talk about the blockchain is really this emerging IT infrastructure for a distributed global cloud computer, the next generation of blockchain will just take us a step further on that journey.

What we call the blockchain today is really just a very limited and often very inefficient version of this, we still have many very difficult problems to solve before we get there. Possibly that end state will look something like the blockchain of today but possibly it will look very different.

**Decentralized Web**

We have talked in previous videos about blockchain technology and its evolution, but its true significance and potential can only really be understood in the context of broader technological changes brought about in the ongoing evolution of the internet and information technology.

People will make many big claims about the potential for the blockchain to revolutionize the foundations of social and economic organization, but the blockchain can only have such potential as part of a broader ecosystem of technologies that are emerging as the next generation of the web, what may be called web 3.0 or the decentralized web.

Today powerful new technologies are coalescing to take us into a new technological paradigm, these include the rise of advanced analytics coupled with datafication and the Internet of Things, the blockchain will have to work synergistically with these if its true capacities are to be realized. But to understand this next generation web we need to understand a bit about its history.

Going back to the early nineties the Web 1.0 was the first generation of the World Wide Web, it was based on the technology of HTTP which worked to link documents on different computers and make them accessible over the internet. HTML was then used to display those documents so that any connected computer with a browser could access and read a web page. Web 1 was all about information as it enabled us to exchange information much more efficiently, and hence it got the name "information superhighway." Even though it was a revolution in information exchange, content creators were few with the vast majority of users simply acting as consumers of content, it was very static and lacked interactivity.

Whereas in the Web 1.0-era people were limited to the passive viewing of content, with Web 2.0 websites allowed users to interact, collaborate and become the creators of content. With Web 2 people could not only read from the web but also write to it and thus it got the nickname of "the read-write web". By the early 2000s, new server-side scripting technology such as PHP enabled developers to easily build applications where people could write information to a database with that information then being dynamically updated every time they refreshed the page. Almost all of the websites that dominate the web today are based on this basic technology, it gave us social networking, blogging, video sharing, eBay, Youtube, Facebook and all the other large platforms that most people spend most of their internet time using.

The idea of web 3.0 has been around for awhile but it is only very recently with the developments of the blockchain that it has actually started to become something real.
Web 2.0 has evolved to become highly centralized around very large platforms running out of ever-larger data centers, creating many issues surrounding, security, privacy, control and concentration of power in the hands of large enterprises, it is only today that these issues are starting to enter mainstream discourse. Web 3 is set to disrupt this whole technology paradigm as the critical change that is coming about is that we are decentralizing the Web.

The blockchain provides the protocols and cryptography for a globally distributed network of computers to collaborate on maintaining a publicly secure database and with a virtual machine like Ethereum, we can run code on this creating a new set of distributed applications.These new technologies of the blockchain, IPFS and the distributed web enable us to reconfigure the internet into a distributed global computer so that we are no longer dependent upon the web platforms and data centers of web 2 to run the internet but can now build and run applications on this shared global computer.

As Mike Liebhold of the Institute for the Future noted "[It] starts with the realization that the internet that we know today is only one possible interpretation of the original vision of an open peer-to-peer network independent of any centralized technology commercial entity, or sovereign government, think of it as a first curve internet, one that is increasingly vulnerable to abuse and even collapse."

To date we have largely taken the infrastructure of the internet for granted, all of the innovation and action has been focused on the application layer, on web applications like social networks or e-commerce. With the developments of blockchain and particularly with the third generation we are starting to innovate on the lower level protocols, asking not if we can build a better web app but if we can build a better internet.

The implications of the decentralized web are indeed radical in that it enables us to create automated services, disintermediate existing incumbents and enable people to set up their own secure networks of exchange empowering them in new ways.

The blockchain will be a core part of web 3.0 but the next generation internet will also see the convergence of the Internet of Things and big data analytics.

The ongoing fundamental process of datafication will be a key aspect of this next generation internet. As we increasingly instrument our world data will flow from all sources about everything. Datafication is the term given to our newfound ability to capture as data many aspects of the world and our lives that have never been quantified before. This process results in what is called big data, vast amounts of unstructured data that can be mined by advanced analytical methods to gain new insight into the world around us.

This is important with respect to the blockchain because firstly it means we will have a lot of sensitive personal data that we will want to store. Secondly, we will be quantifying, accounting for and exchanging all sorts of value that we did not in the past.
Thirdly such a diversity of sources of data combined with advanced analytics which can find cross-correlations and patterns within it can provide a new way to verify the data that is being inputted into the blockchain without depending on centralized authorities for validation.

The next generation internet will be much smarter. Whereas web 1 was dumb and web 2 was dynamic, web 3 will incorporate various aspects of machine learning and cognitive computing as-a-service as it becomes infused into almost all applications making it truly adaptive, responsive and personalized.

Whereas web 1 and 2 were largely about people exchanging information, in web 3 machines will come online and the internet will become something more physical as billions of devices and actuators connect it to all sorts of things - from tractors to factories and drones - enabling them to interact and coordinate, machine-to-machine.

The value of IoT will not be in making one device or system smart it will be in enabling seamless processes across systems, this will require open networks that can communicate and coordinate components on demand across domains, organizations, and systems.
The end vision of IoT is not to have our lives populated with thousands of smart things, but instead to change our world from discrete things to service processes.

To do this these technologies will have to communicate securely peer-to-peer, dynamically allocating resources and this will require some kind of distributed secure infrastructure like the blockchain. This ties in with the broader process of change which comes about as we move into a services economy called servicization which is the shift from products and the ownership of things to the access of services on demand, for example instead of owning a car we simply have access to a car-sharing service. This economy of temporary usage via services requires the formation of frictionless markets and automatic exchanges that the blockchain is well suited to support.

These components of the next generation internet, the blockchain, internet of things and advanced analytics are very powerful technologies that will have a profound effect on society. They will take us much further into this new world of the information age as power shifts in a radical way from people in hierarchical institutions to automated networks and the algorithms that coordinate them.

In the coming decades more and more of our systems of organization will move to the internet and it will become vastly more complex than today. In Web 1 and Web 2, we developed the internet from small to large through a client-server architecture that worked to centralized the web around large data centers. But the internet after datafication and all these IoT devices have come online will not be large, it will be more like infinite. You can get from small to large by centralizing, but you get from large to infinite through distributing.

**Distributed Organization**

So far in the course, we have been largely talking about blockchain as a technology, but technologies are just tools that enable us to do things, the interesting part of the blockchain is really what it enables in terms of new forms of distributed organization. As one commentator noted "blockchain is an institutional technology, not an information technology, there is an enormous difference between the two. Institutional revolutions are things that don't happen very often."

Blockchain technology enables new forms of networked distributed organizations, something that runs very much contrary to our existing organizational paradigm and that is what makes it difficult for us to understand. The organizational model of the industrial age that we inherit today was one of centralization in order to achieve economies of scale through mass production thus reducing unit cost and provide for a mass society.

The technologies of the industrial age selectively favored centralization of production within closed hierarchical organizations. Manufacturing is centralized in factories, transport systems are centralized around transport hubs, education within schools and universities, entertainment centralized within mass media organizations and governance centralized within state-run organizations and so on.

The information revolution is in the process of taking us into a new world of distributed networks as the organizational paradigm of the information age. The combination of telecommunication networks and computerized coordination enables us to replace centralized management within closed hierarchies with open networks. As the underlying technology matures we are able to convert more and more systems that were previously closed and centralized and have them manage through automated networks.

We saw this with the rise of online platforms like eBay, Uber or Alibaba, social networks, and blogging etc. that built massive networks of users exchanging goods and services peer to peer. But these platforms were still dependent upon the centralized organization to manage the shared database, the computing infrastructure, the algorithms and to enable trust within the network. The decentralized web takes these platforms a step further by offering a shared open database that can be trusted by all parties and a set of protocols for the secure exchange of value between organizations.

The web platforms are open networks this means they do not just optimize within a given organization but can enable coordination across whole industries, indeed this is why and how they come to supplant the closed organization. What centralized organization enabled was trust and coordination and cooperation within organizations, but what the blockchain enables is trust, coordination and cooperation between organizations and between individuals peer-to-peer.

If we look at how our society and economy is currently organized we will see many closed organizations that are internally optimized, but when we look at the inter-organizational space it is extremely inefficient. For example, if we look at the way businesses coordinate along a supply chain, or the way nation-states interoperate in the global political system we will see there are huge redundancy and frictions caused by discontinuities. A classic example of this is the border system between nations and the bureaucratic procedures for obtaining a visa for moving from one nation to another which creates a massive amount of friction at the inter-organizational space. This greatly reduces the overall effectiveness of these systems and the delivered outcome for the end user. When we look internal to these organizations they look like efficient well-oiled machines, but when we look in between them the whole system is very inefficient.

This is part of the significance of blockchain becauseit provides a shared trusted database between organizations it has the potential to switch the dynamics within economy and society from competition between closed centralized organizations to collaboration between organizations and greatly strengthen work capacities across organizational boundaries the result of this would be much more efficient overall societal and economic outcomes.

Indeed we can note that achieving coordination across organizations could result in quantum leaps in delivered outcomes and our capacity to tackle major global challenges of today such as environmental degradation where week existing inter-organizational institutional infrastructure has made little traction. In this respect, blockchain has the potential to give us not just incremental improvements but an order of magnitude greater capacities within society through collaboration within whole ecosystems.

It is precisely this coordination across organizations, industries, nations and peoples that is required to provide the resources needed to tackle some of today's most complex challenges and it is precisely this that is significantly absent with existing institutional structures.

Because of the centralizing forces prevalent in the Industrial Age we live in societies that are operated by many different closed organizations, many different companies all producing cars and competing for market share, many different governments that all focus on the interest of their own citizens over those of others, many different healthcare providers, transport providers etc. The result of this is though a huge amount of inefficiency and redundancy when taken as a whole, many different companies all recreating the wheel within their own organizations and expending a huge amount of time and energy on trying to get ahead of their peers.

We assume this is the normal state of operation but in fact, it is just a function of the institutional structures we have built over the past centuries. As game theory will tell us people respond to incentives and the socioeconomic forces acting on them, in the absence of cooperative structures competition is often the optimal strategy for individuals and organizations, but once there is the institutional structure to enable trust and coordination between members cooperation can become a much more viable strategy for agents involved.

Because the blockchain enables this shared database it makes it greatly more possible and viable for organizations to collaborate on a single solution or single source and achieve much better results for each organization and economy as a whole.

As an example of this cooperation across different closed organizations, we could think about the design and construction of a building, there may be many different companies involved in this process all creating their own design and diagrams for the building with each then having to continuously contact each other to access and exchange and cross-reference them. Given a shared database they could all collaborate on a single design of the building making for a greatly more efficient overall process each organization benefits and the overall results are more efficient.

Likewise the same is true for identity, we currently have many different copies of our identity spread across many different organizations, governments, social networks, employees etc. each with only a partial understanding of us, currently we are recreating the wheel for each organization while data and reputation do not move well between them. Instead, a single identity could be created on the blockchain that belongs to the individual with each organization then contributing to this database as they are working together to create a more complete record of identity and reputation. In so doing we have moved from all those frictions between these closed organizations to collaboration and synergies between them creating something that is greater than any of the parts they had before.

The same is true for a supply chain instead of each participant holding their owndocuments and records during each stage in the supply chain a single record for the item could be created on the blockchain with each organization then contributing their information to it to create a single source of truth that is accessible to all as needed. The end result of this new institutional technology is a much greater capacity for inter-organizational collaboration and powerful ecosystems that are greater than the sum of their parts.

Given that all of our current systems of organization that are centralized could be decentralized in this fashion using blockchain technology we can see how it really could enable a reorganizing of society and economy. Organisations within society rarely operate in isolation, they function as part of ecosystems and the value for society is not created by anyone but instead by the flow of value across the ecosystem. Whereas our previous institutional structures optimized for individual organizations the blockchain optimizes for the value within the whole ecosystem and thus much greater value for society as a whole.

The information revolution is changing the world from disconnected to connected. The hyperconnectivity genie is out of the bottle and connectivity along almost all dimensions is proliferating daily. As a consequence, our systems of organization will change from being based on fixed structures and boundaries to being coordinated via connections. Instead of the control of components through fixed hierarchical structures, organization will emerge out of interaction and the exchange of value along those interactions. Enabling that will require a massive build out of secure frictionless information networks, this global cloud computer of the blockchain. To understand better how this shared database that enables inter-organizational collaboration works we will talk about distributed ledger technology in the coming video

**Distributed Ledgers**

As we have been talking about the blockchain is like another layer to the Internet that enables secure, trusted records and transactions to take place peer-to-peer between people who may not otherwise trust each other; the trust is in the technology, computer code, and mathematics rather than people and centralized institutions. In this respect, people sometimes talk about the blockchain as a "trusted machine" in its capacity to enable a network where trust is created by design. Because the blockchain creates a trusted database it can function as a record of value storage and exchange, these records of value may be called ledgers.

Since ancient times, ledgers have formed the backbone of our economies – to record contracts and payments, for buying and selling of goods, or the exchange of assets like property. These ledgers started out as records in stone, clay tablets, and papyrus and later paper as they evolved into the ledger books supporting modern accounting. They enabled the formation of currencies, trade, lending and the evolution of banking.

Over the last couple of decades though, these records have moved into the digital realm as whole rooms of people working to maintain accounts have become replaced by digital computers which have made possible our complex global economic system. Today, this record keeping system is once again being revolutionized as these ledgers are shifting to a global network of computers which is cryptographically secured, fast and decentralized, what we call a distributed ledger or distributed ledger technology DLT for short.

A distributed ledger can be described as a ledger of any transactions or contracts supported by a decentralized network from across different locations and people, eliminating the need for a central authority. All the information on it is securely and accurately stored using cryptography and can be accessed using keys and cryptographic signatures. Any changes or additions made to the ledger are reflected and copied to all participants in a matter of seconds or minutes.

The participant at each node of the network can access the recordings shared across that network and can own an identical copy of it. At the same time, these networks make constantly available for examination a full audit trail of information history, which can be traced back to the moment when a piece of information was created and every participant in the network can get simultaneous access to a common view of the information.

These ledgers can be used for the recording, tracking, monitoring, and transacting of all forms of assets, all asset registries, inventories, and exchanges, including every area of economics, finance, and money; physical assets such as cars and houses; and intangible assets such as votes, ideas, health data, reputation etc.

In this case, the blockchain can serve as the public records repository for whole societies, including the registry of all documents, events, identities, and assets. In this system, all property could become smart property; this is the notion of encoding every asset to the blockchain with a unique identifier such that the asset can be tracked, controlled, and exchanged on the blockchain. For example distributed ledgers could be used to replace or supplement all existing intellectual property management systems as they can register the exact contents of any digital asset such as a file, image, health record or code, to the ledger and given a unique identifier in the form of a hash value.

**Permission**

There are two main classes of distributed ledger: public and permissioned. The former type is maintained by public nodes and is accessible to anyone. Bitcoin is a well-known example of a public platform where anyone can read the chain, anyone can make legitimate changes and anyone can write a new block into the chain. Ripple is an example of a permissioned blockchain, where the creators of the network determine who may act as transaction validators on their network. DLT platforms in each category have their own unique features. Some are designed for specific types of applications, and others for general use. For instance, in the Corda DLT platform, which is a consortium of more than 70 of the world's biggest financial institutions, the sharing of individual ledger data is limited to parties with a legitimate need to know, which is not the case on other platforms.

**Disintermediation**

DLT technology can have a powerful disintermediation effect as data can be put directly onto the shared database by the network there is no longer need for a centralized organization to provide this service. A developer can create a DLT on a blockchain and using public-private key encryption give people secure storage space on that ledger, allowing people to own their own data, which creates a very different scenario to the world of today.

Currently, centralized organizations like Google and Facebook suck up all the little bits of data we leave behind us and use it to serve us customized advertisements from which they create their revenue. This results in a huge power imbalance within society where centralized organizations armed with teams of mathematicians and computer scientists use mountains of data to influence people's behavior towards purchasing the products of their advertisers. Data, that is a very valuable asset in an information society and of critical importance to tackling major societal challenges, is being used against us in many ways, creating a stumbling block that societies are becoming increasingly aware of.

In a world of distributed ledgers, people have their own little databases on the blockchain and can own their own data giving it to organizations to use when and where needed; fundamentally reversing the current dynamic and empowering people. Your health records reside in your health ledger and different healthcare providers can access and update that single record but only with the permission of the end user as the data remains theirs.

Likewise, when people own their own database on a distributed ledger they can transact directly peer to peer, as is the case with Bitcoin. With the existing traditional system when you pay for a ride in a taxi with a credit card, it looks like you are paying the driver directly, when in fact what is happening is that a database record belonging to my bank is being debited and a database belonging to the bank of the company the driver works for is being created.

In this respect we can note that in our society, value and data don't really belong to individuals, all the time they are behind the walls of some centralized organization and we are dependent upon them to secure and validate it, creating huge power imbalances within society. In contrast with the Bitcoin blockchain, the individual has a ledger record and a secret key with which they can access their record. When they send money they send it directly to the other person's record, simply debiting from your record and adding to theirs directly peer-to-peer.

**Transparency**

Distributed ledger technology can greatly improve transparency, reduce corruption and improve security while reducing overhead cost of auditing, accounting, and legal issues. Currently records of value are hidden within the databases of centralized organizations where they are largely inaccessible for their many possible uses within other systems; they are open to manipulation by members within those organizations, which breeds corruption, and because of that there has to be all sorts of regulation and legal requirements that create many overhead costs. Added to this they are centralized points of failure for critical data sources as large concentrations of valuable data prove very attractive to malicious actors. Likewise, it is inefficient to be continuously updating and synchronizing data across many centralized databases.

By putting the information on a shared ledger it can be easily made accessible and visible on demand as needed, because it is tamper proof it can remove many existing points of corruption and the associated need for regulation. Likewise, it is secured by a distributed network without a single point of failure and continuously synchronized across all notes to create a single source of truth for all users.

**Smart Contracts**

One of the key technological innovations of blockchain 2.0 has been the development of what are called smart contracts. Smart contracts are computer code that are stored inside of a blockchain which encodes contractual agreements. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement or operation directly written into lines of code which are stored and executed on the blockchain computer.

A contract in the traditional sense is a binding agreement between two or more parties to do or not do something. Each party must trust the other party to fulfill its side of the obligation. They are a written or spoken agreement that is intended to be enforceable by law.

A myriad of different contractual agreements form the institutional foundations to our society and economy which have evolved since ancient times. If we think about something as seemingly simple as a cafe serving a cup of coffee, we will see that it is really enabled by a massive amount of contracts between different parties that enable them to cooperate in delivering the outcome. Contracts between employees and employer of the coffee shop, contracts that provide workers with health cover, contracts that ensure the coffee shop, contracts between suppliers along the supply chain, contracts between property owner and tenant etc.

Our economies are powered by a massively complex set of contractual agreements that are currently created and enforced by centralized organizations like insurance companies and banks which are supported by the ultimate centralized authority, the nation-state system. Our societies and economies are almost completely dependent upon centralized third-party organizations to maintain and enforce these contractual agreements.

Smart contracts feature the same kind of agreement to act or not act, but they remove the need for the trusted third party between members of the contract. This is because a smart contract is both defined by the computer code and executed or enforced by the code itself, automatically without discretion. As such blockchains and smart contract technology can remove the reliance on centralized systems and enable people to create their own contractual agreements that can be automatically enforced and executed by code.

Smart contracts are decentralized in that they do not subsist on a single centralized server; they are distributed and self-executing across network nodes. This means that untrusted parties can transact with each other in a much more fluid fashion without depending upon third parties to initiate and maintain the rules of the transaction. Likewise, smart contracts enable autonomy between members, meaning that after it is launched and running, a contract and its initiating agents need not be in further contact.

One illustration of this concept is a vending machine. Unlike a person, a vending machine operates algorithmically; you provide the source input of money and product selection, which the machine takes as input and simply executes on a rule automatically to produce the output. The same instruction set will be followed every time in every case. When you deposit money and make a selection, the item is released. There is no possibility of the machine not wanting to or not feeling like complying with the contract, or only partially complying.

As another example, we can think about a situation where four different people pool their money to make a joint investment that will return interest. A smart contract could be programmed on the blockchain to take any interest that is created, divide it into four and send each amount to the corresponding wallets of the different stakeholders. A smart contract is then really just an account on the blockchain that is controlled by code instead of by a user. Because it is on the blockchain it is immutable meaning the code cannot be changed and thus all participants in the investment can be assured that they will get their share automatically. The code dictates how the processing will take place and no individual has the power to change it, no individual, no organization no government can censor, alter or manipulate it.

In this respect, it is often said that “code is law” in the sense that the code will execute no matter what. Of course, code has been for a while now acting as the law, for example as services have gone online we are increasingly faced with web forms that strictly control what inputs are allowed. If you want to buy an item on iTunes USA then you will have to have a credit card with a US address, the system will auto enforce this by not letting you complete the purchase with the incorrect address.

As another example, a logistics company could use smart contracts to execute code that says, if I receive cash on delivery at this location then trigger a supplier request to stock a new item since the existing item was just delivered.

**Smart Property**
A combination of smart contract with blockchain-encoded property gives us the idea of smart property. Smart property is simply property whose ownership is controlled via blockchain encoded contractual agreements. For example, a pre-established smart contract could automatically transfer the ownership of a vehicle title from the holding company to the individual owner when all the loan installments have been cleared. The key idea of smart property is controlling ownership and access to an asset by having it registered as a digital asset on the ledger and connecting it to a smart contract. In some cases, physical-world hard assets could quite literally be controlled with the blockchain.

One example of such an IoT Blockchain system is Slock.it a door lock that is connected to a smart contract on the blockchain which controls when and who can open the lock. This enables anyone to rent, sell or share their property without middleman. With such innovations, parking spots can be sublet on demand. Airbnb apartments could become fully automated or someone with 20 bikes in Bangladesh could rent them out, with smart contract locks the bike could shut itself off if it is not being paid for or if it is stolen there is an automatic deposit system or likewise if the person wanted they can simply pay a certain price to purchase the bike outright at anytime.

**Oracles**
Like all algorithms, smart contracts require input values and only act if certain predefined conditions are met. When a particular value is reached, the smart contract changes its state and executes the programmatically predefined algorithms, automatically triggering an event on the blockchain. Thus the workings of the overall contract can only be as good as the inputted data, if false data is inputted to the system them false results will be output.

Blockchains cannot access data outside their network and thus requires some form of trusted data feed as input to the system, what may be called an oracle. An oracle is a data feed, provided by an external service, and designed for use in smart contracts on the blockchain. Oracles provide external data and trigger smart contract executions when predefined conditions are met. Such conditions could be any data like weather temperature, the quantity of items in stock, a successful payment, changes in the prices on the stock market, etc.

An oracle, in the context of blockchains and smart contracts, is then an agent that finds and verifies real-world occurrences and provides this information to a blockchain to be used by smart contracts. Oracles are third party services which are not part of the blockchain consensus mechanism thus whether it be a news feed, website or a sensor, the source of information needs to be trustworthy.

As an example, we could think of an online betting platform based on the blockchain that uses smart contracts to automatically execute payouts to people who have placed bets on sports matches. The smart contract system would then have to be connected to a trusted oracle to provide it with the score of the matches. Currently, this oracle would likely have to be associated with some trusted third party centralized organization, like a sports channel or Bloomberg for stock prices. However in the future through datafication and IoT pervasive sensing, this might also be automated given the use of advanced analytics. Using automated oracles that draw data from a myriad of sources and complex analysis to find cross-correlations that provides a statistical assurance that for example an given event occurred or did not occur.

**Advantages & Limitations**
The advantages of smart contracts are numerous. Firstly they are automatic which could remove time and costs associated with managing and enforcing them; making them more efficient as they can be cheaper and faster to run. Through this form of automation, a much greater amount of exchange could take place that otherwise would never have happened. In such a way we can see how distributed ledger and smart contracts are a key part of enabling a service economy where ownership is displaced by temporary usage through the on-demand provisioning of services.

Second, they could reduce corruption, as the code is both transparent in its workings and automatically executed this leaves little room for a centralized organization to alter it to their advantage.

Thirdly they can reduce dependency upon centralized organizations as people may be able to set up there own contractual agreements peer-to-peer, thus limiting the arbitrary power of centralized organizations.

Lastly, they can also deliver certainty as smart contracts guarantee a very specific set of outcomes that are predetermined beforehand, enabling all parties to know exactly what will happen when.

But herein also lies some of their limitations, by automating the execution of a contract they are dependent upon formal rules with well-specified inputs and leave little room for a multiplicity of eventualities where the rules may need to be slightly altered because of unforeseen circumstances. For example, an on-demand car that operates through a smart contract will simply shut the user out if they have not paid the bill to use the car and may take little account of the fact that it may be a life or death emergency usage. In the real world, many unpredictable and unforeseen events do occur and rules sometimes need to be flexible and adapt to accommodate. This is one advantage of having human oversight as people are much more capable at judging such circumstances and responding appropriately to complex unforeseen eventualities.

So the degree to which we can automate contracts is relative to the kind of environment that is being operated in and in complex situations there will often need to be some form of governing body to intervene when needed and this creates new complications surrounding governance that are still yet to be figured out.

**Distributed Applications**

The advent of the Ethereum platform in 2015 has worked to provide a virtual computing infrastructure for running applications on the blockchain, this new form of program is called a distributed application or Dapp for short. Ethereum was the first developer platform for building distributed apps it is a foundational general-purpose blockchain based platform that is a Turing-complete virtual machine, meaning it can run any computer code. All though Ethereum was the first and still the largest platform for developing distributed applications there are now others such as Blockstack or EOS all of which provide the underlying infrastructure for building Dapps.

Our working definition of a Dapp is an application that runs on a network in a distributed fashion with participant information securely protected and operations executed in a decentralized fashion across a network of nodes. Dapps use open source code, operate autonomously with data and records cryptographically stored on a blockchain.

On a technical level, a Dapp is very much similar to a normal web application except unlike with a normal web app where the backend code is running on centralized servers a Dapp has its code running on a decentralized peer-to-peer network. A Dapp can have frontend code and user interfaces written in any language just like an app that can make calls to its backend. As such Dapps will often look and feel very much like regular apps and people will be using them in the coming decades without realizing it.

Like all apps dapps perform a specific function, whereas Bitcoin is a decentralized value exchange, a decentralized application aims to achieve functionality beyond transactions that merely exchange value. Many types of decentralized apps are starting to emerge as the underlying technology continues to progress.

Already we can seem many DAPPS that present alternatives to the existing popular web applications. Probably the most successful Dapp to date is Steemit. Steemit is a blogging and social networking website on top of the Steem blockchain database. The general concept is similar to other blogging websites or social news websites like Reddit, but the text content is saved in a blockchain. Using a blockchain enables rewarding comments and posts with secure tokens of value.

Likewise, for existing marketplace applications like eBay and Craigslist, we have the decentralized version Openbazaar. OpenBazaar is an open source project developing a protocol for e-commerce transactions in a fully decentralized marketplace. Because the application connects people directly via a peer to peer network it costs nothing to download and use. Unlike sites like eBay or Amazon, there are no fees to list items, and no fees when an item is sold. Openbazaar is not a company like eBay but an open source project, each user contributes to the network equally and is in control of their own store and private data.

Another example is Storj which is a decentralized cloud storage application like Dropbox. Storj is based on blockchain technology and peer-to-peer protocols to provide secure, private and efficient cloud storage. The application incentivizes storage providers and connects them with those who require it, each file saved on the application is shredded, encrypted and spread across the network until you are ready to use it again, the keys to the database remain withthe owners meaning the data is not accessible by a centralized cloud provider.

In short, dapps could be applied to many areas that require a secure record and benefit from decentralization. They are automated which means they can operate at very low or zero cost. Because of this dapps may be used to disrupt the existing platform economy as whole platforms like Uber or Airbnb maybe eventually converted into dapps that run automatically without the need for the central platform. The advantages of dapps is that they are fully automated have superior fault tolerance and trustless execution. These decentralized apps potentially represent the next generation of computing.

**The Internet of Value**

Because the blockchain is a secure system that enables a trusted network it may be described as a value-exchange protocol. In this respect, it is often said that what the Web did for the exchange of information the blockchain will do for the exchange of value. Just as the web revolutionized the use and exchange of information within society disrupting whole industries based upon the centralization of information, so to the blockchain is set to do the same for the recording and exchange of all forms of quantifiable value.

The idea of value lies at the heart of the blockchain, if there is no value involved in the process then there is no need for trust and no need to use a blockchain. The vision of the internet of value is for any quantum of value to be exchanged as quickly and fluidly as information is today. Although information moves around the world instantly, a single payment from one country to another is slow, expensive and unreliable often taking days and involving numerous intermediate third parties to validate and process transactions.

Thus it is no accident that the first widespread use of the blockchain was for currency because it is the most immediate and obvious source of quantified value within society. However to truly understand the revolutionary potential of this technology is to appreciate how value and its exchange influences and regulates almost all aspects of human affairs. As a consequence, the control of how value gets defined, measured and exchanged is a key source of power and control within society and has been since the origins of civilization.

Today value of almost all kind is defined, quantified and regulated by centralized organizations, whether this is a national government creating their own currencies or one's role within a hierarchy defining one's economic status or the branded clothing that people wear to signal to each other their social status and value.

However, the move into the network society shifts the locus of organization from closed institutions to individuals and networks. Blockchain technology is a key element enabling this process, by creating a shared ledger where people can own their own data it also enables a shift in the locus of value within economy to the individual and networks. In a world of limited connectivity, limited transparency and limited peer-to-peer trust it was necessary to have third-party institutions to define, quantify and authenticate sources of value within society and economy. But in a world of pervasive peer-to-peer connectivity, transparency and trusted networks value can be defined through a negotiation between peers within distributed networks.

The rise of digital currencies is but one such example of this. The surprising thing for a lot of people is that most major currencies like the Dollar, Yen, and Euro aren't backed by anything they are just pieces of metal, paper and electronic entries in a bank account that get their value from everyone believing that they have value and accepts them as a medium of exchange. Currency or money works a little like a language, they are subject to network effects to give them value, the more people who agree to and understand a language the more value that that specific language has as a form of communication. Dollars, Euros, and Bitcoin have no intrinsic value they are all social protocols and they merely represent a way of supporting value flow between individuals.

In the past because of low levels of trusted peer connectivity we required centralized institutions like governments and banks to get these value exchange networks started, to support, regulate and maintain them and this gave them a lot of power. This is a critical aspect that the internet and the blockchain are changing, the blockchain enables us to create trusted and automated peer networks of exchange which greatly strengthens the capacities of people to negotiate and defined value via direct peer-to-peer exchanges. People cannow set up their own currencies with the value of the currency dependent simply on what others are willing to pay for it via an automated peer network exchange.

**Multivalue** 
But the internet of value is more than just currencies because value is, of course, a much broader concept than just pure economic utility. In talking about the internet of value it is important to recognize that on a societal level we are moving into a post-industrial services economy, the traditional conception of what society values is being revisited as a new set of societal and environmental factors reenter the equation. People are less and less content with the traditional conception of GDP as a metric for how well they are doing and more and more demanding actual quality of life, which of course engenders a broader spectrum of values.

Over the past decades, we have increasingly begun the process of tracking and accounting for different forms of value, whether that is green bonds, social impact bonds, company loyalty schemes, carbon accounting or a multiplicity of other forms. Put simply the erosion and loss of social and environmental capital that occurred during the industrial age is generating a recognition and growing awareness to their value. Metrics for how well a society is doing increasingly take account of may more environmental and social parameters in combination with GDP.

**Quantification** 
Along with this recognition to the importance of different forms of value comes also the technical means to quantify and exchange them. Through the process of datafication information technology lets us measure, track, and exchange ever more types of value at ever smaller increments, likes on Facebook, peoples attention, carbon emissions etc. with the rise of big data and IoT we will be quantifying and ascribing value to almost everything and the blockchain will provide the networked infrastructure for tracking and exchanging all these micro and macro quanta of value. This shift from the narrow form of economic value that dominated in the industrial age to a broader spectrum of value that emerges within a post-industrial society is enabled by the distributed ledger system that support what we call token economies wherein we can define a token as a measure of any form of value and then build an economy around that.

**Market Networks** 
Token economies and the internet of value build upon the current expansion of digital markets brought about by the rise of the platform economy. Over the past decades with web 2.0 we have begun the process of expanding markets to more and more spheres of life that were previously organized via centralized organizations. After only ten years of this process the biggest accommodation service in the world is no longer a centralized organization like the Hilton it is now an online marketplace, the same is true for the taxi industry, the same is true for commerce, with 10 million merchants and 440 million active users the Alibaba network is now reported as the largest retailer.

Markets are complex, they required the aggregation of large amounts of information and peer-to-peer interactions, without the technology it is much more viable to achieve coordination via a centralized hierarchical model. But as we come to quantifyand account for more and more areas of life blockchain based networks will extend the capacities of plug and play markets to all spheres of life, social, economic, technological and environmental.

**Services Economy**
This internet of value will function as the infrastructure to the emergence of the services economy which is currently taking place within post-industrial economies. With such capacities we will expand market systems to almost all areas of activity, closed organizations will be converted into peer networks, dynamically allocating resources as needed through market exchanges.

The move into a services economy results in the conversion of industrial age products into services, whereas the product based economic paradigm was about the production and consumption of more products as measured by GDP, a service economy is about value delivered, a service is an exchange of value, you don't get the product you just get its function and the value that it delivers. As such all spheres of the economy become redefined away from the static conception of units of products towards the more fluid exchanges of value. You don't by a lift to put in your office building you get it as a service paying only for the functional value it delivers, in some offices now they don't even buy the carpets on the floor, these are delivered as-a-service.

The blockchain is a key infrastructure enabling this new services economy as it requires a very fluid, dynamic and automatic tracking and exchange of value. Smart property and smart contracts will form the technological infrastructure powering the services economy as they operate within large peer networks automatically allocating resources and processing financial debits and credits for value exchanges. This huge shift in our economy lets us re-conceptualize every industry to really question what the actual value it delivers is and then reconstruct it by building token markets around that value where anyone can participate in the delivery of the service.

With web 2.0 and the platform economy, we extended the capacities of markets so that many more people could participate as exemplified by Uber enabling anyone to operate as a driver. However, these markets were centralized around the platform operators and they were dependent upon traditional currency systems. In Web 3.0, blockchain applications will function as distributed automatic plug and play markets where extremely small increments of value can be exchanged directly peer-to-peer with very high levels of fluidity. When this is coupled with IoT and data analytics we will be able to track the real value that things deliver which will help us to make the much-needed move from a product based economy to an outcomes economy that better reflects the underlying value being created and exchanged.

**Distributed Token Economy Explained**

With the ongoing revolution in information technology, our economic systems of organization are being transformed and disrupted by the rise of information networks. It started with the advent of the personal computer, World Wide Web and with the rise of online platforms the disruptive power of information networks to reshape economic organization became ever more apparent. Today this process of economic transformation continues with a new set of technologies as we are currently in the process of remaking the technology stack of the internet; building what is called web 3.0 a primary component of which is the Blockchain.

The defining feature of this next stage of economic development is that it decentralizes our economy and shifts operations to global information based networks like never before.

This distributed internet technology stack that is currently being built enables a network of computers to maintain a collective database of value ownership and exchanges via internet protocols. This bookkeeping is neither closed nor the control of one party, rather, it is public and available in one digital ledger which is distributed across the network. The most mature example of this is what we call the Blockchain. In the Blockchain, all transactions are logged including information on the date, time, participants and amount of every single transaction. On the basis of sophisticated mathematical principles, the transactions are verified by the so-called "miners" who run the computing infrastructure required to maintain the ledgers.

The technology of Web 3.0 enables a new form of decentralized economy as it removes the dependency on a centralized authority for managing the network, instead replacing it with a distributed consensus model managed by many. This shared securely encrypted database enable trustless peer-to-peer interactions via new internet protocols. People can begin to set up their own networks for coordination and direct exchanges of value peer-to-peer and it enables the rules of these transactions to be automated in new ways.

**Tokens**
At the heart of this system is the distributed ledger which records the exchanges of value. These distributed ledgers can account for and validate the exchange of any form of value; it may be a currency, it may be property, it may be a kilowatt-hour of energy, the usage of a parking spot, the number of followers a person has on social media.

These distributed ledgers provide the infrastructure for building token economies. A token is simply a quantified unit of value. Tokens are both generic and fungible. It is generic in that it can be used to define any form of value and it is fungible meaning it is exchangeable between different specific forms of value.

Traditional monetary currencies are not fully fungible as there are many circumstances when one can not exchange a monetary currency for other forms of value. For example, likes on social media may have a certain value but typically cannot be directly exchanged for monetary currencies.

A token differs from our traditional monetary currency in that it is more generic. Our existing currencies define a particular type of monetary value, what we call utility, which is based upon the economic logic of the industrial economy, while tokens because they are more generic can define a broader set of values, social capital, natural capital or cultural capital.

For example, natural capital is the integrity of an ecosystem that enables it to function and provide ecosystems services to people. In our traditional economic model, we only quantify and account for the services that the ecosystem delivers such as food, water, materials etc. However, we do not account for the integrity of the ecosystem that enablesit to function. The generic nature of the token means it can be used to account for value such as this natural capital.

The capacity to differentiate between different forms of value is made possible by the programmability of token units. Because tokens are digital they are also programmable, which enables one to specify certain rules for that token and have those rules executed when it is exchanged, thus enabling certain constraints or possibilities in its usage. One can specify that a certain token is only spendable under certain terms or specify how it can be converted. For example, one could program the token so that it can not be exchanged for diamonds that are mined in a particular location of the world known for its use of slave labor.

In this way the token is not just a unit of utility but also expresses social values. Likewise one could create a healthcare allowance in dollars or euros could be programmed on the Blockchain so that it can only be used to pay for healthcare at certified parties. Automating these measures leads to a considerable decrease in bureaucracy. This programmable token system works to shift our economies from a single value model to a multi-value model, they create many different types of value and economies but still retain the possibility for exchange between them.

**Token Markets**

The distributed web is the convergence of the economic market system with information technology, that enables us to convert traditional organizations into distributed markets based on tokens. Tokens define whatever is of value within that organization and the market system is used as a distributed coordination mechanism for managing and growing that resource.

By creating an expanded definition of value and converting closed organizations into open markets this means that we can vastly expand the scope and capacities of the economy.

The provisioning of services within the economy no longer becomes dependent upon a limited number of centralized organizations acting for profit, but instead, anyone can now provide the service via these open protocols. This means we can harness the resources of the many in a distributed fashion instead of being dependent upon a few. Likewise, the token economy can harness the motives of individuals not just for financial rewards but for a multiplicity of values.

To illustrate how this works let's think about the service of cloud data storage, currently, this is provided by a limited number of enterprises like Amazon and Microsoft. These centralized organizations have huge data centers, but still, those data centers are only a very small fraction of the storage capacity in the world, most of the storage is in the personal computing devices of end users, and most of that is not being used. Filecoin is one organization that works to create a distributed token economy for this storage. Filecoin is a decentralized storage network that turns cloud storage into an algorithmic market. The market runs on a Blockchain with a native protocol token, also call "Filecoin" which miners earn by providing storage to clients. Conversely, clients spend Filecoins hiring miners to store or distribute data. The sum of all these computers that are coordinated through an automatic market system on the Blockchain can provide, a much larger, more resilient system then the centralized model while reducing redundancy and inefficiencies in the overall system. It also pushes the provision of the service out to the location where it is demanded as people are connecting peer-to-peer locally instead of going to the centralized server that may be the other side of the planet.

**Token Investment**

Tokens such as Filecoins can be exchanged for other currencies or members can hold on to their tokens whose value may appreciate as the network grows over time. This illustrates a very interesting aspect to tokens; anyone who uses the system is also an investor in the system, thus tokens merge investment capital and liquid exchange capital in new ways. In the traditional capitalist model, we have a divide between owners of capital and workers; a divide between a more fixed investment capital and liquid exchange currencies. The shares in a company are not the same thing as what people get paid with for working in that enterprise and use for everyday exchanges in the market. This creates the notorious divide within the industrial economy described by Karl Marx, between the capitalists - that make money off of their investments - and the workers that have to stay selling their labor for money without ownership.

Tokens represent both the inherent value of the community, which is its capital investment, and they are also units of exchange within that ecosystem. The founders of the project issue a number of tokens at inception and sell those, for someone to use the system they have to buy the tokens, in so doing they become part investors in the project but they also use those same tokens to make exchanges within the market. Thus the people creating the value in the ecosystem are also getting paid in tokens, meaning the workers that are creating the value through their work also have ownership within the organization.

In the traditional utility based exchange of cash people have no ownership in the organization, they just try to make money and this can create divides between the owners and the users. The token system works to better align the incentives of the individuals with the overall system because the value of the tokens they earn is also dependent upon the value of the whole. When you are working for a token network you are both working for yourself and for the whole organization as the two become more aligned, unlike the traditional divide between capitalist and worker.

**Economic Growth**

The token system enables networks to overcome the chicken and egg problem. If you are the first user of a network like eBay, then the value would be very low, thus it is difficult to get the network started because it has to reach a critical mass before it will be of value to the users; this means that it may require a large investment to create a network. The Silicon Valley model worked by having large initial venture capital backing that enables them to overcome this, but it means that most networks don't get off the ground and that once a network reaches scale and has value it becomes dominant and very difficult to compete with; resulting in a lock-in effect and making it easy for large incumbent organizations to become extractive over time. It also means that those who founded the organization win big time. If the network takes off, it creates a winner takes all dynamic with most people losing because of the threshold.

The token system extends the benefits of being an early adopter of a new network to all the users and thus helps to solve this issue. It does this by issuing tokens for anyone to purchase at the beginning of the project, as the project grows the tokens come to have greater value for all of the holders.

This also works to make the users of the network promoters of that organization because as it grows the tokens thatthey hold become more valuable. It incentivizes people to join networks early so as to gain the benefits of the increase in their token value as it grows which reduces the problem of thresholds. With this technology companies no longer have to go to traditional capital markets through an initial public offering of shares in the company in exchange for money, but instead they simply sell tokens directly on the internet to raise initial capital for the project in what is called an initial coin offering or ICO.

**Conclusion**
To date we have had an internet patched onto the side of an economy operated through the many centralized organizations of the Industrial Age, creating a strong contradiction between the underlying technology and the institutional arrangements. The Distributed Web will work to transform this by merging information networks and economic organization as the flow of information and economic value becomes one. This will greatly reduce our dependence on centralized organizations expanding markets as systems of organization. The global market economy will become available to the many through small distributed peer-to-peer interactions running through web protocols as the decentralized internet takes us a step further into the networked economy.

**Decentralized Autonomous Organizations**
The world is changing rapidly and the internet is fast entering a new technological era as web 2.0 gives way to an emerging set of blockchain technologies. This next generation of internet technologies built on the blockchain offers many interesting new technological, economic and social innovations - such as digital currencies, distributed ledgers, blockchain IoT systems - that will transform many industries from finance and insurance to energy, and cyber security.

But probably the extraordinary thing about this next generation to the internet built on the blockchain is that it is, as one commentator noted: "an institutional technology" at the heart of social organizations and all forms of institutions is the question of how we work together by exchanging value within a trusted environment. The blockchain is a technology that enables automated trust and the automated frictionless value exchange.

This capacity to automated the basic workings of social institutions coupled with increased interconnectivity means that we increasingly have the technological means to create massive organizations that are truly distributed and automated, something we have never seen before and whose potential is only really limited by one's imagination. This potential of the blockchain to revolutions human social institutions is most clearly demonstrated in what are called distributed autonomous organizations that give us a glimpse into the future.

**Context**
Although truly autonomous decentralized organizations are something new they can also be seen as just one more step in a millennia-old process of institutional evolution. A process in which we have gone from organizations based fully upon the specific characteristics of their leaders within hierarchical structures, such as in chieftains or monarchs, to the modern bureaucratic organization that is bound by impersonal rules and formal structures designed to be somewhat independent from the whims and characteristics of any particular member occupying their roles, to today's platform economy where we have moved into semi-distributed organizations where businesses operate platforms where the rules are executed by computer code automatically.

In our current platform economy that has been built on web 2.0 technologies over the past decade, organizations are a hybrid of distributed automated platform and centralized business organization managed by people. Platforms, like YouTube, Alibaba, WeChat, Upwork or Uber, represent a combination of both centralized digital platform, operated by a private business, and distribute user-generated systems build on the platform by hundreds of millions of users.

However, things are changing fast at present and the Web 2.0 technology that created these platforms is giving way to a new era in web technology with the rise of the blockchain. Blockchain technology offers the possibility to disintermediate these platforms by creating fully distributed systems of organization without need for a centralized organization supporting the platform. With the blockchain, we now have the technology to create truly distributed organizations at a global scale, something that we previously did not have.

**DAO**
A decentralized autonomous organization, also called DAO is an organization that is run by rules that are created by their members through a consensus process and then written into a set of contracts that are run via computer code, thus enabling the automated management of a distributed organization.

On a more technical level, a DAO is an organization that is managed through rules encoded in smart contracts, and run on the blockchain. DAOs are online platform communities, with their resources organized according to rules agreed in advance and set out in its code. DAOs are open source software, capable of modification through member consensus. They are currently made possible by the development of Ethereum. Ethereum is a public blockchain which works as a decentralized virtual machine for executing peer-to-peer contracts.

DAOs are essentially a set of complex smart contracts that combine to form a set of rules that manage the operations of a group of members and their resources. Distributed organizations are based on a few core principles to their design which are ultimately trying to support a self-sustaining system of organization through local feedback loops.

**Self-Organization**
Instead of having formal management structures monitoring and coordinating the organization from a central point, decentralized organizations work through signaling systems - which are distributed feedback loops - as means for aligning the individual with the group. Distributed organizations tackle a problem by creating an infrastructure of cooperation done through the local interactions between members and signaling systems which are designed to create a self-organizing system, a good example of one such signaling system would be the feedback a buyer leaves for a seller on eBay, thus creating a signal to others about the seller's trustworthiness and self-regulation via only peer-to-peer interaction.

**Value Systems**
At the heart of these distributed organizations is the idea that groups are about value as measured by some form of a token. With distributed ledgers, we can create markets out of tokens that represent whatever value system the organization is based around. It is this value, token system and market mechanism that are at the heart of the organization, they regulate the system and define any one person's position within the group. These distributed organizations aim to be meritocratic, that is to say, a person's position in the organization is based upon the value they have contributed as measured by the other members that they have interacted with. Their value and corresponding reputation that they have received through their interaction with other members defines their status within the community, with all of this being encoded as tokens on the blockchain.

**Autonomy and Independence**
Distributed organizations try to draw upon the intelligence of many people by drawing upon their specific local knowledge. They try to avoid situations where people become overly influenced or persuaded by any highly influential member. They try to harness a diversity of perspectives from all the members.

**Evolution**
Distributed organizations try to embody the process of evolution in their design. Similar to the evolutionary process that is built into our market economy. Distributed organizations work through a process whereby members create a stock of new ideas, decisions or initiatives and then members essentially invest their tokens into those that they believe most viable and receive rewards if the initiative is beneficial to the organization. Thus mimicking the process of evolution where new varieties are created and selection is performed based upon their contribution to the whole organization.

**Conclusion**
Distributed autonomous organizations are very much in their infancy; they are still just experimental. Not only do we lack the actual finished software solutions, we in many ways still lack some of the basic science required to understand the full dynamics through which self-organizing social systems can work in a stable, safe and sustainable fashion. There are many things that can go wrong with badly designed social systems, one of the first large-scale autonomous distributed organizations was recently hacked at the cost of millions of dollars.

We are still in the experimental phase of trying to understand exactly all the parameters and dynamics that are needed to make a social system self-regulating and then building these into the software. This being said a number of distributed systems for organizational management already exist such as Backfeed or Colony being the most often cited examples.
Although such systems are still experimental in nature their potential should not be underestimated and they will only grow as the underlying technology develops and our understanding of distributed self-organizing systems matures. The blockchain and new distributed models of governance can play a major role in providing the trust infrastructure, the platforms and off-the-shelf organizational solutions to massive social systems; the type that would be required to develop functioning global institutions.

**Blockchain & Economy**
Blockchain technology has relevance for virtually all domains but because of its nature as a secure value exchange protocol the most readily identifiable ones are within finance, business, and economy. As with other areas the blockchain has the capacity to decentralize economic organization creating distributed peer-to-peer networks for exchange, in so doing greatly expand the scope and extent of economic markets and finance.

**Context Globalization**
With the ongoing developments of economic globalization we are in the process of a massive scaling up of the global economy of exchange. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall over a hundred countries have come into the global economy and the global middle class is growing rapidly. Already, about 140 million are joining the middle class annually and by 2030, it will more than double in size, from just over 2 billion today to almost 5 billion according to Reuters. Although we are becoming connected through urbanization and telecommunications many remain excluded from the formal global economy. The distributed web offers us the capacity to link individuals and small organizations directly into the global economy greatly expanding their opportunities for economic development.

The blockchain has many applications for enabling the global economy of exchange including its capacity to establish property rights where there were none, in enabling supply chain provenance, in business collaboration across industries and in enabling peer-to-peer platforms for commerce and trade.

**Property Rights**
The first component in enabling economic exchange and development is the capacity to define and enforce property rights. In this respect, Hernando de Soto has been a prominent economist in highlighting the importance of ownership in development. The main message of de Soto's work is that no nation can have a strong market economy without adequate participation in an information framework that records ownership of property and other economic assets.

Unrecorded economic activity results in many small entrepreneurs who lack legal ownership of their property, making it difficult for them to obtain credit, sell the business, or expand. They cannot seek legal remedies to business conflicts in court since they do not have legal ownership. Lack of information on income prevents governments from collecting taxes and acting for the public welfare. As he writes. The existence of such massive exclusion generates two parallel economies, legal and extralegal. An elite minority enjoys the economic benefits of the law and globalization, while 5/6 of humanity are stuck in poverty without property rights and access to formal agreements to enable exchange.

Traditional top-down attempts have been both costly to implement on a large scale and have been unsuccessful at increasing global property enfranchisement. A bottom-up approach instead follows a process wherein claims are made by individuals, verified by those affected, aggregated by the community, and then brought to the legal authority. The blockchain user monitored digital registry is the kind of tool that allows communities to serve themselves in the face of unresponsive governments.

As one example of this we can take Honduras, a country with nearly sixty percent of its land undocumented and an antiquated artisanal land registry that has allowed bureaucrats to oversee land seizuresfor their personal use with a total lack of accountability. Under foreign pressure, a digital registry for the country using blockchain technology is being built in the coming years which will enable the people of Honduras to switch over to a system with the self-verification features of the blockchain.

**Supply Chain**
Supply chains are one of the primary areas that the blockchain has found application in largely due to the fact that they involve many different organizations. Here it works to improve collaboration by creating a single database and source of true, it can reduce fraud and corruption, automate manual processes, and control for issues of authentication and trust, making obscure supply chains transparent and visible to end users. With the blockchain, we can get a much more granular view of the complete supply chain.

We could record things like all the manufacturing data for an aircraft assembly, where the elements are or the subsystem has been in its journey from the original manufacturer all the way through to integration into the final aircraft. The hashing and timestamping capacity of the blockchain mean we can record exactly who's done what to the asset over its lifecycle and with all parties being able to have access to and trust this data.

Currently, supply chains for many organizations are very complex and opaque given the fact that they have many tiers to them. When something goes wrong, like a supermarket discovering food contamination, it can take weeks for them to dig through the complicated layers to find where exactly that issue came from, with the blockchain registry you could know this information almost immediately.

A London-based company called Everledger has put more than 1.6 million diamonds on a blockchain. Entries on the digital record include dozens of attributes for each diamond, including the color, carat, and certificate number, which can be inscribed by laser on the crown or girdle of the stone. They do this to make sure that there's no false diamonds, synthetic diamonds or blood diamonds getting into the supply chain, so effectively the retailer can be sure of the complete audit trail or provenance of the diamond that they're buying and hence increasing the net value of that diamond through the improvement of trust.

There are many more examples of supply chain use cases across product based industries as the advantages for business are clear. The trust between parties goes up because everyone knows who's done what to each asset as it goes through its lifecycle. Everyone including the end user can know who's owned each asset where it's been geographically and hence the whole supply chain becomes much more efficient and transparent. Likewise, many regulatory activities along the value chain that are currently time-consuming and costly can be automated.
For example, in order to move containers through a shipping port you need a paper document called a letter of credit. The processing of this document, from issuing to approval, usually takes between seven and 10 days, a shipment from Africa to Europe can require a small pile of paper documents. The shipping company Maersk has been participating in a proof of concept, with the University of Copenhagen, to digitize the bill of lading, enabling the transaction time to be reduced to less than four hours.

**Commerce**
At the end of the supply chain process, in commerce, blockchain can enable frictionless exchanges of value peer-to-peer. Blockchain commerce platforms like OpenBazaar connects people directly via a peer to peer network, it does not require middlemen, which means no platform fees and payments are cleared via bitcoin. Data is distributed across the network instead of storing it in a central database. Each user contributes to the network equally and is in control of their own store and private data. Setting up an OpenBazaar store is simple you just download the program, run the installer, and you can have your items listed in minutes. Likewise the network has a fraud protection system via a distributed escrow system a Multi-signature escrow. where buyers and sellers agree to a mutually trusted third party to hold the funds.

**Finance**
The applications of blockchain technology to finance are many, here we will just touch on the subject of payments clearance. The incumbent banks have spent centuries building a physical structure of distribution of finance in paper form that's focused on buildings and humans and then they apply technology on top of this, the back end remains hugely over complicated. Clearing a simple credit card transaction or the purchase of a security requires bouncing it around through half a dozen intermediaries, takes days and is costly. To achieve a very simple activity of paying someone a whole pile of complicated things have to happen often at different points on the planet. Global credit card payments account for 7.7 trillion dollars with users paying hundreds of billions of dollars in fees, at the same time many remain locked outside of the formal financial system.

For the first time in human history, two or more parties, be they businesses or individuals who may not even know each other, can forge agreements, make transactions and build value without relying on intermediaries. In a world where payments can happen peer-to-peer as simply as sending an email, with the trust and transactions being handled automatically, transferring money is as simple as updating two records in the blockchain. As payments go digital in the coming decades no one pays for anything anymore, it is just around them as digital debits and credits on distributed ledgers.

The applications of blockchain to finance a numerous, in providing a framework for supporting capital markets, to a new model of venture capital in the form of Initial coin offerings, to prediction markets, but going into this would be the subject of another whole course.

**Conclusion**
Just as the Web leveled the playing field for information exchange and communications so that now the same band width of connectivity enters the financial center in london as the East coast of Africa, the president of America has the same iphone as the migrant worker in south China, so too by adding a layer of automated trust and building market platforms, blockchain technology offers the real possibility like never before to really reach out to what has previously been the edges of the global economy and directly connect them into the same platforms of exchange as everyone else.

Just as using the blockchain to expand the accounting systems of our global economy to incorporate natural capital is critical to enabling environmental sustainability, using the blockchain as an infrastructure to expand the opportunities of the global market economy to all is critical to enabling social sustainability through inclusion. Online blockchain enabled platforms could provide the tool totake us from a world of trickle-down economics to a world of trickle up economics.

**Blockchain & Technology**

A new technology paradigm is emerging as we move into this world of connectivity it is called the Internet of Things, IoT for short. The technology paradigm of the industrial age was one of machines, stand-alone mechanical systems, they were physical in nature, mono-functional and mechanized; it is a world of nonresponsive, isolated technologies each of which the end user has to manage separately.

The technology paradigm of the Information Age is one of services, it is a world where individual component technologies are instrumented and connected into larger networks of devices that can communicate peer-to-peer, adapt and self-organize around the users needs so as to deliver a seamless service. The best illustration of this is the smart city, where different systems no longer exist in silos but are interconnected and organized around the end users needs.

The Internet of Things is a journey we are just beginning on over the course of the next decade billions of devices will come online, the amount of data the internet has to deal with will grow massively as vast networks of machines continuously communicate with each other, to coordinate production processes, for transport and logistics, for construction, climate control etc.

This will require an IT infrastructure that goes far beyond the existing capacities of the internet in terms of dealing with massive amounts of secure data, secure communication transactions and automated micro exchanges of value between systems and devices on the edges of networks. This is part of what the next evolution in the internet will have to deal with, a world of upwards of 20 billion devices constantly streaming data and making secure micro exchanges between each other. Put simply this world of a fully fledged IoT infrastructure to our economies would be an almost unimaginably complex system.
The issues here can be thought of in threefold, firstly the bottlenecks created by existing cloud-based IoT systems secondly issues surrounding the security risks of centralized systems, and thirdly enabling automated dynamic resource allocation between machines.

**Centralized Systems**

At present IoT systems often depend upon a centralized architecture where information is sent from the device to a proprietary cloud where the data is processed using analytics and then sent back to those tiny IoT devices to coordinate them. As with all centralized systems, this doesn't scale well. In a world of complexity, you have to have much more processing and coordination out on the edges, with coordination happening peer to peer so as to reduce the bottlenecks and centralized security vulnerabilities. In order to scale you need to be able to make the decisions locally, process the data locally and also be able to share resources locally between devices on demand. Likewise, security is, of course, a huge issue with the internet of things, more and more we are connecting our critical infrastructure up to the IoT a good example being the development of the smart grid or urban transport coordination systems. The blockchain is promising for IoT security for the same reasons it works for cryptocurrency: It provides assurances that data is legitimate, and the process that introduces new data is well-defined.

A decentralized approach to IoT networking could solve many issues. Adopting a standardized peer-to-peer communication model to process the hundreds of billions of transactions between devices will significantly reduce the costs associated with installing and maintaining large centralized data centers and will distribute computation and storage needs across the billions of devices that form IoT networks. This will prevent failure in any single node in a network from shutting down the whole network.

By leveraging the blockchain, IoT solutions can enable secure, trustless messaging between devices in an IoT network. In this model, the blockchain will treat message exchanges between devices similar to financial transactions in a bitcoin network.

**Resource Allocation**

The other major issue is that of dynamic resource allocation. Just as a money economy allows for better, faster, and more efficient allocation of resources on a human scale, a machine economy can provide a robust and decentralized system for handling these same issues on a machine scale. Thus this internet of things is going to need a micro payment system where devices can pay on demand per resource, this won't work with transaction fees or having to wait for centralized third parties for authentication.

We really want to make it possible for one machine that has excess capacity or excess resources, like for example computational power storage or electricity, to be able to sell that to another machine which needs it more. One example often given of this is autonomous vehicle automatically negotiating highway passage if they are in a hurry, paying other cars to let them pass first. Coordinating air delivery drones is another potential use case for device-to-device micropayment where drones may pay a solar recharging station belonging to someone else to get charged up with electricity.

**Plug and Play**

The internet of things will be all about networks that deliver services, where any device that can contribute to the overall function of the network will be able to automatically plug into the network offing its capacities and receiving tokens in exchange. This kind of computing environment needs a kind of permissionless innovation layer where anyone can start participating and contributing to any network. Whether that is providing a 3D printer within a manufacturing network, a bicycle in a transport network or a room in an accommodation network. A connected device will be able to provide services and receiving payments for work done that are automatically credited to the owner's wallet. This will create all sorts of security, privacy and financial issues that the blockchain is well suited to enable as data can reside with the end device and made available only when and as needed.

One example of this is the DAV network, which stands for decentralized autonomous vehicles. DAV is a blockchain platform currently under development that allows anyone to buy or sell autonomous transportation services in a decentralized market. Their platform integrates into any autonomous vehicles, enabling those vehicles to discover, communicate, and transact with one another using a digital token called DAV. People can earn DAV Tokens by providing transportation services, a self-driving car could give rides to passengers when not needed by its owner or a drone could help with a delivery.

**IOTA**

Blockchain technology is the missing link to settle scalability, privacy, and reliability concerns in the Internet of Things but of course the blockchain infrastructure of the present could never scale to the demand that is needed, new blockchain infrastructure will have to evolve. Probably the most promising project in this respect is IOTA which aims to be the distributed network protocol enabling the machine economy.

The main innovation behind IOTA is what they call the Tangle, a new distributed ledger design which is scalable, lightweight and makes it possible to transfer value without any fees. The Tangle ledger is able to settle transactions with zero fees so devices can trade exact amounts of resources on-demand, as well as store data from sensors and data loggers securely and verified on the ledger.

While the whole world has adopted the ‘Sharing Economy’ in areas like driving and accommodation, IOTA enables a whole new realm where anything with a chip in it can be leased in real time. Most of our belongings stay idle for the vast majority of the time that we possess ownership of them, but through blockchain IoT networks a lot of these things like Appliances, Tools, Drones, eBikes etc. and resources such as computer storage, computational power, WiFi bandwidth etc. can be turned into leasing-services effortlessly.

**Blockchain & Environment**

Typically when talking about applications of blockchain people start by talking about currencies, finance and then more general business applications such as supply chain, then possibly learn about its potential use for the Internet of Things. What is rarely talked about is its applications to the environment, but as we will try to illustrate in this video this could turn out to be one of its most important potentials.

To understand why we need to appreciate that the reason we are in an environmental crisis is largely a function of the design of our economic system. We developed our modern economic framework in a world that was industrializing with abundant natural resources and limited industrial infrastructure. The system was set up to grow GDP by producing and consuming more products with limited interest to the effects this had on the environment. As a consequence natural capital was not accounted for in the system creating a strong incentive for people to simply overuse natural resources, converting what was not accounted for into increase GDP and profits.

Today, of course, we realize that this whole linear economic framework is unsustainable and one of the most effective ways to alter the model is to try and incorporate the costs and benefits that accrue from ecosystems into economic accounting. This means essentially placing a value on the ecosystems so that people factor the full environmental cost of their actions into the cost-benefit equation under which they are acting, this is called full cost accounting or natural capital accounting. The idea is not new, indeed it is becoming ever more mainstream, in a recent Ernst and Young report entitled, “Accounting for Natural Capital — the elephant in the boardroom”. The executive summary starts by saying, “Natural capital will become as prominent a business concern in the 21st Century as the provision of adequate financial capital was in the 20th Century… We are already ‘drawing down’ on 50% more natural capital a year than the earth can replenish — and the rate of depletion is accelerating. All too soon, businesses will face a stark choice: adapt or fail.”

This powerful capacity of blockchain token economies to design new incentive structures has the potential to fundamentally alter the current dynamic. When designed properly token economies can provide powerful incentive structures for people to collaborate on growing some underlying source of value to the community. This same capacity can be harnessed to develop and grow the natural capital of a community to build their ecosystem.

Unlike our traditional industrial age economic system that simply quantifies and incentivizes people to consume products, by creating token systems we can actually incentivize and reward people for any action that is of benefit to growing ecological resources. Tokens can be gained by choosing less consumptive options that conserve and replenish resources.

For example, think about a small town in rural Australia that has a limited amount of water to go round, a finite amount of water tokens could be issued and earnt for any activity that conserves on water. For example, if you replace your plumbing with a system that leeks less you would earn water tokens that could be used elsewhere or traded for fiat currency, meaning that people can earn by conserving creating an economy around it and an incentive system.

Or with respect to carbon emissions a token economy could likewise be created to manage this in a distributed fashion, every time you emit carbon you pay for it with a kind of carbon coin. Every time you sequester carbon, you get paid in carbon coins. When all carbon coins have been redeemed, the world is running at net zero carbon.

Likewise, any community could take account of its stock of natural capital and issue a finite amount of tokens to the community members, if someone does something that is ecologically beneficial to grow that underlyingstock they could earn more tokens. Likewise, if someone wanted to chop down
lots of trees they would have to purchase tokens from others, this would incentivize people to go and
plant trees or perform other activities that contribute to their ecosystem in order to earn tokens. In
such a way ecological services would not have to be managed and performed by a central authority as
anyone could clean the lake or switch to a renewable energy to earn carbon tokens and thus provide
environmental services.

Of course closed organizations have always seen the benefit of conserving in their production because
it directly affects their balance sheets, but what is happening with token economies though is that we
can push that capacity to benefit from conserving out to the end user and the edges of the network so
that we can harness everyone's incentives to conserve, which is potentially a much more powerful
mechanism than centralized organizations simply telling people to be nice and environmentally
friendly which doesn't really work because it lacks real incentives.

Of course, the move towards a full cost economy will not happen overnight, already it has been
growing over the past decades with such things as organic food, green bonds, carbon trading etc.
Incentivised recycling systems are already made possible on the blockchain via the Ethereum based
token-based Dapp RecycleToCoin. The token platform allows the Public to exchange harmful plastic
at their reverse vending machines and central collection charity shops for tokens. This cryptographic
reward is then exchangeable on participating crypto exchanges for other currencies.

The recognition and increasing quantification of ecosystems services coupled with the development of
a fully fledged blockchain natural capital accounting system could support a fundamental reorganizing
of the incentive structures in our economy towards one that is systematically more sustainable.

As Prince Charles noted "The ultimate bank on which we all depend — the bank of natural
capital — is in the red; the debt is getting ever bigger and that is reducing Nature’s resilience and
considerably impeding her ability to restock. It leaves us dangerously exposed.”
Fixing that equation requires a new accounting system and the blockchain could be a critical enabling
technology.

**Supply Chains**
The blockchain would not only be important in enabling a token economy for managing ecosystem
capital but also as a system for tracking, authenticating and making transparent the underlining
workings of supply chains and business activity.

At present when we go buy something, we have little idea where it comes from or how it's made.
Supply chains are conventionally held secret, limiting the stakeholders who can prevent
environmental, social and health and safety problems. There are so many intermediaries, and it's very
easy to be deceitful. Companies can perform all sorts of actions without it being revealed to the end
user who gets greenwashed by massive amounts of advertising so that they don't know what to think
when they walk down the supermarket aisle.

Blockchain could enable environmental transparency along the supply chain of products. A
blockchain could ensure that a grouper fish being tossed through Tokyo's Tsukiji Market actually
came from a sustainable fisherman in Indonesia or to track the price that villages in Kenya were paid
for their coffee beans. The Provenance blockchain has been used to verify proof of payment to 55
farmers whilst tracking coconuts from South East Asia to Europe. The initiative has demonstrated the
possibility of using blockchain technology to track ethical claims and digitally prove fair trading
practices. Working with NGO Fairfood, Provenance tracked ethics claims on 1000 coconuts. Using a
grassroots certification approach, they tracked the moment of payment one way and product the other
way, registering the harvest via SMS, and verifying chain of custody along the supply chain.

As discussed previously the blockchain is not magic, it can only authenticate what is within the
network, in order to ensure that the information that is inputted into the system is authentic and correct
it needs to work in tandem with other technologies. Here again, the blockchain will have to intersect
with IoT systems and big data advanced analytics if we are going to be able to automatically ensure
that the fish was fished at the date and location inputted to the network. Data automatically inputted
from tamper-proof IoT systems and cross-correlated with data points from a multiplicity of other
sources could work to create truly trustworthy inputs and reliable information to someone on the other
end of the supply chain automatically without human intervention via the distributed database. For
example, an IoT device in a warehouse might scan the RFID tags on pallets when they come in to
verify the date of entry.

This is one of the advantages of big data, it is also decentralized not relying on a single data source,
but multiple varied sources cross-correlated. The blockchain itself can't provide a trustworthy supply
chain it will have to be integrated with these other technologies to enable trusted, automatic and
distributed oracles for data input that are not dependent upon corruptible third-party institutions. This
is of course particularly relevant in parts of the world where government organizations are not
trustworthy. Knowing that the apple you bought has been certified organic by a country at the bottom
of the list of corrupt nations doesn't really tell you very much.

**Distributed Systems**
On a broader level, we can identify the centralization of many existing systems as a huge source of
vulnerability in a world of climate and environmental change. In a world of stability centralization
appeared to create efficiencies and stability, but today we are increasingly recognizing these large
centralized components create critically vulnerable single points of failure with huge dependencies.
Large centralized components like large financial institutions, electrical power stations, or factories
also create inertia within the system and reduce adaptive capacity and the agility required to deal with
systemic changes.

By supporting peer-to-peer distributed systems the blockchain can enable greatly more agile, adaptive
and potentially more resilient networks with lower dependencies on critical centralized elements.
Removing the need for the centralization of resources can also greatly increase the efficiency of these
networks as resources can be exchange locally peer to peer without having tobe always routed to a centralized component. Blockchain platforms can enable local food systems, where the food is grown locally disintermediating the long complicated supply chains of supermarkets, by matching producers and consumers peer-to-peer locally.

Or as another example blockchain based Power Ledge provides a platform for people to trade energy peer to peer within a local smart grid. With this people simply trade electricity with one another and receive payment in real-time from an automated and trustless reconciliation and settlement system. There are many other immediate benefits such as being able to select a clean energy source, trade with neighbors, receive more money for excess power, benefit from the transparency of all trades on a blockchain with very low-cost settlement costs. Likewise, power ledger supports carbon trading via smart contracts.

**Blockchain & Society**

As noted the blockchain is as much an institutional technology as an information technology. It not only enables us to greatly strengthen the capacities of peer networks through automated trust but also by enabling the recording and exchanges of value it allows us to design incentive systems. In this module, we are going to discuss the implications and possibilities of blockchain technology for designing new forms of peer-to-peer social institutions.

Of course peer-to-peer networked forms of social organization have always been there from the earliest days, however, previously they have remained the domain of the local and the personal as they do not scale well without supporting communications technology. Throughout the modern era, formal hierarchical social structures came to replace informal communities as the dominant organizational paradigm. It is only in the past decades that we have seen the emergence of a new form of social structure that reverses this process, the social network.

**Social Media**
With the rise of web 2.0 technology came a revolution in the form of social networks that now connect billions of people engaging them in a very personal way. Today social media is the forum where much of public and private discussion takes place, in which people express their values, commenting and sharing, connecting and collaborating in new ways. This leaves a huge mismatch between our existing formal institutions and these new informal social networks, between the world of the physical and its hierarchies and that of the digitally networked organization; with constant friction between them as social networking increasingly comes to affect events in the offline world.

Much of this mismatch remains because we have a somewhat secure social infrastructure for enforcing and enabling trust offline in the form of the nation state's institutions, but to date have not had this for social networks that remained largely lawless, trustless and the property of private enterprises that organized them towards extracting data and creating profits via advertising. This is what the blockchain could change. The decentralized web could provide the security layer to enable trust in social networks, trusted identity, trusted reputation, trusted value exchange, all supported by a decentralized IT infrastructure.

Steemit is the best example of a social network built on the blockchain which has scaled to be a relatively large application with over half a million users and over four million posts as of the start of 2018. Using a blockchain enables rewarding comments and posts with secure tokens of value. User accounts can upvote posts and comments, and the authors who get upvoted can receive a monetary reward in Steem tokens. People are also rewarded for curating popular content. Curating involves voting comments and post submissions. Steemit has a reputation system where an account's received votes can influence its reputation up and down, incentivizing online etiquette and interaction within the community.

**Open Organizations**
In the previous internet of information, online social networks remained relatively limited in their capacities, largely confined to the domain of media and information exchange. In a secure internet of value, these kinds of social networks can potentially power all of human social organization, from how we organize enterprises and work together, to how we do education and governance. This is a brave new world, for the past few hundred years we have fleshed out the hierarchy with ever more detail and understand well how it works, but moving from this world of the hierarchy to that of networks requires thinking about many aspects of what regulates social organization and makes them work - going from chains of command to feedback systems, from fixed roles to functions, from authority to reputation, from closed boundaries to open networks - means reconsidering and redesigning the basics of social organization.

As with other areas the decentralized organization will be an open network of protocols that enable people to couple or decouple from the network on demand, contributing small or large increments of value in exchange for tokens. Without centralized control, distributed feedback mechanisms in the form of reputation systems will play a key part in regulating the organization. Likewise, big data and analytics will likely play a part in working to understand the network and its users, dynamically coordinating resources and capabilities according to their specific capacities and requirements.

Colloney is one such project that is trying to build a distributed social organization for collaboration within blockchain based social networks. Built on Ethereum Colony describes itself as the people layer of the decentralized protocol stack. Rather than centralized ownership and hierarchical management, smart contracts distribute ownership according to the value each individual contributes, and influence emerges from the bottom-up through systematic peer review of contributed work. Each colony has its own token that represents a share of the ownership of the organization. Smart contracts are programmed to distribute ownership tokens according to the value each individual contributes. Contributors can later trade their tokens on the open market for cash. Colony also comes with a reputation system that allows people to review and grade others’ contributed work.

**Governance**
One of the main applications of the blockchain as an institutional technology could be in enabling new forms of political and governance structures that would be relevant for an age of connectivity and globalization. Over the course of the modern era, the bureaucratic nation-state formed as the critical infrastructure organizing and supporting all other forms of social institutions, from education to healthcare, to security. However, this institutional infrastructure of the nation-state has remained national in scope and capacities while major economic and technological changes are increasingly taking us into some kind of global system of organization.

In short we increasingly live in a very complex globalized economic system that is the primary organizational structure for humanity in the 21st century, national governments increasingly have limited capacity to affect the workings of that system and this leaves societies without the capacities to shape their future or even have input into decisions that affect them as a community.

A number of different projects are currently trying to build the next generation of borderless governments base on the decentralized web including such projects as Culture, Bitnation and Democracy Earth.

BitNation is a collaborative platform for do-it-yourself government built on blockchain technology. According to its official website, “Bitnation provides the same services traditional governments provide, from dispute resolutions and insurance to security and much more — but in a geographically unbound, decentralized, and voluntary way.”

To set up a political unit with Bitnation a group of people would write their own legislation, put it onto a Bitnation blockchain and everyone who wants to live by it signs up. To give it some force, they would write smart contracts that are tied to assets they own. Blockchain combined with IoT make it possible to use information and technology instead of relying on force and centralized authority. In such a way it is possible to substitute expensive, error-prone intermediary parties for algorithms that never make mistakes are incorruptible and run automatically.

Likewise, the Democracy Earth project from Chile is building a self-sovereign system claiming that with the rise of open source software and peer to peer networks, political intermediation is no longer necessary. They are building an application called Sovereign, an open source and decentralized democratic governance protocol for any kind of organization.

Sovereign is open source software for incorruptible blockchain-based voting within institutions of all sizes, from the most local involving two people to the most global involving all of humanity. Members own their own data securely on the blockchain network, vote on issues they care about or delegate power to those they already trust, while participatory budgeting is enabled by bitcoin & smart contracts.

**Token Economies**
With distributed networks, we could harness token economies to power political organization and social engagement in the management and development of their communities. The whole suite of public services could be provided by distributed blockchain networks through the use of social token economies.

Social functions could be provided by anyone in return for tokens. Instead of depending on centralized institutions for all forms of social services they could be provided by anyone qualified and willing on demand, re-engaging and empowering citizens to take responsibility for their own communities, earning community tokens for taking care of elderly people locally, for performing acts that support local security watch schemes or even just mowing the lawn in the park, and for all the other functions that currently cost taxpayers lots of money.

In this respect, public services would no longer have to be bound to a particular nation or territory. Similar with legal systems they too would no longer have to be bound by territory, a given community could choose its own legal system, as these projects aim to implement the full set of legal services for the creation of legal contracts, their adjudication, and enforcement. It simply requires interoperable standards between these different jurisdictions.

**Conclusion: The Institutional Technology**

The prominent blockchain thinker Primavera De Filippi summarizes nicely much of the significance of the blockchain as an institutional technology when she notes "today the blockchain is marking the beginning of a new digital revolution whose focus is not just human communication but rather human interaction and cooperation. What the internet has done to achieve global interpersonal communication the blockchain could do today to achieve global and systematic collaboration. The blockchain is a new coordination technology that relies on a decentralized network of computers in order to coordinate individual actions in a completely distributed and decentralized manner… by analogy with nature you can think of the blockchain as a way for people to mimic the social dynamics found in certain species of animals like ants and termites as a way to promote and ideally achieve collective intelligence, by recording individual actions on a distributed database the blockchain makes it possible for people to coordinate themselves directly and collaborate on a global scale, without any centralized authority or hierarchical structure….across all domains of society cooperation can lead to much better results if only it can be properly orchestrated, and this is exactly what the blockchain provides."

**Complexity**
Ours is a hugely complex and ambitious global society and economy of upwards of seven billion people. The world has got a lot more complex in just the past few decades. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall the rise of globalization and information technology the connectivity and complexity has been rapidly escalating and with the internet of things, it will only continue.

There is increasingly a strong mismatch between the design of our institutions and the complexity of the environment they operate in. Centralized organizations that were designed within the context of the industrial age that was stable, predictable and limited in connectivity and complexity are stalling and becoming fragile along many dimensions.

It is no accident that our primary social institutions are not delivering the desired functional outcomes when they are most needed. Political systems are no longer a forum where people can express their opinions and make collective decisions about the things that affect their society. The educational system of the industrial age is organized in such a way that it seems incapable of delivering the education that people need for today's world. It is becoming apparent that our health care systems aren't designed to really deliver health. Only a small fraction of the resources in our financial systems actually goes into productively funding economic activity in the real economy while most of it disappears into the world of high finance.

As cybernetics taught us for any organization to be functional the internal complexity of the system's structure and functions has to be sufficed to match the complexity of its environment. Our world just got a lot more complex and the centralized architecture to these systems limits their capacity to deal with that and deliver the required outcomes.

In responding to the complexity of this new world these systems need a more network model that removes the bottlenecks created by the centralized component and pushes capabilities out to the edges where they can be recombined via automated networks on demand. This is exactly what online platforms do but as the underlying infrastructure of the networked society these platforms cannot be owned and operated by private enterprises towards their own benefit. The current platform society is unsustainable, it takes societies most needed resource, data, and connectivity, and puts it in the hands of large enterprises to create huge profits and creates dangerous concentrations of power in the boardrooms of technology companies.For the move into the information age to be viable and sustainable the internet needs to become a global, public, secure, trusted, distributed cloud computing infrastructure, and that is the potential of the blockchain and indeed what makes it of critical importance to where we are as a burgeoning global civilization. With this IT infrastructure we are able to revisit all these systems of organization and question what is the underlying value or service they deliver and then rebuilt token economies to reflect that value and function as a distributed management system replacing the centralized management structures of the past.

**Distributed Systems**
We will conclude with one final point here with respect to decentralization, whether or not the blockchain enables this more decentralized and more equitable world that many hope does not turn on the technology itself, technology is never anything more than a tool, whether this tool really helps us build a decentralized world on all levels depends more on the values that we embed in it. As Harvard professor Yochai Benkler noted, "It is not enough to build a decentralized technology if you do not make it resilient to reconcentration at the institutional, organizational or cultural level, you have to integrate for all of those."

Blockchain will decentralize the underlying technology and enable us to build a more distributed world but whether that turns out to simply be re-centralized on another level turns on the question of the values incorporated into the token economies that we are currently building. Do we embed a single set of values into the token economy as we did in the past or do we use this to quantify and manage for all forms of value, social, cultural, environmental etc. thus enable this more equitable and distributed world. This won't be determined by a technology innovation and won't be defined by some powerful organization it will emerge out of each of us expressing our values through token systems.
