# CHAPTER 7
## Creating an Enabling Environment for Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Development

The BOL provides opportunities for the rebuilding of the Bangsamoro economy. During the pre-colonial and the early stages of colonial period, the Bangsamoro communities hosted vibrant commercial and trade centers. From the time of resistance against colonialism to the emergence of contemporary Moro uprising, the Moro people have been preoccupied with their pursuit of autonomy and the recognition of their distinct identity. This has, in part limited the region’s overall economic growth, leaving them decades behind compared with other Mindanao regions.

Maguindanao for example, even with the creation of ARMM, remained dependent on the economies of Region XI (Davao) and XII (SOCCSKSARGEN) while Lanao del Sur and its Moro-dominated municipalities are contributing much of its product and services to Region X (Northern Mindanao).

The BARMM must let go of this dependency to revive its economy. Industries must be developed for revenue and employment generation. Further, to foster inclusive growth, the BARMM government must harness its natural resources (fertile land, marine, and minerals) through a long-term and comprehensive agricultural development. This would require land reform, investments, access to Islamic banking and finance, research and development, technology transfers, human skills development, job creation for young and unskilled workers, competitive support infrastructure, lower costs of energy, water, transport, logistics, market linkages, market-driven micro, small enterprise development, and firm environmental protection measures.

A developed Bangsamoro economy will contribute to the economic stability of Mindanao and the whole country in general.

### Sectoral Assessment
#### State of the Sector

In 2018, ARMM contributed 0.6 percent to the national gross domestic product (GDP), growing at 7.2 percent, it is the highest among all regions. It is an agricultural-based economy with the agriculture, forestry, and fisheries (AFF) sector having the largest share at 56 percent among other sectors. The improved economic performance was mainly due to the recovery of AFF which grew at 5.8 percent in the same year.

For the last quarter of 2019 until the second quarter of 2020, the BARMM government focused on restructuring the bureaucracy and the recruitment of new employees. The system is expected to take around six months to put in place processes and operate into the new Bangsamoro government.

Maguindanao province frequently experiences natural and human-induced disasters that have caused massive displacement of communities. Agricultural products that serve as the major source of livelihood are also at stake during floods. In Central Mindanao, big chunks of aquatic plants such as water hyacinths, are usually accumulated and clogged in the columns of the Delta Bridge in Rio Grande de Mindanao and other major tributaries, causing rivers to overflow and consequently submerging nine towns in Maguindanao and nearly breaching the bridge linking the province and South-Central Mindanao areas.

##### Priority traditional commodities
**Palay production.** Palay production in Mindanao comprised 23 percent of the national production in 2018, of which 6.0 percent was from ARMM. As for corn production, Mindanao accounts for 53 percent of the national corn production, wherein 16 percent of it was from ARMM (PSA, 2018).

**Palay production.** In 2018, the volume of palay production was estimated at 1.16 million metric tons, increasing by eight percent from 1.08 million metric tons in 2017
