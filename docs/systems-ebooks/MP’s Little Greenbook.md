**Message**

Bismillahi Rahmani Rakeem.
Assalamo Alaikom Warakmatullahi Wabarakatuhu.

Francis Scott Fitzgerald, a well-known American novelist, once said: “You write because you have something to say.” I wish to acknowledge and congratulate **MP Baintan Adil-Ampatuan, MNSA** and former House of Representatives **Executive Director Violeta T. Veloso, MNSA** for creating a very informative and easy-to-read guide that reflects their intimate knowledge of the legislative process and its part in democratic governance. While it is written from a personal point of view, it will undoubtedly be valuable to new parliamentarians, students studying the law and politics, and those who have not worked or participated in policymaking but who are interested in the Bangsamoro Parliament, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, and legislative policymaking in general.

As the Speaker of the Bangsamoro Parliament during this critical transition period, I take pride in the Members of Parliament whose individual capacities and depth of experience are among the finest of the Bangsamoro, and who represent in Parliament with still-undiminished fervor the people’s hopes and dreams. When viewed from the perspective of our democratic aspirations, this guide is timely because it documents some milestones in representation and policymaking that have fostered development in the region. These milestones are part of our journey, and this guide testifies to the efforts we have put in to achieve sustainable peace and national security.

While this may be considered a supplementary reference material, this book is also a thoughtful guide for both me and my colleagues, a gentle reminder of our duty to Allah (S.W.T.) and people, and the crucial role we play in nation-building.

**Our Humble Goal**

This Little Green Book aims to guide first-time Bangsamoro Members of Parliament (MP) in the discharge of their functions. The workings of the parliamentary form of government are relatively unknown to many. As a hopefully easily accessible and friendly read, this guide can be used by current and future MPs and their staff to supplement usual reading materials. It contains nuggets of found wisdom that MP Adil-Ampatuan wishes someone had told her when she was starting out as a neophyte MP in February 2019. It also provides insights into certain facets of parliamentary work gained from long years of Dir. Veloso’s service in the Secretariat of the House of Representatives. In no way or form, however, do the authors mean to replace any of the existing rules, regulations, and practices of the Parliament with this document.

The Little Green Book is also an attempt to document the early stages of the Bangsamoro Parliament and the uniqueness of the setup of the government. This piece was born out of compassion, and in recognition of the efforts of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) leadership who have steered this transition government through all the challenges it encountered. Creating new structures, institutions, and mechanisms; crafting legislation during the pandemic while also establishing new norms in service delivery; and unifying the multiple Moro fronts and ethnolinguistic groups: these are strides that are worth documenting, especially since every day that democracy is protected and allowed to flourish is a strong, resolute step towards the attainment of lasting peace.

This Little Green Book is an informal and living document, a constant and ever-evolving work in progress, and an invitation to expound and to improve. Nevertheless, the material draws from the authors’ lengthy work experiences as civil servants in the executive and legislative branches of government.

An engineer by profession, **Baintan Adil-Ampatuan** was a development worker before becoming an MP. Parliament was a totally new arena that she unexpectedly came upon and one which she had to learn to adapt to as a non-politician.

**Violeta T. Veloso** worked in the House of Representatives for 35 years and served as Executive Director of the Committee Affairs Department for 24 years. Her participation in the creation of this book is her way of recognizing the critical importance of generating a cadre of well-trained legislative workers and an informed citizenry that could thus participate more meaningfully in policymaking, in nation-building, and in the strengthening of democracy.

**Introduction**

Dear Member of Parliament,

*Mubarak* and congratulations on your appointment or election as an MP of the BARMM!

As a public servant, you have a significant responsibility to your constituents and to the Bangsamoro as a whole. As an MP, you have the unique opportunity to significantly contribute to the self-determination of the Bangsamoro. Building from a collective history of armed struggle, weapons are no longer our sole instruments for achieving change. You can now guide and steer the policies that shall help realize change and promote lasting peace.

Among the laws that serve as framework to Bangsamoro plans and policies are the 1987 Philippine Constitution and Republic Act (RA) No. 11054, also known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL). Both testify to the recognition of lawmakers of the long and protracted struggle of the Bangsamoro, and the earnest attempts to rise above it through the multiple peace pacts between the Government of the Philippines (GPH) and the Moro fronts. These cover the 1976 Tripoli Agreement and the 1996 Final Peace Agreement (FPA) between the GPH and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), as well as the 2012 Framework Agreement and the 2014 Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB) with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).

The autonomy granted to the Bangsamoro under RA No. 11054 makes it the only political unit that now enjoys regional self-government within the Republic of the Philippines which is a unitary state. This guide was, therefore, prepared in recognition of the unique structural setup within the Bangsamoro, and how this impacts the relationship between the Bangsamoro Government and the National Government, and more importantly, the work of the Bangsamoro Parliament.

We decided to call this The Little Green Book—’little’ as it is but a humble offering to those entrusted with the huge responsibility of scrutinizing and crafting policies, and ’green’ which is the color that symbolizes hope and, therefore, the aspirations of the Bangsamoro. ‘Green’ is also a figure of speech used to refer to neophytes, who we hope will gain important insights into the strategic role of the regional Parliament in forging peace and development.

The guide is composed of six (6) parts, each corresponding to the important facets of a BARMM MP’s job and how to undertake them. These are: 1) what to do first; 2) legislation; 3) oversight; 4) representation; 5) other unwritten rules; and 6) wrapping up and moving forward. For easy reading, we have tried to discuss substantive topics in a light and conversational manner, supplementing this with diagrams and maps, definitions and process guides from official BARMM documents, quick facts, as well as true-to-life experiences and anecdotes. We hope that the tools, techniques, and suggestions contained in this guide can help and inspire new, aspiring, and even more experienced Members of Parliament, as well as students and researchers.

We wish you the very best of luck in your journey. May you be a beacon and an instrument of hope amid the challenges faced by the Bangsamoro people.

**What to Do First**

**1 First Things First**

Congratulations!

You have sworn before the people, and above all, to the Almighty, that you will faithfully discharge to the best of your ability the duties of your present position and of all others that you may hereafter hold under the Republic of the Philippines. The oath in itself is a constant reminder of the weight of your responsibility. Standing before this vast and unfamiliar terrain, how will you start this new journey?

As a Member of Parliament (MP), you are duty-bound to carry out responsibilities that are stipulated in the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) while meeting the expectations of your constituents. Your new duties and responsibilities as an MP covers three basic functions: **legislation**, **oversight**, and **representation**. This guide will walk you through these functions.

**1.1 Understanding the Working Environment**

It will get easier as you familiarize yourself with your new working environment (see Figure 1). A major part of an MP’s work is knowing how to engage multiple stakeholders. This covers your own organization, as well as various external international, national, and local actors.

Under the Bangsamoro Organic Law or BOL, for the purpose of transition from the defunct Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) to the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) shall lead the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA), without prejudice to the participation of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), and representatives of non-Moro indigenous peoples (NMIPs), the youth, women, settler communities, traditional leaders and other sectors.

The BTA is composed of 80 members who are appointed by the President, and are themselves the Members of the Parliament during the transition period. As of this writing, the first formal election of the Bangsamoro Parliament has been scheduled on May 2025.

The powers and functions of the Bangsamoro Parliament are provided for in the BOL. The Parliament is headed by the Speaker, the Deputy Speakers, the Majority Leader, the Minority Leader, and the Majority and Minority Deputy Leaders, all of whom constitute the officers of the Parliament.

At the national level, the Office of the President (OP) exercises oversight powers over the transition government. The OP exercises supervisory functions over local government units (LGU) and national government agencies (NGAs) including the Office of the Presidential Adviser on Peace, Reconciliation and Unity (OPAPRU, formerly the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process). The Bangsamoro Parliament is like the Congress of the Philippines although the latter is a bicameral body which is comprised of the Senate and the House of Representatives.

At the local level, MPs must also engage with provincial, municipal, and barangay local government units (LGUs), grassroots people’s organizations (POs), traditional leaders, Ulama (Muslim religious leaders and scholars), non-Moro indigenous peoples, the youth, women, settler communities, and other sectors.

The processes of the Bangsamoro government also allows for the participation of various civil society organizations (CSOs) and non-government organizations (NGOs), the academe, and business groups, both at the regional and sub-regional levels.

Across this environment, you will encounter many bilateral and multilateral development partners, humanitarian agencies, and non-government organizations supporting the Bangsamoro and the broader Mindanao agenda for peace and development. Although many of these organizations have been operating in the region for a long time, only a handful have provided direct support to the Parliament, preferring to work directly with the Bangsamoro ministries, offices, and agencies (BMOAs) or the peace process mechanisms. Some international partners working with the Parliament are the European Union (EU), through its Support to Bangsamoro Transition (SUBATRA) project, alongside the United Kingdom’s Westminster Foundation for Democracy capacity development project.

**1.2 Understanding an MP’s Rights and Obligations**

In any Parliament, MPs enjoy certain rights (refer to Box 1) as they are expected to fulfil certain obligations (see Box 2). Unless changed by the succeeding Parliament, the rights of MPs are provided for in Secs. 1 and 2 of Rule II, Approved Resolution (AR) No. 268, otherwise known as the Rules, Procedures, and Practices (hereinafter referred to as the Rules) adopted by the BTA Parliament.

**Box 1. Rights of the Members of the Parliament**
**(Section 1, Rule II, AR No. 268)**

a. Equal rights, privileges, and obligations. Parliamentary rules and procedures shall be administered impartially;
b. Right to receive all notices and schedule of sessions, committee hearings, and meetings;
c. Equal rights to make and present motions;
d. Right to second motions, when necessary;
e. Right to a full and free debate and discussions of motions presented before the plenary sessions, committee hearings, and meetings;
f. Right to vote on motions, except when they have a conflict of interest or financial and pecuniary interest in the legislative measures under consideration, in which case they have to inhibit from participating in the proceedings;
g. Right to know the meaning of the issues and the questions being debated and discussed;
h. Right to object when any portion of this Rules is being violated;
i. Shall not, in a debate and discussion of any proposed legislative measure, have to suffer personal abuse and attack from the other Members;
j. Right to access to all the minutes and journals of the sessions, committee meetings, and hearings; and
k. All other rights and privileges provided for under the OLBARMM and this Rules.

**Box 2. Duties and Responsibilities of an MP**
**(Section 2, Rule II, AR No. 268)**

a. Prepare, introduce and work for the passage of legislative measures to effectively address social, political, and economic needs and concerns in the BARMM;
b. Be obliged to promptly attend plenary sessions, committee hearings, and meetings of which they are Members or where they are the authors and sponsors of the proposed legislative measures under consideration;
c. Stay in the session hall and committee rooms until the end of the session, committee hearings, and meetings;
d. Must be ready to intelligently participate in the debate of the legislative measures under consideration either in the plenary, committee hearings and meetings, or public consultations;
e. Articulate faithfully the demands and interests of their constituencies as well as those of other sectors that are affected by proposed legislative measures or by conditions, issues and concerns requiring legislative action;
f. Secure, through every lawful means possible, any and all data and information relevant and necessary for the determination and formulation of appropriate legislative actions and measures on public issues and concerns;
g. Make information pertaining to the performance of their legislative and constituent functions and duties available and accessible to the public;
h. Can speak openly but shall allow everyone his/her turn to speak;
i. Must treat everyone with respect and courtesy and shall not use abusive and insulting language, impute accusation of dishonest conduct or corrupt practices against fellow Members of the Parliament;
j. Must follow the rules of debate as provided in this Rules; and
k. Perform such other functions and activities as may be lawful and necessary to ensure the passage of legislative measures needed to effectively address the social, political, economic needs and development of the Bangsamoro.

**1.3 Understanding the Basic Rules**

Your rights, duties, and responsibilities as an MP are defined in the Rules and certain parliamentary practices that have become part of tradition and procedure, many of which are stipulated in the BOL.

The Rules are adopted by the Parliament at the start of its operations. Pending the approval of its own Rules, a new Parliament can also provisionally adopt the Rules of the immediately preceding Parliament. Read and understand the provisions of the Rules especially matters relating to committee affairs and plenary sessions. Observe how the officers apply them. You may also watch the proceedings of other parliaments such as the recordings of the first and second BTA sessions, the recorded or live sessions of the United States Congress or the Parliament of the United Kingdom, or the sessions of the Philippine Senate or House of Representatives. See what protocols apply in instances that are not covered by the Rules of the Bangsamoro Parliament.

Approved Resolution No. 268 of the Bangsamoro Parliament codifies the BTA’s Rules and incorporated those adopted by the first BTA (see Box 3).

If you wish to seek clarifications regarding the Rules, you may raise it formally in the committee, in the plenary, or informally with the Speaker, the Deputy Speakers, the Majority Leader, the Minority Leader, Deputy Majority Leaders, the Deputy Minority Leaders, and the Committee Chairpersons. Likewise, you may seek advice from the Secretary-General on administrative and legislative matters. The Secretary-General and the Sergeant-at-Arms are elected by the Parliament, but are not MPs.

Once it has adopted its Rules, the Parliament organizes operating committees, which may then eventually prepare their own internal rules. The internal rules of each committee provide for the composition of the committee, its subcommittees, if any, its procedures for the conduct of meetings and hearings, the processing of measures until they are reported out, and the roles and responsibilities of the committee secretariat.

In the second BTA, several committees have more than one Vice-Chairperson. Some committees also chose to conduct their meetings through video conferencing, albeit on a case-to-case basis.

Secure a copy of both the Rules and the internal rules adopted by the committees you are a member of or in whose proceedings you wish to participate. You will need to find time to read and internalize both. Aside from the BOL, these rules are your basic guide to effectively participate in the affairs and processes of Parliament, including plenary sessions and committee meetings.

**1.4 What you should do first as a new MP**

**A. Submit administrative requirements upon assumption to office**
Immediately after your assumption into office, you are required to submit certain documents to the Parliament’s Secretariat. These documents include, among others, the Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth; the Civil Service Commission (CSC) Personal Data Sheet (Form 212); your appointment paper (for Presidential appointees) or a Proclamation Certificate (for elected officials); and your signed Oath of Office and Oath of Moral Governance. Your office also needs to be covered by a government bond to be recognized by the depository bank of the Parliament.

**B. Familiarize yourself with the Parliament’s organizational structure**
You will find that the bureaucracy could be less complex if you know who does what and where to go if you need to ask questions. Getting acquainted with organic officers of the Parliament and keeping their contact details can be a great help in sorting out administrative matters.

**C. Find appropriate office space**
There are limited office spaces at the Bangsamoro Parliament building in Cotabato City which was inherited from the now-defunct ARMM Regional Legislative Assembly. The offices of the Secretariat are in the building to ensure easy access to staff services. Due to space limitations, however, only a few officers, especially those whose offices should be centrally-located given the magnitude of transactions with other Members and the public, can be accommodated in the building. Until a new Bangsamoro Parliament building is constructed, the best option is to rent commercial or residential space near the Bangsamoro Government Center. When more space is available in the Parliament, securing an office should be prioritized by your staff.

**D. Decide whether to join the Majority or Minority**
Right after the appointment or proclamation of the winning candidates, assess the party affiliations of your fellow MP. During these informal discussions, you can sense who are potentially strong candidates for the Speakership. Reach out, research, and talk to as many members as you can. At this stage, suspend your initial judgment and observe developments keenly. Generally, it is not a good idea to decide hastily or reveal your position too early. However, Sec. 4 (b), Art. IV of the Bangsamoro Electoral Code provides that the changing of political party affiliation during the party representative’s term of office shall *ipso facto* forfeit their seat in the Parliament. This should weigh upon your plans and decision.

Towards the run-up to the election of the Parliament’s leaders, you can choose where you and your interests best fit. Depending on your circumstances, it is basically a choice between aligning with the Majority or the Minority. You will be part of the Majority if you voted for the nominee for Speaker of the ruling party. Conversely, you will be part of the Minority if the nominee you voted for Speaker does not win.

The ruling party or group that comprises the Majority in the Parliament shall exercise control over the reins of the Bangsamoro government, hold the power over its resources, and be accountable for the success or failure of the government. The Chief Minister shall come from the ranks of the Majority and shall be elected by the Parliament. The Chief Minister appoints the Cabinet members who will execute the policies set down by the Parliament. Essentially, the Majority will constitute the Government of the Day (GOTD).

The Minority is composed of the parties and MPs who opt not to join the ruling party. The Minority is not necessarily the opposition, as the term ‘opposition’ could merely refer to agendas and advocacies that differ from those held by the ruling party. A functioning Minority is needed in order to ensure checks and balances in policymaking and the execution of laws. They serve as “fiscalizers” and perform important tasks such as scrutinizing budget allocations and the utilization of funds by the government, as well as the formulation of policies and their implementation. This is necessary in a democratic process because it will allow the sharing of other perspectives, help improve the crafting of policies and the implementation of programs and projects. Hence, both the Majority and Minority are necessary in a democratic process.

The leadership must manage the policymaking process to get the best ideas from Members, formulate new legislative measures to address current issues, identify loopholes in existing policies, formulate remedial legislation, and ensure that the government fulfills the mandates enshrined in national and local laws.

Debates are the lifeblood of a parliament. The word ‘parliament’ itself comes from the old Anglo-Norman term for ‘discussion’, or ‘discourse’, or simply, ‘to talk’. An MP has to learn how to deal with different and sometimes conflicting points of view. Democracy allows everyone a turn at the podium. When debating contentious issues, sometimes it’s not about winning the vote. Even if you know that you will lose in the final vote, being able to raise your points and put them on record can make you feel as satisfied. Representation also requires an MP to exercise leadership by seeking a compromise on contentious issues and finding ‘win-win’ solutions.

**E. Analyze the approved budget of the Parliament**
The Parliament has its own budget, which covers the Offices of MPs and their respective staff and the Parliament’s Secretariat. You may request the Office of the Finance Director for the breakdown of expenditures of the Parliament’s budget. The budget will inform your office’s plans and activities.

**F. Choose your committees**
There are two (2) types of committees in the Parliament: Statutory and Parliamentary. The Rules adopted by the Parliament contains the list of committees and describes their respective jurisdictions. The Rules also provide for the number of members of each committee who are then elected within days of the inaugural session. Usually, the GOTD moves for the election of the respective Committee Chairpersons, Vice-Chairpersons, and members, which shall then be concurred with by the plenary. Part of the motion of the Majority Leader for the election of members of each committee is the election of Members who come from the Minority.

The MPs can choose their preferred committees and may manifest this to the Majority Leader through a form that the latter sends out through the Secretariat. The maximum number of committee memberships of each MP shall be determined by the GOTD upon the recommendation of the Majority Leader.

In general, the most strategic committees in terms of representation and constituency servicing are the committees on Finance, Budget and Management; Rules; Accounts; Ways and Means; and Public Works. An MP may also choose other committees whose jurisdictions are related to their area of interest or expertise.

**G. Recognize who your friends, allies, and non-allies are**
To facilitate the passage of your legislative agenda, it is vital that you establish a network of support, and identify groups whose principles and agendas are opposed to yours. Find and establish friendships, secure allies, and make a mental note of those whose perspectives differ with yours. You may disagree on one issue but converge on other advocacies or interests, so keep an open mind.

You can initiate small caucuses and invite important actors to informal meetings, starting with your immediate circle of friends. Through these meetings, you can observe and come across information about the inclinations and plans of other groups, especially non-allies.

Parliament caucuses are usually convened prior to the formal ceremonial opening of each regular session. This is a good opportunity to get to know each other. Reach out to your colleagues. Sit with a group of MPs in the lounge over a cup of coffee and engage in informal discussions. As a new MP, it is a good idea to observe and listen to these conversations. Join, if you must.

**H. Read, read, read**
If you are a new MP, the first order of the day is to know the internal rules of the Parliament. As mentioned earlier, this will facilitate your participation in discussions at both the committee and plenary levels. Read, re-read, internalize, and slowly familiarize yourself with the Rules by keenly observing parliamentary proceedings. You can also watch the video recordings of previous plenary and committee proceedings. If there are provisions in the Rules that are not clear to you, do not hesitate to ask veteran MPs to mentor you and to explain parliamentary procedures and practice, especially the precedence of motions. Former MPs can be mentors but because the Rules undergo changes through time, always be guided by current provisions.

**I. Set your direction and organize your office**
To establish the direction of plans and activities of the office, it may be helpful to engage a professional facilitator or planner. You can also request the Parliament’s Policy Research and Legal Services (PRLS) and the Planning Division for assistance. Once you have hired staff and your office has been set up, an internal strategic planning and teambuilding activity may be in order. See Part II, Sec. 9 of this guide on Defining Priority Measures for suggestions on formulating your work program.

**J. Break the silence, conquer your fears**
They say that the most difficult part of doing something is figuring out how to start. It is completely normal especially for new MPs to be afraid at first and to stay above the fray for a while, so to speak. The key in overcoming this fear is to observe the proceedings and what other MPs are doing, especially new colleagues, and to determine your legislative priorities. Most of the time, the priorities of MPs differ in the sense that while some are interested in pursuing legislation on subject matters that represent the needs of a wider constituency, others prioritize the concerns of their specific sectors. Bill drafting and networking will largely be accomplished through staff support. But as a neophyte, how do you make a mark and signal your inclination on a specific issue you want addressed?

There are many ways of breaking your silence. One is to deliver a privilege speech during the Privilege Hour. Based on the Rules, the Privilege Hour is held for a period not exceeding sixty (60) minutes every Thursday of the regular sessions, and shall not be interrupted by any question or motion except a point of order or a motion to adjourn. Your first speech will introduce you to the Parliament—your new colleagues will be happy to know and appreciate who you are. Aside from the issue you wish to speak about, the speech should describe your background, relevant affiliations, and constituencies. Your privilege speech may call attention to certain social, political, or economic issues and seek remedies from the government and its agencies and instrumentalities.

The second manner of breaking ground is to introduce a simple resolution during the plenary session. Usually, the simplest resolutions come in the form of commending successful individuals and associations, or simply congratulating those whose accomplishments are noteworthy, be it in the field of sports, education, government service, or service to the country. You may also co-author a resolution or a bill if introducing one seems to be daunting.

Participate in the deliberations of the committees. You may express support for a measure because it is part of your advocacy or its objective is close to your heart. Similarly, you can state in a simple manner the reasons behind your objection to the measure.

After you conquer your fears at the committee level, find space in the plenary to do the same. If you feel nervous during your initial oral manifestation during the session, you can prepare comments in advance. Feel free to supplement these notes with your own extemporaneous thoughts while you are rendering your manifestation. This will make your message more heartfelt and sincere.

**2 BARMM History 101**

As an MP, you must have at least a basic understanding of the institution in which you are working. This requires the acquisition of in-depth knowledge about the region’s long history, and its relationship with other institutions in and outside the Bangsamoro region.

As depicted in Figure 2, a simplified modern conflict and peace historical timeline of the region begins with the 1902 Zamboanga and Dansalan Declarations, and continues on to the founding of the Muslim Independent Movement (MIM) in 1968, to the organization of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) in 1973, and to the founding of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in 1978.

Prior to the signing of the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB) in 2014 between the Government of the Philippines (GPH) and the MILF, two (2) major peace agreements were forged involving the MNLF. The first was the 1976 Tripoli Agreement between the MNLF and Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRP) with the participation of the Organization of Islamic Conference under the stewardship of then-President Ferdinand E. Marcos. The second was the 1996 Final Peace Agreement on the implementation of the Tripoli Agreement under the administration of then-President Fidel V. Ramos.

Several administrative arrangements were put in place in areas covered by the Tripoli Agreement. These arrangements were formalized in 1989 with the creation of the ARMM under the administration of then-President Corazon C. Aquino. Five (5) years after the signing of the 1996 Final Peace Agreement with the MNLF, the autonomous region was expanded by virtue of the enactment of RA No. 9054 or An Act to Strengthen and Expand the Organic Act for the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, Amending for the Purpose Republic Act No. 6734, Entitled “An Act Providing for the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao in 2001.

Pockets of resistance to the peace process continued in some areas of Mindanao in between these negotiations. In recent memory, the conflicts associated with the Moro insurgency peaked with the declaration of an all-out war against the insurgents during the administration of then-President Joseph E. Estrada in 2000. Peace talks continued after the ouster of Estrada and the assumption of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo into office in 2001, only to be halted again in 2003 when government troops overran MILF facilities in Buliok, Maguindanao. The resumption of the peace process in 2005 provided a glimmer of hope until a major debacle occurred in 2008, when the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional the Memorandum of Agreement on Ancestral Domain between the GPH and the MILF. This event heightened the conflict between the MILF and the Philippine government once again, and led to several acts of violence against government military camps and installations.

Efforts to resume the peace talks were next made under the leadership of President Benigno S. Aquino III. This led to the formulation and signing of the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro (FAB) in 2012, which was subsequently followed by the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB) in 2014. Progress was again halted with the unfortunate mis-encounter in 2015 between the Special Action Force of the Philippine National Police and the Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces (BIAF) of the MILF. The resulting fallout led to the non-passage of the envisioned Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL) drafted by the first Bangsamoro Transition Commission (BTC).

But the commitment of stakeholders remained firm and undiminished. Soon, negotiations resumed with the assumption to office of President Rodrigo R. Duterte. President Duterte appointed a second BTC to draft the BOL. The 5-month Marawi Crisis in 2017 did not deter the peace process and its champions. The BOL was enacted into law and ratified by the people in 2019, which consequently led to the abolition of the ARMM, and the appointment and organization of the BTA. In 2021, Congress enacted RA No. 11593 which extended the term of the BTA until June 2025. In August 2022, two (2) months after his assumption to office, President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. appointed the second BTA members.

Figure 4 illustrates a simple comparison of the defunct ARMM and the current BARMM. The former operated as an autonomous region within a national presidential form of government, while the latter is operating as a regional parliamentary system under the country’s presidential form of government. The ARMM Government had three (3) equal branches of government, while under the BOL, the legislative and executive authorities are vested in the Parliament. The defunct ARMM had 48 executive offices and 24 Regional Legislative Assembly (RLA) members. Under the BOL, the BARMM interim Cabinet shall be composed of 15 primary ministries with sub-offices, and the Parliament shall be composed of eighty (80) members. Like the ARMM, the BARMM judiciary system is under the Supreme Court. However, pursuant to the BOL, the dispensation of justice in the BARMM shall be in consonance with the Constitution, *Shariah*, and traditional or tribal laws.

**3 Understanding the Structure of the BARMM**

**3.1 The Relationship between the National Government and the Bangsamoro Government**

The Republic of the Philippines has a presidential form of government. Upholding the Constitution in its recognition of the Moro struggle as well as the stipulations in the 2014 Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro, the Congress, through the BOL, provided for the establishment of a regional parliamentary form of government in the BARMM.

Section 3 of the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 13 provides that “[T]he BARMM is an autonomous regional government with asymmetrical relationship with the Republic of the Philippines and shall be parliamentary in form”. Its political system is democratic, and all government authority resides in the people who have the right, in accordance with law, to freely participate in political processes.

All powers, functions, and responsibilities not granted by the Constitution or by national law to the Bangsamoro Government shall be vested in the National Government (Sec. 1, Art. V, BOL). The President exercises general supervision over the Bangsamoro Government to ensure that laws are faithfully executed. The President may suspend the Chief Minister for a period not exceeding six (6) months for willful violation of the Constitution, national laws, or the BOL (Sec. 1, Art. VI, BOL).

The law also created the Intergovernmental Relations Body (IGRB) to coordinate and resolve issues on intergovernmental relations through regular consultation and continuing negotiation in a non-adversarial manner (Sec. 2, Art VI, BOL). The Philippine Congress-Bangsamoro Parliament Forum was also created for purposes of cooperation and coordination of legislative initiatives (Sec. 3, Art VI, BOL).

**3.2 Structure of the BARMM**

**3.2.1 Wali**
The ceremonial head of the Bangsamoro Government is the *Wali* (Sec. 1, Art. VIII, BOL). Under the BOL, the *Wali* shall only perform ceremonial duties such as opening the session of the Parliament, administering the oath of office, dissolving the Parliament upon the advice of the Chief Minister after a 'vote of no confidence' against the Government of the Day (GOTD), calling for an election of a new Parliament, and attending public ceremonies.

**3.2.2 Parliament and the Government of the Day**
The Parliament has the authority to enact laws on matters that are within the powers and competencies of the Bangsamoro Government (Sec. 3, Art. VII, BOL).

The executive function and authority shall be exercised by the Cabinet which shall be headed by the Chief Minister. The Chief Minister shall be elected by a majority vote of all the MPs.

The Chief Minister nominates the two (2) Deputy Chief Ministers who shall be elected by the Parliament, and appoint the members of the Cabinet, the majority of whom shall come from the Parliament (Sec. 4, Art. VII, BOL).

The GOTD refers to the Cabinet headed by the Chief Minister, and composed of other Ministers appointed by the Chief Minister, majority of whom shall also be MPs. The GOTD during the transition period, is the MILF-led majority with the participation of the MNLF and other Members of the Bangsamoro Parliament who voted for the latter’s leadership therein (Sec. 4, Introductory Provisions, BAA No. 13).

**3.2.3 The National Government and BARMM links with LGUs**
The Constitution mandates that LGUs shall have a just share, as determined by law, in the national taxes which shall be automatically released to them and that they shall be entitled to an equitable share in the proceeds of the utilization and development of the national wealth within their respective areas, in the manner provided by law, including sharing the same with the inhabitants by way of direct benefits. This means that the LGUs of the BARMM have a share in the annual national tax allocation, (formerly known as the internal revenue allocation), and this is released directly by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) to the LGUs. On the other hand, nationally-funded projects may be implemented by NGAs or through a memorandum of agreement with other parties, including the BARMM.

The Bangsamoro Government enjoys fiscal autonomy in the utilization of resources allocated by the National Government and locally-collected revenues. The bulk of its funding comes from the national government which is equivalent to five percent (5%) of the net national internal revenue tax collection of the Bureau of Internal Revenue and the net collection of the Bureau of Customs from the third fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year before the enactment of the BOL. This is referred to as the **annual block grant**.

Republic Act No. 7160, or the Local Government Code (LGC) of 1991 provides that the President shall exercise general supervision over local government units to ensure that their acts are within the scope of their prescribed powers and functions (Sec. 25, Book I, LGC of 1991).

The BOL authorizes the Bangsamoro Government to regulate the affairs of its constituent local government units and in accordance with a Bangsamoro local government code to be enacted by the Parliament. The BOL also provides that the privileges already enjoyed by local government units under RA 7160, as amended, and other existing laws shall not be diminished (Sec. 10, Art. VI, BOL).

**3.2.4 The Bangsamoro Justice System**
As discussed earlier, the dispensation of justice in the BARMM shall be in consonance with the Constitution, *Shari’ah*, traditional or tribal laws, and other relevant laws. *Shari’ah* shall apply exclusively to cases involving Muslims. Where a case involves a non-Muslim, *Shari’ah* law may apply only if the non-Muslim voluntarily submits to the jurisdiction of the *Shari’ah* court. The traditional or tribal laws shall be applicable to disputes of indigenous peoples within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region (Sec. 1, Art. X, BOL).

**3.3 Structure of the Parliament**

On the first day of session and whenever there is a vacancy, the Parliament shall elect the Speaker, Deputy Speakers, the Majority Leader, the Minority Leader and their deputies, and such other officers as the Rules may provide. Their duties and responsibilities are provided in the Rules.

Other officers of the Parliament who are non-members are the Secretary-General and the Sergeant-at-Arms, both of whom are elected by the Parliament. Their duties and responsibilities are also provided in the Rules.

The Parliament and its committees are provided administrative and technical support by the Secretariat which is under the administrative supervision and control of the Speaker. The Secretariat is headed by the Secretary-General. The Parliament’s Secretariat consists of the Plenary and Committee Affairs Department (PCAD), the Legislative Technical Affairs and Information Services (LTAIS), the Policy Research and Legal Services (PRLS), the Administrative and General Services Department (AGSD), and the Finance Services (FS). The Secretariat is composed of officers and staff who occupy plantilla positions and those hired on a contractual basis. All the personnel of the Parliament are appointed by the Speaker, except for the Secretary-General, the Sergeant-at-Arms, and those appointed to positions above salary grade 24.

**3.4 Composition of the Parliament**

The BOL provides that the Bangsamoro Parliament shall be composed of eighty (80) Members. Forty (40) seats or fifty percent (50%) shall be occupied by political party representatives, 32 seats or forty percent (40%) by parliamentary district representatives, and eight (8) reserved seats by sectoral representatives. All Members are elected or appointed in the manner prescribed by the BOL and the Bangsamoro Electoral Code.

**3.4.1 MPs with Executive Positions**
According to the BOL, the majority of the Cabinet members shall be Members of the Parliament. Thus, several MPs have both legislative and executive functions and may be ministers, deputy ministers, or heads of offices.

For example, in the second BTA, nine (9) out of 15 ministries are headed by MPs. These are:
1. Ministry of Public Works;
2. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Agrarian Reform;
3. Ministry of Social Services and Development;
4. Ministry of Science and Technology;
5. Ministry of Finance, and Budget and Management;
6. Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education;
7. Ministry of Public Order and Safety;
8. Ministry of Transportation and Communications;
9. Ministry of the Interior and Local Government.

Likewise, the heads of the Bangsamoro Youth Commission (BYC) and the Bangsamoro Pilgrimage Authority (BPA) are also MPs. One of the Deputy Majority Leaders of the Parliament is also the head of the Bangsamoro Attorney General’s Office. The Chief Minister and the two (2) Deputy Chief Ministers are also MPs. Additionally, in the first BTA, 12 out of 15 ministries, (except the Ministry of the Interior and Local Government; Ministry of Trade, Investment, and Tourism; and Ministry of Transportation and Communications), were headed by MPs. The heads of the Bangsamoro Women Commission, BYC, and BPA were also MPs.

**3.5 A Cursory Glance at Some of the Differences Between the Bangsamoro Parliament and Other Parliaments**

The Bangsamoro Government is unique in the sense that it has a parliamentary form of government under the control and supervision of the President of the Republic of the Philippines which has a unitary presidential form of government. While the Bangsamoro Government enjoys autonomy and self-rule, its laws, rules, regulations, and policies should be consistent with national laws.

Table 1 compares different political systems around the world, including the Philippines, based on selected variables. For purposes of brevity, the table is limited to 20 countries, including eight (8) Muslim states, that are familiar to most Bangsamoro MPs.

The selected 20 countries have different types of political systems, such as the parliamentary, presidential, presidential-parliamentary, communist, transitional, and Constitutional monarchy systems. The Muslim countries of the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia have comparatively more women representation in the Parliament with fifty percent (50%), thirty percent (30%), and twenty percent (20%), respectively. Significantly, the BOL provides for women and youth representation in the Parliament and this is echoed in the Bangsamoro Electoral Code.

Many Parliaments in the list have specialized units to conduct budgetary analysis and provide for a specific number of staff positions, which is not the case in the Bangsamoro Parliament. These statistics may be valuable for benchmarking as the Bangsamoro Parliament continues to move forward.

**4 Setting Up Your Office**

An MP’s office should have enough space for staff and a reception area. The basic office equipment and supplies such as computers and printers, storage for files and important papers, a record book, activity board, calendar, among others, should be made available.

You may also opt to establish a district office if resources will allow it and if the demand is high. If you are an elected parliamentary district representative, then this becomes necessary. Set up an office in the most strategic, accessible, and safest area.

Reliable internet connectivity is also a necessity nowadays because it facilitates communication, networking, and constituency servicing.

**4.1 Staffing, Training, and Staff Management**

Politicians may choose staff from their roster of supporters. In the current setup, there are at least nine (9) staff positions assigned to each MP, although officers of the Bangsamoro Parliament have more staff compared to the regular MPs, due to the breadth of responsibilities handled. Majority of the positions are confidential in nature, and the staff that are hired for these positions are those who, first and foremost, enjoy the trust and confidence of the MPs. It would be beneficial to include at least a lawyer or two (2) in your team, alongside a writer, a communications officer, and a political officer.

Significantly, it is recommended that your Chief of Staff (COS) be a lawyer who is experienced in the workings of the government and the bureaucracy. The COS shall serve as the head of operations and is expected to guide the rest of the staff in the affairs of the office. You may opt to add staff on a job order basis, the expenses for which shall be charged to your monthly budget.

Conduct staff meetings at least once a month to guide the staff in their activities. Ask the staff to report on the progress of their assignments and the challenges they faced while doing their tasks. Pinpoint problems and attempt to find and apply solutions.

Training is essential for the MP and staff. Legislative work requires research, an understanding of parliamentary processes, a healthy appreciation of political events, and their impact on the work of the Parliament. If you and your staff have no experience yet in parliamentary work, then it is a must that you undergo legislative technical training. It can be beneficial to the office if staff members who have undertaken technical training echo important learnings to the other members of the staff. This could be done during the monthly staff meeting.

Moreover, you need to set and manage expectations, especially that of your own staff. At the onset, clarify with your staff that your term of office is only three (3) years, unless you are re-elected. Also, emphasize that re-election is costly and, thus, requires overall good performance. Underscore that the most convincing credential is a reputation for industry and conscientious work, and that it is the surest way for one to be rehired or promoted on the job.

**4.2 Office Budget and BMOAs District Project**

You may request the Finance Director of the Parliament to brief you on the budget of your office. As well, the Minister of the MFBM can be requested to provide information on the projects of Bangsamoro ministries, offices, and agencies (BMOAs) for your district that were included in the General Appropriations Act of the Bangsamoro (GAAB). Your COS or Finance and Administrative Officer may inquire with the Finance Services and staff of senior MPs about allocations for your office in the Parliament and your district.

**4.3 The Need for Completed Staff Work**

Because of the multifarious activities of an MP, staff members have to be relied on to observe the dictum of “completed staff work (CSW).” Among the most major activities of an MP’s office are those that deal with stakeholders such as development partners, national government agencies, LGUs, academe, and non-government organizations (NGOs). It would be advantageous for the office to maintain and update a directory of stakeholders that contain names, designations, and contact details of important personages. A database of partners and experts whom you have met and want to meet is valuable to the office. Additionally, a filing system for submitted position papers must be made part of the office’s records. This filing system should be indexed for easy retrieval and updating. Ensuring that office records are kept orderly and secure must be emphasized.

The crafting of legislative measures requires careful research, consultation with concerned stakeholders, validation especially when analyzing budget proposals, their implications, and budget utilization, among others.

A most important but often overlooked facet of budget analysis is budget utilization. This reveals the absorptive capacity of agencies and offices which most certainly needs to be justified in cases where an increase from a previous year’s allocation is proposed even as an office has shown very low absorptive capacity. Budget utilization rates are therefore necessary when considering budget proposals.

**4.4 Liaising with Other Offices in the Parliament**

The COS of an MP may need to network with their counterparts, the offices of the Parliament’s Secretariat, most especially with the Office of the Secretary-General for legislative and administrative concerns, the FS and AGSD for financial and administrative concerns, the PRLS for research support, the PCAD for plenary and committee concerns, and the LTAIS for public information and media relations. It is also important for the MP to establish close working relations with the Office of the Speaker, the Office of the Majority Leader, and the Committee on Rules. This will help facilitate the processing of your legislative measures.

**4.5 Communication and Media Relations**

Some MPs may have personal access to and enjoy an excellent relationship with members of the media, but many MPs do not. This is an aspect of an MP’s communications program that can be developed on the job. One way of encouraging interest in your agenda is being open to media interviews, whether formally or on a more personal basis. Communicating your thoughts and advocacies will help stimulate public discourse and encourage the policy environment to take cognizance of issues.

The critical role of social media in times of crisis has been demonstrated well in the past. An MP and the MP’s office may seriously consider establishing social media presence to encourage public participation, facilitate feedback, and highlight the office’s responses to issues.

Media relations however, can either be a stand-alone activity or be a part of a wider communications plan that includes social media participation. To be efficient in this area, an MP may either hire a media relations officer, or develop a communications team within the staff. This requires that certain staff members either have experience in newspaper, tv, or radio work, or the demonstrated capability to write press releases, short articles, and to draft speeches—tasks which can be supervised by the COS or the MP.

**4.6 MPs with Executive Positions**

Members of Parliament who hold executive positions must maintain two (2) separate physical offices. Considering BARMM has existed since 2019 and it had inherited office buildings in the defunct ARMM, MPs with executive positions may already have set up their respective offices. But an MP should maintain a separate office space that will house the staff dedicated to legislative work.

**5 Planning and Monitoring as an MP**

Planning is not just for the BMOAs. An MP should come up with a strategic or annual plan that clearly indicates comprehensive goals, objectives, programs, and projects for three (3) years or more. Plan annually if you intend to come up with just an action plan on a yearly basis, and not the full term. Table 2 shows a suggested monitoring template for an Annual Work and Financial Plan that you can use to track your level of accomplishment.

Ideally, the plan should take into account the priorities set by the Bangsamoro leadership. Such priorities are usually contained in the Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP), and in the agenda enunciated by the Chief Minister. The BDP contains the medium-term (six-year) plan of the Bangsamoro Government and is consistent with the Philippine Development Plan, while the Chief Minister’s Agenda is a three-year agenda composed of term-based priorities.

The annual or strategic plan of your office should be informed by these two (2) major documents, alongside your priorities or those of your constituency. It must be articulated clearly to the members of your team so that responsibilities and work targets are defined. There should be an annual work and financial plan even if it only consists of indicative targets.

The progress of your office’s strategic plan should be monitored to determine whether or not targets are met, to identify bottlenecks, and to ensure that appropriate solutions are employed. The plan may be reviewed every quarter, semi-annually, or annually.

A tracking system can likewise be prepared to monitor the progress of the bills you authored or co-authored. The system should reflect the stages of legislation. Table 3 shows a matrix that can be used to track the status of bills you either principally author or co-author.

A principal author may be a sole author or one of many who filed the measure in its original form based on prior arrangements or as manifested during First Reading. All other MPs manifested on the Floor as authors of a certain measure after First Reading are considered co-authors. Needless to say, tracking the processing of measures will indicate how far they have gained progress in the legislative mill and more importantly, how much support or traction they have acquired.

Table 4 is a matrix that can be used to track the processing of Resolutions authored and co-authored by an MP.

A separate calendar of activities or a staff-managed calendar of activities is likewise a good tool for monitoring your own daily, weekly, and monthly outputs.

Tracking your activities and your office’s may be useful for purposes of maintaining a verifiable record of accomplishments and pending work. This will be handy in tracking staff deliverables and identifying weaknesses in networking, and can facilitate the drafting of accomplishment reports.

**6 Engaging the Internal Environment**

**6.1 Engaging the Leadership and the Majority**

Regardless of political affiliation, an MP must acknowledge and respect the Parliament leadership and its mandate because it represents the voice of the people. Be mindful of the policy priorities of the Chief Minister and the Government of the Day (GOTD) and align your priorities accordingly. To support or to challenge the leadership are options you could take, but in a democratic set-up, the majority rules.

Develop working relations by establishing informal linkages with leaders and their circle of trusted allies. Find alternative ways to reach out to the leadership and the members of both the Majority and the Minority. In general, learn the dynamics of relationships within the leadership and the Parliament so you can successfully steer your agenda.

**6.2 Engaging Bangsamoro Ministries, Offices, Agencies, and Parliament Officials**

As part of unwritten protocol, whenever there is a need to engage the heads of Bangsamoro ministries, offices, and agencies (BMOAs), as well as the officials of the Bangsamoro Parliament (such as the Secretary-General, Sergeant-at-Arms, Directors of the Parliament’s Bureaus), an MP may request their presence in the MP’s office. However, you may also opt to visit the Ministers and heads of BMOAs. If the Minister is also an MP, there will be more opportunities to engage them. You could do it informally in the MPs' lounge during a break in the plenary session, or over a cup of coffee in the office of the Minister.

**7 Engaging the External Environment**

**7.1 Engaging the National Government**

Identify your friends and potential partners at the national level, especially those in the Office of the President, the Senate, House of Representatives, various Constitutional bodies, as well as the Supreme Court. Among the offices an MP has to engage are the national agencies that are critical to the peace and development of the region, such as the Office of the Presidential Adviser on Peace, Reconciliation and Unity (OPAPRU); Office of the Special Assistant to the President (OSAP); Department of Budget and Management (DBM); Department of Finance (DOF); National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA); Department of Education (DepEd); Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH); Department of Agriculture (DA) and its Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR); Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR); Department of Health (DOH); and Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD).

Pay courtesy calls on your close friends and contacts in these institutions, and you can later reach out to the other agencies and offices. Explore possible support they could extend to your office or to the Bangsamoro as a whole which you could arrange for. Link the various departments with their counterparts in the Bangsamoro, if needed. Identify the focal person in charge of BARMM concerns in these offices and communicate with them constantly. If possible, invite them to visit the region or to an informal dinner. During these opportunities, explore the potential areas of support and cooperation.

**7.2 Engaging Local Government Units**

The region is composed of six (6) provinces, three (3) cities, 116 municipalities, and 2,590 barangays. The six (6) provinces are Maguindanao del Norte, Maguindanao del Sur, Lanao del Sur, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, and Basilan. The three (3) cities are Marawi, Lamitan, and Cotabato.

Maguindanao del Norte is composed of 12 municipalities; Maguindanao del Sur, 24 municipalities; Lanao del Sur is composed of one (1) city, 39 municipalities, and 1,159 barangays; Sulu, 19 municipalities and 410 barangays; Basilan is composed of one (1) city, 11 municipalities, and 210 barangays; Tawi-Tawi is composed of 11 municipalities and 203 barangays. Marawi City is made up of 96 barangays, Lamitan City with 45 barangays, and Cotabato City with 37 barangays.

The Special Geographic Area, composed of 63 barangays has now been organized into eight (8) new municipalities created by the Bangsamoro Parliament.

Engage local chief executives, especially those from your district, and slowly expand your engagements to other areas. As much as possible, attend events and activities in the localities, especially during their annual founding anniversaries or general assemblies.

Listen to the proposals of local leaders and if possible, include some of them in the priority impact projects of the Bangsamoro ministries, offices, and agencies (BMOAs). You may also bridge them and their proposals with the concerned BMOA, so these will be included in the latter’s regular programs.

**7.3 Engaging Non-Government and Other Civil Society Organizations**

Many non-government organizations (NGOs) and civil society organizations (CSOs) have been operating in the BARMM for decades. Whenever there are opportunities, respond affirmatively to their invitations. Reach out to friends who are active in NGO and CSO work. The assistance of these institutions have been crucial in disaster risk management, response, and rehabilitation work. They are likewise critical partners in social welfare programs that otherwise your office cannot handle effectively. More importantly, they are a rich source of grounded data and support for your advocacies.

Tapping or engaging them in the implementation of small community projects may also be helpful. However, be mindful of existing Commission on Audit (COA) accounting and auditing rules and regulations when involving NGOs and CSOs in your projects.

**7.4 Engaging the Private Sector and the Academe**

Similar to efforts to maintain good relationships with NGOs and CSOs, do establish networks with the private sector and the academe. You may consider visiting them occasionally in their respective establishments. Dialogue with them on shared issues and concerns, and the issues that they are studying. It may be helpful to inform them about the workings of the Parliament and provide updates on the recent policies and developments in the Bangsamoro Government.

**7.5 Engaging the Security Sector**

In support of peace and stability-enhancing initiatives, it would be beneficial to strengthen relationships with the local units of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), the Philippine National Police (PNP) and other established peace mechanisms on the ground. If you are from the mainland, try to reach out to the 6th Infantry Division, AFP officials at Awang, Datu Odin Sinsuat, Maguindanao del Norte, and at the Police Regional Office-Bangsamoro Autonomous Region at Camp General Salipada K. Pendatun in Parang, Maguindanao del Norte. If you represent a district in any of the island provinces, connect with the West Mindanao Command at Camp Navarro, Upper Calarian, Zamboanga City. Communicate constantly with your friends in the AFP, PNP, MILF and MNLF to establish a solid network with the security sector. Attend the activities which you may be invited to.

This network of relationships will be helpful, especially in providing humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. The AFP and the PNP have the pool of resources, especially manpower and transportation assets, that are readily available.

**7.6 Engaging Development Partners**

The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is blessed to have the support and assistance of various funding institutions. Often referred to as development partners, these institutions include bilateral and multilateral donors as well as international NGOs. A number of them have been operating in the area even prior to the creation of the Bangsamoro, and have invested resources for capacity building both at the regional level and in specific LGUs.

Bilateral partners in the Bangsamoro include the Australian Government; Japan (through the JICA or Japan International Cooperation Agency); Canada; Spain through their Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation; the United States through the United States Agency for International Development; the United Kingdom; New Zealand; and the European Union. While most of these donors have a development mandate, others are also involved in the peace process architecture, such as the governments of Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, and Norway.

Multilateral institutions include The World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the United Nations (UN) and its agencies. Some UN agencies with a long history of collaboration with the Bangsamoro and the former ARMM include the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Children’s Fund, the United Nations-World Food Programme, the International Labor Organization, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, and the International Organization for Migration.

Bilateral partners often course their support through multiple international NGOs. Notable NGOs that have participated and supported the peace process include The Asia Foundation, Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, Conciliation Resources, and a broad ecosystem of smaller groups with specific mandates, including humanitarian response.

Those who have specific engagements in Parliament include the European Union through the SUBATRA Project, which is co-funded by the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation, the World Bank, and the JICA through the Public Finance Management Project, among others. Participate in the activities and trainings sponsored by these development partners, especially if they are aligned with your advocacies. At the very least, your interest and cooperation will strengthen their commitment to support your agenda, and the goals of the Bangsamoro in general.

**7.7 Coalition-building**

If you are not yet part of any political party, consider establishing a new one. This, however, requires resources especially human resource, money, and the support of a network or organization. Planning for this entails a survey and analysis of the dynamics and network of relationships of MPs. Be constantly aware that 40 seats in Parliament is equivalent to fifty percent (50%) of the total number of seats.

If you already belong to a political party, take note of all the candidates and the eventual winners. The more important details are party affiliations and their political allies, supporters in the national government, national and internal networks, regional parties, and other important personalities. You, your staff, and allies should be able to do the following alliance-building measures:

a) Analyze their profile, organizations, aspirations, and advocacies;
b) Pinpoint potential allies based on aspirations, advocacies and political inclination;
c) Identify potential MPs or personalities who could help in alliance building;
d) Initiate small caucuses, then gradually expand;
e) Informally discuss coalition-building;
f) Formalize when all concerns are addressed and documented;
g) Formally launch alliance building activities;
h) Promote alliance building; and
i) Expand the alliance, when necessary.

Understand these internal and external processes, embrace them, and apply what you learn as you go along.

**Study Your Environment**

The first three (3) months of your new career as an MP are crucial to understanding, discerning, and internalizing the systems and processes, both technically, and administratively. The fastest way to understand your new environment is to talk to someone who is familiar with the workings of the Parliament, whether a senior MP, a former MP, or a former Chief of Staff of an MP. Try and find any of them to informally brief you over a cup of coffee. Make this learning light through conversation. Clarify administrative and legislative concerns and find out who you need to deal with and who can assist you in navigating internal systems and processes.

Recruiting competent staff with adequate experience is critical. Do not fall into the trap of hiring relatives just because they need jobs. Hire qualified personnel. As for technical concerns, understand the nature of your job and the environment you are in and read up on parliamentary procedures. If you are not familiar with the historical background of the Bangsamoro region, get in touch with reputable academics and NGOs and ask for a briefing.

Moreover, there are unwritten norms in the Parliament. You can learn about these by keenly observing or talking to colleagues. The existence of groupings amongst the members are at once a reflection of the diversity of the environment outside the Parliament as they are also reflective of the natural human tendency to band together to gain strength and influence within the Parliament. These groupings could be based on party affiliations, established friendships, commonly-held advocacies, and many others. These groups sometimes adopt a name for themselves. In the first BTA, there was the ‘minority group’ and the ‘youth group,’ and in the second BTA, there are the ‘Miracle 5,’ the ‘Women’s Informal Caucus,’ and the ‘Island Group.’ These informal labels exist aside from the already established MILF and MNLF organizations, which are formally recognized in the BOL. Be mindful that there are formal leaders in the Parliament and there are also respected individuals who may not necessarily be officers or are part of the leadership. Try to determine as much as possible who they are, while also attempting to establish linkages with them. If there are open invitations for informal gatherings, find time for them, and use these opportunities to build and strengthen links with the leaders and other MPs.

**PART II**
**Legislation**

**8 Understanding the Process of Legislation**

Legislation is a major component of an MP’s duties. This encompasses the following critical activities: defining your agenda and corresponding priority measures, studying existing laws and the reforms that need to be undertaken, drafting priority measures, defending these measures, and generally bringing your constituency’s agenda to all possible platforms of the Bangsamoro government. It will seem difficult at first, but constant exposure to parliamentary work will shorten the learning curve.

**8.1 Legislation and its Significance**

Legislation is the process of crafting laws and policy measures. Essentially, legislation comes in the form of bills and resolutions. Bills, when they pass the legislative process, become part of the laws of the Bangsamoro. On the other hand, resolutions express the sentiment of the Parliament about certain concerns but they do not become law. Bills can authorize the utilization of funds, while resolutions cannot.

Legislative policymaking gives legal effect to policies. Legislation is a higher form of law since it can modify, amend, or rescind other previous laws passed by the Bangsamoro Parliament and orders, resolutions, and ordinances issued by the subordinate authorities.

Among other benefits, legislation shapes and directs the actions of government; defines the accountabilities of persons, institutions, entities including the government; helps ensure the maintenance of law and order; defines the bureaucracy and its services; guides regional offices and agencies and LGUs in the administration of their affairs; provides for the rules that regulate the utilization of natural resources and protect the environment; and defines the allocation and utilization of funds.

Through legislation, the processes that build a just and humane society, and those that ensure the promotion of national security, are put to work.

**8.2 Orientation and Training About Parliamentary Rules**

With the exception of those who have previously served in Congress or in the former Regional Legislative Assembly of the ARMM, few MPs have hands-on experience as legislators. It would be advantageous to the neophyte MP to undergo an orientation on legislative policymaking and the requirements of effective representation. Usually, the Parliament offers programs for orientation and training of MPs in coordination with development partners. Grab these opportunities for yourself and your staff. Even an experienced or returning MP can gain valuable insights especially about revised policies, rules, and other developments at the national level, and the parliamentary setup in other countries. You may also view the recording of previous masterclasses conducted during the first BTA that are available in the Parliament’s digital library.

Be open to opportunities for you and other MPs to observe the workings of other Parliaments, and encourage the leadership of the Parliament to provide avenues for such. A wealth of knowledge may be derived from such visits and study tours, such as those related to budgeting and budget defense, representation and constituency servicing, peace initiatives, and development planning.

**8.3 Getting Involved in the Committees**

As mentioned in the previous chapter, there are two (2) types of committees: the Statutory and Parliamentary. Currently, there are 17 Statutory Committees and seven (7) Parliamentary Committees.

At the national level, Congressional committees are considered the “workhorses” of the legislature because it is during their deliberations that the opinions of various stakeholders on proposed measures are surfaced, reforms that are acceptable to stakeholders are shaped, and consequently, support for these reforms are rallied and secured. Committees act like sieves. The committees are meant to sift through the technical details of proposed legislation and to examine each provision against the prevailing social context. Thus, it is at the committee level where the most important aspects of a reform are determined and crafted accordingly.

Participate actively in the committees where you think you can significantly contribute, especially those where your background and experience may be useful. Be conscientious in tracking the status of the bills you authored in the committees that they were referred to. The Secretariat of these committees and the respective Committee Chairpersons will be instrumental in facilitating the processing of your bills. Explore opportunities that will allow you to put your agenda forward in committee meetings and in the plenary sessions. Remember, attendance and active participation pay off.

**8.4 Rules Application is Key to Fast Learning**

Learn to continuously apply the Rules and observe procedures and parliamentary practices. You may need to simulate, when necessary. Ask the assistance of your colleagues or your staff if there are gray areas in the Rules that you wish to seek clarification on. Practice makes perfect. Just be patient.

**9 Defining Priority Measures**

Your priority measures should reflect who you are and what matters to you and your constituents. Given the priorities of the Government of the Day (GOTD) and the national government, you need to identify and define the topmost priorities that you want to spend your limited time and resources on.

**9.1 Agenda-setting Based on Needs and Identified Policy Gaps**

Depending on your background and constituency, identify your preferred interest or agenda. Among many other issues that may need legislation, there may be a general clamor in your area for climate change mitigation, disaster risk reduction, environmental safeguards, non-Moro indigenous peoples’ welfare, settler communities’ protection, youth empowerment, or women’s rights. Ideally, focusing on an area related to your background or expertise will facilitate your efforts in building credibility and help you gain public trust more easily.

The review of existing national and BARMM laws in relation to your interest may help in your agenda-setting. The staff, with your guidance, may work on this to determine the gaps in policy. Start with basic ideas, national and BARMM priorities, and current issues.

The websites of the Senate, House of Representatives, and the Bangsamoro Parliament are major references in determining areas in need of legislation and reform. Of much value to researchers are the publications of the House Secretariat on their recommendations for legislation, and the budget notes published by the Congressional Planning and Budget Research Department. Copies of these documents may be obtained upon request. Triangulate these pieces of valuable information with the clamor of your constituents, and the priority thrusts of the GOTD. This will help define what is most important and what deserves your attention in your work in the Parliament.

**9.2 Agenda-setting with the Staff**

After obtaining initial data from the review of existing national and BARMM laws and other significant information, you may conduct planning exercises with your staff to firm up your agenda. Identify your development goals, examine the current situation, then identify the corresponding reforms that ought to be legislated. Note that there may be interventions that can be made by the Executive; in these instances, there may be a need to lobby the Cabinet for changes in administrative policy. A simple resolution seeking these changes may be in order. After the list of legislative reforms are identified, integrate them into a coherent agenda that addresses your development goals. Afterwards, this may be communicated to your constituency and the general public.

Figure 8 shows an example of an MP’s development agenda. Figure 9 shows a sample agenda with corresponding legislative priorities based on the ideas that were consolidated from the requirements of the BOL, the Bangsamoro Development Plan, the socio-economic situation of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, and the personal advocacy of the MP.

**10 How to Come Up with Bills and Resolutions**

Now that you’ve identified your reform agenda for your three-year term as an MP, you need to translate them into specific legislative measures.

**10.1 Translate Ideas into Bills or Resolutions**

**10.1.1 What is a bill?**
A bill is a proposed measure, or amendment or repeal of an existing law, presented to the Parliament for its consideration. There are three (3) kinds of bills, namely a government bill, private member bill, and popular initiative (Secs. 1-2, Rule XVII, AR No. 268).

A government bill refers to a legislative initiative that the Government of the Day (GOTD) submits to the Parliament for approval or amendment. If the Members of the Parliamentary Committee, subcommittee, special committee, ad hoc and ad hoc joint committee, as a result of meetings, hearings, public consultations, investigations and inquiry discover the need to pass a new law or amend or revise an existing law, they may, in the first instance, persuade the concerned Member of the Cabinet to draft the bill. Such bill shall be presented to the Chief Minister and the Cabinet and if it passes their approval, the legislative measure shall be introduced by the GOTD as a Government bill.

Private member bill refers to a legislative initiative introduced by a Member of the Parliament who is not a Minister for approval or amendment. Figure 10 is an example of a private member bill.

Government bills shall have precedence over private member bills without prejudice to consolidation.

A popular initiative refers to the process whereby a bill is proposed directly by the people as part of participatory democracy in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. The processing of popular initiatives are covered by guidelines.

**10.1.2 What is the structure of a bill?**

Sec. 7, Rule XVII of AR No. 268 describes the structure of a bill, namely: 1) Explanatory Statement, 2) Number, 3) Title, 4) Sponsor, 5) Enacting Clause, 6) Body of the Bill, 7) Amendment and Revision, 8) Separability Clause, and 9) Effectivity (see Box 5).

**Box 5. Bill Structure**
**Section 7, Rule XVII, AR No. 268**

**(A) Explanatory Statement; Optional.** Explanatory statement sets out the purposes or reasons for introducing the bill.

**(B) Number.** Number refers to the assigned number as to the order it is received by the Office of the Secretary-General of the Parliament.

**(C) Title.** Title spells out the purpose of the bill in general terms and must accurately reflect its contents.

**(D) Sponsor.** Sponsor refers to the author or authors who introduce the bill in the Parliament and whose names are enumerated therein. They shall sign the bill as Sponsors.

**(E) Enacting Clause.** Enacting clause states the authority under which the bill will be enacted.
Example: Be it enacted by the Parliament in session assembled.

**(F) Body of the Bill.** Body of the bill is broken into Rules and Sections, each of which is numbered in Roman and Arabic numerals, respectively. A section may have more than one (1) paragraph. It may contain sub-sections which are sequentially lettered. Likewise, a sub-section may have more than one (1) paragraph.

**(G) Amendment and Revision.** A bill may contain an amendatory or revision clause which shall modify, improve, or supersede an existing law. If a bill proposes to amend or revise an existing law, the title must mention the law being amended or revised.

**(H) Separability Clause.** A bill contains a separability clause which states that if any portion or provision of the law is declared unlawful or unconstitutional, other sections or provisions which are not affected by such declaration shall continue to be in full force and effect.

**(I) Effectivity.** Effectivity clause is the final section of a bill which announces when it shall take effect.

**10.1.3 What is a resolution?**

A resolution is a document expressing the sentiment or opinion of the Parliament. It does not create or modify a law (Sec. 4, Rule XVII, AR 268). There are three (3) types of resolutions filed in the Parliament: simple resolution, concurrent resolution, and joint committee resolution.

A simple resolution is a measure used by the Parliament to take action affecting its own procedures, urgent resolution requiring immediate action by the Parliament, or to express an opinion, sympathy or commendation.’ Figure 11 is an example of a simple resolution.

On the other hand, a concurrent resolution is a resolution issued concurrently by both the Bangsamoro Cabinet and the Parliament expressing their sentiments on certain matters. Figure 12 shows as an example of a concurrent resolution filed in the House of Representatives.

A joint committee resolution is a resolution of two (2) or more committees expressing the will or action of the Members on certain matters. This requires the majority vote of all the committees concerned (Sec. 5, Rule XVII, AR No. 268).

**10.1.4 What is the form of a proposed resolution?**

Sec. 8, Rule XVII of AR No. 268 describes the form of a proposed resolution, namely: 1) Number, 2) Authors, 3) Title, 4) Body, and 5) Final Statement of the Proposed Resolution (refer to Box 6).

To ensure consistency and clarity of purpose, the title and resolutory clause of a resolution must, as much as possible, use the same wording.

**Box 6. Proposed Resolution Form**
**Sec. 8, Rule XVII, AR No. 268**

**(A) Number.** Number refers to the assigned number as to the order it is received by the Office of the Secretary-General of the Parliament.

**(B) Authors.** The Authors introduce the proposed resolution in the Parliament and their names shall be enumerated therein. They shall sign the proposed resolution.

**(C) Title.** Title spells out the purpose of the proposed resolution and must accurately reflect its contents.

**(D) Body.** The body contains the ‘Whereas Clauses’ which present the justifications or reasons for the proposed resolution.

**(E) Final Statement of the Proposed Resolution.** This contains the specific sentiments or opinions expressed by the authors and as may be adopted by the Parliament.

**10.2 Get Ideas Everywhere**

There are various means of determining what reforms need to be legislated. The provisions of the BOL are definitive sources of subject matters that require legislation. Informal discussions with friends, colleagues, Bangsamoro residents in your constituency, and other stakeholders that you interact with could bring you closer to the pulse, so to speak, of the general public. Focus group discussions with particular sectors could be fertile ground from which you can harvest both technical information and insights. Your office may also introduce innovative ways to generate ideas such as through fora and workshops, where various experts and stakeholders can discuss and exchange ideas, even opposing views. Assign a legal officer to review the Bangsamoro Autonomy Acts and Resolutions (these are available in the website of the Bangsamoro Parliament). Be mindful also of the current events affecting the Bangsamoro region that require immediate legislative measures from the Parliament.

Moreover, continuously send your staff to bill drafting trainings, issue-based seminars and briefings, and other related activities. This can help sharpen their skills, improve their outputs, and keep their work up to standard.

**11 How to Author Legislation**

An MP who files a measure is considered its author. An MP has the choice of filing a measure as its principal author, co-principal author or co-author. Aside from the principal author or authors, all of those who manifest their interest are referred to as co-authors.

If you are the principal author of a measure, you are obliged to defend it before the committee to which it is referred. In your absence, your co-principal author or any of the co-authors may defend your measure. You could also be a co-principal author or co-author of the legislative measures introduced by other MPs either by invitation or by an approved motion, as long as there are no objections from the respective MPs. During plenary sessions, there are available forms that you could fill out to seek co-authorship.

On the other hand, when an amendment you made to a resolution or bill is significant, you automatically become a principal author or co-author of that measure. This is part of the BTA’s unwritten rules. But be mindful: as an author, you have the obligation to understand the full implications of the measure on society and governance once it is implemented. It must be underscored that as co-author, you cannot oppose any of the provisions of the measure when it is deliberated upon by the Parliament in plenary session.

One very important aspect of crafting a bill is determining its funding requirement for human resources, administrative, and operational costs. Begin with asking yourself: how much will it cost the Bangsamoro Government if this bill were to be implemented? This means that even before affixing your name and signature on a bill, there should have been some kind of assessment, completed staff work, or feasibility assessment regarding implementation.

It must be noted that the BOL provides for a budget cap. Specifically, it provides that not more than 45 percent (45%) of the block grant may be allocated for personnel services (PS). It is best to determine first how much is required to support the PS, maintenance and other operating expenses (MOOE), and capital outlay (CO) requirements of a proposed measure.

The next question to ask is if your proposal is sustainable. For example, before you file a bill seeking the construction of a 50-bed hospital in a certain municipality, you and your staff must determine how much is required based on the Ministry of Health’s standards to establish, operate, and sustain the facility. How many health workers are needed to meet the standards of operating a 50-bed hospital? What are the implications of creating this new structure in relation to the funding requirements of other programs of Bangsamoro ministries, offices, and agencies (BMOAs)? The block grant is not unlimited—any funded priority legislation must necessarily take from resources that would otherwise be utilized for equally important expenditures. Taking stock of these considerations will lessen the chances of your bill languishing in the legislative mill, or worse, becoming an unfunded mandate.

Indeed, the responsibilities of a legislator cannot be overemphasized. Being a conscientious legislator is not about the quantity of bills and resolutions an MP files or co-authors. Proper and authentic legislation should be driven by the necessity of its passage, and always for the common good.

**12 How to Rally Support for Legislative Measures**

Once filed, your bill or resolution will be referred eventually to the appropriate committee. As the author of a measure, the committee will invite you to present your proposal in a meeting called for the purpose. This is the opportunity where you can convince your peers to come onboard, so to speak, and support your bill or resolution. The matter of scheduling a measure for committee deliberation is entirely the prerogative of the committee, so it would be best to seek the Committee Chairperson’s support to put your bill in the committee’s Order of Business. Most committees plan their meeting schedule way ahead because committee arrangements require considerable coordination and staff work.

Committees require a quorum to conduct business. Under the Parliament’s Rules, the quorum requirement is 30% of committee membership. To secure committee approval of a measure, it would be important to get the support of committee members prior to the meeting. You may also request them to attend the meeting so the quorum requirement is met.

Make sure that you secure the support of the GOTD, otherwise, your measure can face opposition which, if unattended or not dealt with early on, may be insurmountable. Finally, prepare a list of experts on the subject matter of the bill or resolution, and suggest to the Chairperson or Secretariat that these experts be invited to comment on the measure.

If the committee approves the measure, the Rules require the committee to file a committee report. It is best that your staff coordinate with the committee staff in charge of drafting it.

Upon filing, the committee report will be placed in the Order of Business for plenary consideration. As author, you may assist the Committee Chairperson in defending the legislative measure. In this case, an author of a measure becomes a co-sponsor of the committee report.

**12.1 Stages of Legislation**

Under Sec. 2, Rule XVIII, AR No. 268, a legislative measure undergoes three readings, namely: 1) First Reading, 2) Second Reading, and 3) Third Reading. The stages of legislation are illustrated in Figure 13 and described in Box 7.

The readings of a measure are conducted at the plenary level. The First Reading is where the proposed bill is introduced to the plenary by reading of the number and title of the measure, and the authors thereof. After the sponsorship speech is given at the start of the Second Reading, the Speaker refers the proposed bill to the appropriate committee, which then examines, scrutinizes, and deliberates on the bill in detail. The committee shall conduct public consultations and hearings, and will invite submissions of policy papers and proposals from interested stakeholders and experts. The public consultation stage is where various interest groups for or against a specific measure are able to participate in the process of legislation. Particularly for contentious bills and provisions, these consultations should be managed in a way that the points-of-view of all parties are heard.

After it approves a measure, the committee files the appropriate committee report which is then placed in the Order of Business of the plenary. During plenary sessions, MPs must deliberate on the proposed legislation, using the committee report as the basis for deliberation and debate. Plenary consideration of the committee report includes the period of interpellation and debate, period of amendments, and approval on Second Reading.

**Box 7. Stages of Legislation**
**Sec. 2, Rule XVIII, AR No. 268**

**(A) First Reading.** The Secretary-General shall report all bills and resolutions to the Parliament for First Reading. The First Reading shall involve only the reading of the number, title, and author of the bill or resolution, followed by a declaration of the Speaker whether the bill is a Government bill or a Private Member bill. If the bill is a Private Member bill, the author may propose the inclusion of additional authors by making the appropriate request to the Majority Floor Leader.

**(B) Second Reading.** A bill or resolution on Second Reading shall be read in full unless copies thereof have been distributed to the Members. The proponent shall deliver his/her authorship speech which is the explanatory statement of his/her bill or resolution. Thereafter, the bill shall be referred to the appropriate committee by the Majority Floor Leader.

The Chairperson of a Committee to which a bill or resolution is referred may make a written request to the Committee on Rules for a change of referral of such bill or resolution, citing the grounds therefor. The Committee on Rules shall decide on the request within five (5) days from receipt thereof.

**(C) Committee Stage.** At this stage, the concerned committee shall examine, scrutinize and deliberate in detail and line by line the legislative proposal. It may consult, invite, and solicit opinions from experts, relevant ministries and offices, the public and other interested parties.

The committee concerned may propose amendments or revisions to the proposal, and if there are no changes made, the bill is deemed submitted to the next stage. The Committee shall then render a report on the bill to the plenary.

**(D) Consideration and Deliberation Stage.** The Members of the Parliament shall deliberate and debate on the committee report, including proposed amendments, if there are any, in the plenary session, except when the proponent has already agreed to adopt the committee amendments. If the proponent of the committee report does not accept the amendments, the period of amendment continues, and he/she can propose his/her own amendments. This is called the Committee Amendments which refer to the alterations, modifications, and changes made or proposed to be made to the bill that is offered by the proponent.

Individual Members can also propose an amendment. This is called individual or Floor Amendments, which refers to any alteration, modification, and change made or proposed to be made to the bill by other Members of the Parliament.

Both the committee amendments and individual or floor amendments shall be debated and voted upon.

**(E) Third Reading or Final Stage.** During the Third Reading or Final Stage, there shall be final debate on whether or not to pass the bill. No amendment can be considered at this time. The proponent of the bill or author of the motion shall have the right to close the debate.

During the voting, the Majority Floor Leader shall only read the title of the bill, provided that printed copies of the bill shall have been distributed to the Members of the Parliament at least three (3) days before voting ensues. However, in case of a certified bill or emergency bill, the three (3) days requirement herein is waived and the voting can be done on the same day the bill is approved on Third Reading.

The Speaker shall ask for a roll call vote by show of hands or by standing or sitting, provided that any Member who wishes to abstain shall verbally manifest his abstention, without the need of explanation.

**(F) Approval of the Bill.** After going through the stages herein provided, the printed form of the approved bill shall be signed by the Speaker and the Chief Minister.

**(G) Effectivity.** The enacted law shall take effect after fifteen (15) days following its complete publication in at least one (1) newspaper of general circulation within the BARMM.

Upon the direction of the Majority Floor Leader (MFL), and based on certain considerations, the deliberation of a committee report may be suspended temporarily, usually when additional details need to be ironed out at the committee level.

Once the measure is approved on Second Reading, the Secretariat will proceed with engrossment, which is the process of incorporating all the amendments and changes made during deliberations.

The engrossed bill is then printed then sent back to the Floor for consideration on Third Reading.

The engrossed copy of the bill must be provided to every member before the bill can be considered on Third Reading. Under the Rules, a minimum period of three (3) days is observed between approval on Second Reading and Third Reading, unless the passage of the bill is certified as urgent by the Chief Minister.

After approval on Third Reading, the measure is enrolled and sent by the Secretary-General to the Speaker and the Chief Minister for approval. The signed measure is then published in a newspaper of general circulation. The law subsequently takes effect fifteen (15) days after publication.

**12.2 The Most Crucial Stage of the Legislative Process**

In many respects, the most crucial stage of the legislative process is when a committee deliberates on a measure. You need to prepare for the date when your bill is calendared for committee consideration. Try to anticipate possible questions on any section of your bill or Whereas Clause of your resolution. Prepare questions of your own, and work with your staff to draft appropriate responses. Informally, try to scope out potential interpellators and the likely questions they may ask based on their background and policy agenda.

You may also ask the Majority Floor Leader for the names of the MPs who have signified their intentions to interpellate the sponsors of the committee report. Reach out to them if you can, either personally or at staff level. As much as possible, anticipate their possible questions, so you could prepare answers. These kinds of informal dialogues will help both the proponent and the interpellator find common ground, smoothen the plenary process, and ideally help strengthen the final output. Legislative policymaking does not have to be adversarial: try to keep an open mind.

If you and your team have done your completed staff work (CSW), you can be confident in presenting and defending your proposal. Needless to say, only in-depth knowledge of the subject matter and a grasp of the measure’s technical, social, and budgetary implications will help you convince your colleagues about the necessity of its passage. Do your homework so you can dodge thorny issues and manage any perceptions or misgivings that stakeholders may have regarding your reform proposal.

**12.3 Lifelines to Tap**

There are support groups that may be available to assist you. Request your co-authors, if any, to help in defending your measure at the committee and plenary levels, and inform them in advance of meeting schedules so they can prepare. You may also call a small group caucus to discuss the matter. You do not have to defend the bill or resolution alone. The presence of support groups and co-authors during the meeting will bolster appreciation of the measure.

**12.4 Dry Run and Other Tactics**

If you are a new MP and you get the first-time jitters when called upon to present your proposed measure, executing dry runs may help. As they say, ‘practice makes perfect’. There is no better tool or success formula than diligent preparation. Prepare for all possible scenarios. Your staff and colleagues can pinpoint areas of strengths and weaknesses.

If you cannot answer a Member’s questions immediately, assure the Speaker that you will do so later in the proceedings. Alternatively, you may request the Member to introduce an amendment in the proper time. You may also request the Speaker for a suspension of the session. Only as an extreme measure, the Majority Floor Leader may request for the deferment of the consideration of a legislative measure. The latter is not advisable, but it is also an option.

**13 How to Bring Your Agenda to the Table**

You can push for your priority agenda even during the deliberations of bills and resolutions filed by other MPs. How do you do that?

**13.1 The Order of Business**

As a general rule, the Secretariat furnishes the MPs with the Order of Business (OB) at least three (3) days from the meeting or session. Once you get a copy of the OB, determine the measures that you are interested in. Ask your staff to review the related laws, issuances, data, and other information regarding the measure that will be discussed either at the committee or plenary level.

**13.2 The Order of Business of a Committee Meeting**

If you are interested in certain bills or resolutions that are scheduled for deliberation at the committee level, make sure you study the specific concerns you want to introduce. Try to anticipate and list possible questions as well as proposed amendments. Make sure your questions are incisive and invite discussion and debate. Based on the answers of the proponent, state for the record that you wish to propose amendments at the proper time.

Introduce your amendments one by one during the period of amendments. If it is a resolution that is being deliberated upon, discuss the amendments you wish to introduce and refer to the specific Whereas Clauses. If it is a bill, state your proposed amendment based on the sections being discussed.

Amendments to the title of a resolution or bill are considered last. If your proposed amendment is accepted, then thank the author. If your proposals are not accepted, you have the option to seek a division of the house, or to just accept the position of the proponent.

If the Committee Chairperson decides to divide the house, then be ready to win or lose. Accept whatever is the decision of the committee; even if you lose in the vote, at least your position on a particular subject has been recorded.

The other option is to submit a position paper to the committee. The committee is bound to include your proposal in its deliberation, whether you are a Member or non-Member.

**13.3 The Order of Business at the Plenary Level**

The same process is observed at the plenary level. The flow of the deliberation is controlled by the Majority Floor Leader and the Presiding Officer. You have to attentively follow the discussion on a measure. Remember that there are 79 other Members who similarly wish to take the Floor and who compete for the chance to introduce amendments during the session.

**14 Process Management**

In the earlier chapters, we introduced the idea of engaging the internal environment of the Bangsamoro Parliament, as well as external stakeholders and partners at the local, regional, national, and even international arenas. Once you have a general understanding of your operating environment and the many internal processes involved, you need to manage these processes (see Figure 14).

As an MP, a lot of these decisions are technical and administrative, but may also require a keen understanding of yourself and your relationships with others. You will need to balance the push-and-pull of internal and external factors, and to respond to urgent tasks while keeping a long-term perspective. It is not always easy, but it is possible.

**14.1 Managing Internal Processes**

**14.1.1 Technical Processes**

**A. The MP’s Office and Parliament Operations**
As an MP, your own technical staff is expected to assist you in drafting legislative measures, including the crafting of amendments that you can propose at the committee and plenary levels. You may seek the assistance of the Parliament’s Policy Research and Legal Services (PRLS) for research and legal matters. You can also tap the Legislative Technical Affairs and Information Services (LTAIS) for the media relations requirements of your office.

Your office is required to prepare at least an annual report based on the work and financial plan and the legislative monitoring matrix that you have prepared for the fiscal year. Copies of the report shall be submitted to the Speaker. You may wish to furnish the Office of the Chief Minister (OCM), the offices of the MPs, and relevant national and international partners a copy of the report.

**B. Legislative Function**
This involves various processes starting with the drafting of a measure, filing of the measure, consultations with stakeholders, committee deliberations, and plenary deliberations.

**Filing of legislative measures.** Bills and resolutions are filed in the Bills and Index Division (BID) of the Parliament. The BID assigns a number to the bill or resolution and stamps that number on the copies filed. Under existing procedure, an MP has to submit one paper copy and an electronic copy of the measure to the BID.

**Inclusion in the Order of Business (OB).** The legislative process begins when your proposed legislative measure is included in the OB. At the committee level, the OB is prepared by the Secretariat in consultation with the Committee Chairperson.

At the plenary level, the OB is prepared by the Secretariat based on the guidance of the Majority Leader and the Speaker. According to the Parliament’s rules, the daily OB of the plenary session shall have 13 parts as shown in Box 8.

**Box 8. Order of Business**
**Section 1, Rule VIII, AR No. 268**

a. Call to Order;
b. Invocation or Prayer;
c. National Anthem;
d. Bangsamoro Hymn;
e. Roll Call;
f. Reading and Approval of Journal of the Previous Session;
g. Reference of Business:
    1. Bills on First Reading; and
    2. Resolutions, Messages, Memorials and Communications;
h. Bills on Second Reading:
    1. Committee Reports on Bills;
    2. Period of Interpellations;
    3. Period of Amendments; and
    4. Approval of Second Reading.
i. Resolutions Referred to the Committee:
    1. Committee Reports;
    2. Period of Interpellations;
    3. Period of Amendments; and
    4. Approval.
j. Unfinished Business;
k. Privilege Hour (refer to Rule IX);
l. Question Hour (refer to Rule XI); and
m. Bills on Third Reading.

On the first Wednesday of every quarter, the Order of Business shall include the Chief Minister’s Hour immediately after the Roll Call.

In case of a Special Session, the Order of Business as communicated shall be strictly in accordance with the purpose of the request of the Chief Minister or the order of the Speaker (Sec. 1, Rule VIII, AR No. 268).

The daily Order of Business shall be posted on the websites of the Parliament and sent through electronic mail to the Members. As far as practicable, such Order of Business shall be sent at least three (3) days before the commencement of session (Sec. 2, Rule VIII, AR No. 268).

Any Member of the Parliament may, after the Roll Call, move for an amendment of the Order of Business. If no amendment is raised, it shall be deemed adopted (Sec. 3, Rule VIII, AR No. 268).

**Dissenting opinions.** You will, at some point, inevitably disagree with your colleagues. This can happen during committee meetings, plenary sessions, and even in special caucuses called by the Speaker or the GOTD leadership. In situations like these, be mindful of the Rules, maintain decorum, and always respect the leaders and your colleagues. However, do not let external pressures suppress your freedom of speech. Do not be afraid to speak out or disagree. You can even trigger a discussion through your concerns.

In doing so, you ensure that the best ideas of all MPs are put forward. This can encourage debate, a clearer view of the issue, the joining of the issues, the facilitation of consensus-building, or the finding a middle ground. Should there be future questions of law, the documentation of your views and your colleagues will guide others in determining the intent of the framers of the law.

**Debates.** Although the term “debates” often brings to mind images of adversarial and overstretched discussions, this process actually aims to constructively flesh out ideas and other important points for everybody to consider. Always address your questions to the Speaker or the Presiding Officer, and not to the MP proponent or Committee Chairperson that is defending a particular measure. During debates at the committee and plenary levels, you can manifest your reservations at any time if you disagree with a proposition. You can even propose for the division of the house during the period of amendments when your proposal is not accepted. However, building a consensus among the MPs on the measure or on any issue is more facilitative.

One way that the heated debate and tension in committee meetings or plenary deliberations are defused is through a suspension of the proceedings. If it occurs during a plenary session, the Floor Leader can request the Speaker or Presiding Officer for a suspension of the session. A brief suspension will allow the contending parties to talk and clarify issues. This is best facilitated by the Presiding Officer and the Floor Leader.

Similarly, during a committee meeting, it is the Chairperson or the Presiding Officer who steers the discussion and ensures that it stays on point. Part of this role is the responsibility to ensure that time given to MPs who wish to speak is fair and equitable, and to defuse tension when the discussions on contentious issues become caustic or unruly. Under the Rules, no MP shall speak more than once during the same day on the same question or motion. This ensures that others have the equal opportunity to do so.

**Committee Reports.** The committees act as “little legislatures” and it is in the committee that a bill is examined for its scope, purpose, and viability. Meetings and hearings are scheduled to deliberate on the measures referred to the committees. Substantial revisions usually occur at the committee level. Committee members and staff are usually experts on the subject matters covered by a committee’s jurisdiction.

A committee may dispose of a measure through one of several ways: it may approve the measure with or without amendment and report it out, rewrite it entirely, or reject it altogether. The committee report on a measure contains the recommendations of the committee, whether to approve with or without amendment. A copy of the original measure forms part of the committee report. If the committee decides to amend a substantial part of the original measure, a copy of the amended bill is also attached to the committee report. Copies of committee reports are circulated by the Secretariat at least three (3) days before they are scheduled for deliberation on the Floor.

**Rules mastery.** The Presiding Officer and the Floor Leader need to master the Rules because they oversee the flow of the discussion on the Floor. Under the Rules, an MP could call the attention of the Presiding Officer by raising a “point of order.” This is necessary when the discussion veers away from the agenda or when an MP obtains the Floor for concerns other than those that are being discussed. Checking the process during committee or plenary discussions is an attribute of a good MP and, when done devoid of malintent to delay or derail the discussion, is a sign of conscientiousness.

Moreover, during voting, the Presiding Officer cannot vote unless there is a tie.

**C. Oversight Function**

One of the important roles of an MP is to oversee the performance of the government through the exercise of the oversight function of Parliament. Oversight is essentially carried out through the review and assessment of the affairs of the Executive in order to check the latter’s compliance with the law in the implementation of policies, programs and projects. It is an inherent power of the Parliament within a functioning democracy.

Oversight can be performed in various ways. A committee may conduct oversight hearings which usually take the mode of an inquiry in aid of legislation. The administrative and technical processes observed by the Parliament’s Secretariat in committee hearings and inquiries in aid of legislation are important elements in the exercise of the oversight function. This includes the preparation of invitations, preparation and service of subpoena, the administration of the oath to witnesses, the proper safekeeping of evidence received during the committee hearing, the safekeeping of transcripts of proceedings until they are officially transmitted to the archives, and the coordination with BMOAs for the submission of documents requested by the committee, among others. Important resource persons and witnesses may also be invited by the committee and the leadership when the Parliament discusses a committee report on an inquiry in plenary session.

A discussion of this important function can be found in Part 3 of this guide.

**14.1.2 Administrative Processes**

**A. The MP's Office and Parliament Operations**

**The operations of an MP’s office.** The MP’s office operates within the administrative and financial structure of the Parliament under the leadership of the Speaker. The responsibilities of administrative and financial signatories are provided under civil service regulations, government accounting and auditing rules, and circulars issued by the Speaker.

**Supervision over the Operations of Parliament.** The Parliament’s operation is under the supervision and control of the Speaker. The administration of the Secretariat of the Parliament is exercised by the Secretary-General who is elected by the Members.

**Human resource management.** The Human Resource Management Division oversees the hiring of regular employees and the staff of MPs. The Speaker is the appointing authority for all staff, except those holding salary grade 25 level positions and above, as well as job order personnel hired by MPs. The recruitment and promotion of personnel is governed by the rules and regulations of the Civil Service Commission and existing law.

**Financial management.** The Finance Services handles all financial transactions related to the operation of Parliament. Funds are disbursed upon approval of the Speaker, based on the approved budget of the Parliament, and according to the listed objects of expenditures. These include the salaries and other benefits of MPs and their staff.

**Travel.** For official domestic or international travel, an MP must obtain from the Speaker a travel order for official domestic travel and a travel authority for international travel. Certain guidelines that pertain to the official travel and concomitant entitlements are stated in the authority to travel. The travel order of an MP’s staff is usually signed by the concerned MP, except when this pertains to Parliament’s in-house activities or are externally-funded activities covered by a travel order issued by the Speaker.

**Correspondence.** All correspondence pertaining to the office of individual MPs shall be addressed to the office of the MP. The Speaker issues circulars and memoranda for various activities, updates, and directives. These are circulated by the Records Management Division.

**B. Secretariat Support to Legislative Activities**

**Filing of legislative measures.** As discussed earlier, bills and resolutions are filed in the Bills and Index Division (BID). The BID stamps a number on the bill or resolution, which shall serve as its permanent number. The numbered measure will form part of the official records of the Parliament.

**Secretariat support to the committees and plenary sessions.** The Committee Support Service is in charge of managing all committee affairs. In line with this mandate, the unit assists the Committee Chairperson, Vice-Chairpersons and members. This office likewise undertakes staff work prior to the conduct of activities of the committee. On the other hand, the Plenary Support Service assists the Speaker, the Floor Leader and the MPs during plenary sessions, special sessions, and caucuses. Both services are led by Department Heads who are, in turn, supervised by the Secretary-General.

**Media relations.** The Legislative Technical Affairs and Information Service of the Parliament can assist an MP in media coverage and press relations through the Media Relations Division. For publicity and other media-related activities, the office of the MP may directly engage media service providers at their own expense.

**14.2 Managing External Processes**

**External partners.** The office of an MP engages external partners such as national government agencies, LGUs, CSOs, NGOs, the business sector, academe, and the security sector in connection with a particular issue or pending measure. Relations with these partners must be maintained and nurtured for the support that they can extend to the office of the MP.

**Lobby and interest groups.** As you conduct your legislative work as an MP, there could be lobby groups that may try to influence the phraseology of the provisions of a bill or the committee’s action on the measure. This may happen in both formal or informal settings, by individuals or groups. Lobbying is a respected profession in large democracies and is a way of measuring popular sentiment for a measure. There is no hard and fast rule for dealing with lobbies in Parliament, but the observance of moral guidelines should govern relations with lobby groups.

**Representation function.** An MP’s office is expected to render completed staff work to facilitate dealings with groups and an MP’s constituents. Depending on the need and plans of an MP, constituency servicing can mean a gamut of activities and can quite easily fill an MP’s calendar.

An expanded discussion on constituency services may be found in Part IV of this guide.

**Coalition-building.** The Bangsamoro Electoral Code allows political parties to coalesce. In coalition building, make sure that the party’s principles and aspirations are not compromised by what can be a mere desire to win the elections. Coalitions based on principle and a shared vision and perspective can be more enduring and transformational.

**15 Gender and the Women’s Agenda**

The “gender and development” concept was developed in the 1980s. As an alternative to the women in development approach, the gender and development (GAD) approach is not concerned specifically with women, but with the way in which a society assigns roles, responsibilities, and expectations to both men and women, boys and girls. The GAD analysis brings to fore the ways in which men and women work together, and is supposed to present results in neutral terms of economics and skill. This means that women are provided the same opportunities as men, including opportunities to participate in the public sphere. Therefore, in order to be gender-responsive, policies have to take into consideration the circumstances that affect men and women in different ways.

The Philippines is one of the more advanced countries in relation to gender and development policy and practice. GAD principles are enshrined in the Philippine Plan for Gender and Development 1995-2025, which is a national plan that addresses, provides and pursues full equality and development for men and women. Approved by former President Fidel V. Ramos as Executive Order No. 273 on September 8, 1995, it is the successor of the Philippine Development Plan for Women, 1989-1992 which was promulgated under Executive Order No. 348 issued on February 17, 1989. This has translated to good performance in global gender equality metrics.

The latest World Economic Forum (WEF) Global Gender Gap Index Report (GGGR) 2023 shows that the Philippines improved slightly in gender equality performance as it advanced three (3) spots – from 19th in 2022 to 16th place in 2023 among 146 countries, with 79.1% gender parity. Some key drivers behind this improvement are the Philippine Magna Carta for Women, a landmark law signed 14 years ago that seek to eliminate discrimination against women, as well as other instruments including the National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security (NAPWPS), which operationalizes UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325.

These global and national principles were considered in the drafting of the CAB and the BOL. Under the BOL, no person in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region shall be subjected to any form of discrimination on account of creed, religion, ethnic origin, parentage, or gender (Sec. 4, Art. IX). The Bangsamoro Government is committed to uphold and protect the fundamental rights of women, including the right to engage in lawful employment, and to be protected from exploitation, addition, abuse, or discrimination, as embodied in the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (Sec. 12, Art. IX). It shall also guarantee full and direct participation of women in governance and development process, ensuring that women shall benefit equally in the implementation of development programs and projects (Sec. 5, Art. XIII).

In consideration of these provisions of the BOL, the first BTA enacted the Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 8 or An Act Creating the Bangsamoro Women Commission (BWC) signed and approved on February 13, 2020. As mandated in the Bangsamoro Administrative Code, the Commission is the primary policy-making, coordinating, and monitoring body for all gender and development concerns in the BARMM.

The BWC shall promote, protect, and uphold women’s rights; work for the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women; ensure that legal measures are taken to promote gender justice, women’s rights and welfare; and promote gender and development including the meaningful participation of women in all levels of governance, policy and decision-making. To do so, the BWC and the Bangsamoro Government as a whole is tasked with localizing existing national GAD policies, including the preparation of an updated Bangsamoro Regional Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security (RAP-WPS), 2023-2028. The RAP-WPS was structured around UNSCR 1325’s four (4) strategic pillars of protection, participation, prevention, and relief and recovery. It also identified emerging trends and cross-cutting issues in the Bangsamoro such as cybersecurity, mental health and psychosocial support, and climate security.

Moreover, the Bangsamoro Government has its own Gender and Development agenda, which guides all of BMOAs in adhering to the GAD plans and budgets, as well as how legislators, local government units, and civil society organizations shall support GAD initiatives in the region. As an MP, you should be mindful of the provisions of the BOL on GAD and the current initiatives of the Bangsamoro Government on the promotion, protection, upholding of women’s rights, and elimination of all forms of discrimination against women. You may sponsor legislative measures that will help strengthen and clarify the provisions of the BOL on women as well as those that will improve the implementation of the RAP-WPS. This will also help in the protection of the human rights of women and girls, and the promotion of gender equality in the region—a region which is disaster-prone, is undergoing post-conflict transformation, and is striving to achieve the goals of the peace process. Your staff should also review the measures you intend to author or co-author to ensure that they are gender-responsive. Great effort should be exerted in reviewing the substance and style of provisions of these measures.

It is said that the true strength of a policy lies in the budget allocated for its implementation. Under the Bangsamoro Administrative Code, at least five percent (5%) of the total budget of each ministry, office, and constituent local government unit of the BARMM is earmarked for gender-responsive programs, in accordance with a gender and development plan. This is required by law. In the annual budget of the Bangsamoro Government, ensure that the five percent (5%) Gender and Development Fund is explicitly included in the General Appropriations Act of the Bangsamoro (GAAB). Scrutinize the utilization of these funds and the usefulness of the projects for which the funds are allocated. Functionally, the Bangsamoro Women Commission is tasked with monitoring these initiatives as part of the Bangsamoro Gender and Development Special Committee, which is a special committee under the Bangsamoro Economic and Development Council (BEDC).

Whenever there are opportunities, promote gender consciousness within the Parliament. The Bangsamoro Electoral Code and the BOL require all political parties to have a women’s agenda. The participation of women in the Parliament is important as women represent half of the population in the Bangsamoro region. If you are a woman MP, know the women’s agenda by heart. Encourage male MPs who are supportive of the women’s agenda to be vocal about their support for women. Each year, there are various activities related to women, such as World Hijab Day (February 1) and International Women’s Day (March 8). Participate or conduct activities in recognition of these important days and other similar activities that promote gender awareness. By doing so, you will highlight the significance of the role of women in nation-building and thus promote the protection of their rights.

**16 Serving the Dual Roles of MP and Member of the Cabinet**

The duality of functions is a special feature of Parliaments all over the world. Some sectors claim that this is the best feature of the parliamentary form of government because the participation of the government in legislative policymaking facilitates the formulation of desired policies and the proper implementation of government programs. Long-winded discussions can be avoided because of the dual exposure of MPs, and at any given time, the urgency of the passage of legislation can be certified to by the Chief Minister.

**16.1 Two-in-One: Multi-tasking as a Facet of Parliamentary Work**

The MPs who serve in dual roles, however, have two (2) separate physical office set-ups, and have two (2) sets of staff, budgets, and work and financial plans. Although they are accountable for the outputs of both offices, they only draw one (1) salary. Multi-tasking is the only recourse. It is thus necessary for an MP to define work plans and tasks and to be on top of fund allocations, disbursements, and of available spendable resources.

For the executive function, the performance of each staff member should be reviewed against individual performance commitments based on the office’s work plan. As mentioned earlier, the work plan should be made clear to every staff member at the beginning of each year. Thus, an annual planning and team building activity is important.

The outputs of legislative staff should also be defined in terms of annual work and financial plans. These include the identified legislative measures, how and when to prepare them, who are the responsible staff, and what resources (consultants, consultations, or studies) are needed to craft these legislative measures.

**16.2 Bridging and Balancing Legislative and Executive Responsibilities**

Wearing two hats is both a big task and an opportunity. You could enhance the appreciation of legislative policies and help translate them into programs and projects and vice versa. Communication is key, and in order to assist in securing buy-ins from both sides, it is imperative that you keep abreast of legislative processing in plenary sessions and committee meetings.

But this is easier said than done. You have to discern how much time you have to allocate for both activities.

Executive functions are quite challenging as they involve implementing various programs and projects in the communities. The structure and mandate of a ministry, office, or agency defines the magnitude of its deliverables. Because plenary sessions are scheduled from Monday to Thursday every third and fourth week of the month, you need to allocate time for executive functions, committee activities, public consultations, and constituency servicing, with all of these requirements in mind.

**16.3 Two-in-One is Manageable; Three or More is No Longer Healthy**

During the incumbency of the first BTA, some of the MPs with Cabinet rank also served as the Chairpersons of their corresponding committees. These MPs have to be credited for their hard work and dedication and for hurdling the difficulties and risks involved in performing multiple jobs. Because of the roles that they play in the peace process architecture, including the Inter-governmental Relations Body (IGRB), their responsibilities expanded and inevitably required more of their time and energies.

These tasks may be humanly impossible to undertake with equal efficiency. An MP may be able to attend effectively to one (1) or two (2) functions, but the inability to satisfactorily undertake other equally important responsibilities may be detrimental to the service. This suggests the need to understand one’s limitations and manage one’s time accordingly.

On the other hand, democratic ideals can be better promoted if a system of checks and balances is observed fastidiously. Allowing other MPs to serve as Ministers or heads of agencies will not only unburden those who have dual functions, it may even increase efficiency and thus be more beneficial to public service.

These same concerns apply to MPs who practice regulated professions (such as lawyers, doctors, teachers, engineers, and the like) who might wish to continue practicing their profession, or even those whose talents, skills, or services are contracted by other entities such as TV personalities or radio announcers.

The practice of profession shall be guided by the phraseology of Sec. 17, Art. VII of the BOL which provides that:

a) The Chief Minister, Deputy Chief Ministers, and members of the Cabinet are prohibited from practicing their profession or engaging in any occupation other than the exercise of their functions as officials of the Bangsamoro Government.

b) Members of the Parliament who are not holding Cabinet positions may practice their professions, engage in any occupation, or teach in schools except during session hours: *Provided*, That members of the Parliament who are also members of the Philippine Bar shall not:

1) Appear as counsel before any court in any civil case wherein the Bangsamoro Government or any office, agency, or instrumentality of the government is the adverse party;
2) Appear as counsel in any criminal case wherein an officer or employee of the National Government or the Bangsamoro Government is accused of an offense committed in relation to the office;
3) Collect any fee for appearance in administrative proceedings involving the Bangsamoro Government; and
4) Use property and personnel of the government except when the member concerned is defending the interest of the government.

c) Doctors of medicine may practice their profession even during official hours of work only on occasions of emergency: *Provided*, That the members concerned do not derive monetary compensation therefrom.

**PART III**
**Oversight**

**17 The Oversight Function**

As discussed earlier, one of the important roles of MPs is the exercise of the oversight function of Parliament. There are various ways that the oversight power of Parliament can be exercised. Among others, this could be through the following: a) reviewing the implementation of the provisions of the BOL; b) reviewing laws passed by the Parliament such as the GAAB; c) scrutinizing budget proposals during budget hearings; d) scrutinizing the absorptive capacity of various agencies; e) submitting questions during the Chief Minister’s hour; f) seeking clarifications from ministers during the Question Hour; g) conducting inquiries in aid of legislation; h) seeking clarifications and explanations from government officers in writing; and i) participating in executive sessions.

**Oversight of the implementation of specific mandates in the BOL.** There are provisions in the BOL and in other laws that stipulate the Parliament’s role in overseeing the implementation of expressed mandates. For example, under the BOL, the Parliament needs to approve the Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP) of the Bangsamoro Government. The BDP, the accompanying Bangsamoro Development Investment Program (BDIP), and the Results Matrix are the essential documents that guide budgeting by the BMOAs. According to the BOL, the Chief Minister shall submit the BDP to the Bangsamoro Parliament for its approval. During the approval process, an MP needs to study and understand at least the development objectives, plans, and programs of the region.

The BDP is the framework that contains the analysis of the planning environment and the strategic development direction of the region. It defines the vision and mission, spatial and sectoral strategies, key programs and projects, and priority measures that need to be legislated.

The programs and projects identified in the BDP are translated into a 6-year investment program that is the BDIP. The performance indicators for the framework and investment component is found in the Results Matrix. Thus, during the deliberations of Parliament on the BDP, it is important to look at these three (3) documents.

**Review of enacted laws.** For example, the extended GAAB of 2022 specifically provides that the Parliament shall review the implementation of funded programs. Thus, the Committee on Finance, Budget and Management may request of the Office of the Chief Minister and concerned BMOAs to report the status of the implementation of their programs and projects.

**Budget hearings.** Budget hearings are especially good entry points for the exercise of Parliament’s oversight power since all ministries and offices are required to present the status of their programs and projects.

**The Chief Minister’s Hour.** According to the Rules, the Chief Minister or a designated member of the Cabinet shall render a report to the Parliament regarding the status and accomplishments of the Bangsamoro Government every first Wednesday of every quarter. Thereafter, the Members of the Parliament may be allowed to ask clarificatory questions on matters covered by the report.

As much as possible, ask questions that will extract valuable information that are important to the Parliament and the public. Engaging the Chief Minister during this time may help shed light on issues or concerns that may be of interest to you and your constituents.

**The Question Hour.** The Question Hour is held every first Wednesday of the month when there is no Chief Minister’s Hour. Members of the Parliament may ask members of the Cabinet questions relative to the policies, programs, projects, and those pertaining to their official functions (Sec. 1, Rule XI, AR No. 268).

Under the Rules, Members must submit in writing the questions that they wish to ask of any member of the Cabinet during the Question Hour. Written questions shall be submitted to the Secretary-General at least three (3) days before the Question Hour. Questions of an urgent nature or those relating to current issues shall be given priority. The written questions shall be read by the Secretary-General in the plenary session upon order of the Speaker.

The Rules also provide that if a verbal answer is desired, the questions shall be answered and disposed during the Question Hour without prejudice to a request by the Minister concerned to ask for more time to prepare an answer. In no case shall the answer be submitted beyond five (5) working days from the date the same was required to be answered (Sec. 2, Rule XI, AR No. 268).

**Committee inquiries and public hearings.** A committee may invite resource persons from the Cabinet to appear during inquiries in aid of legislation. When the inquiry or public hearing involves BMOAs, an MP may request in writing the submission of copies of annual reports and other relevant documents of these offices ahead of the date of the public hearing.

If not complied with, you may inform the committee of the official request sent to the BMOAs. You may opt to repeat the same request during the committee hearing or verbally seek a written explanation from the minister or head of office during the hearing so your request becomes part of the record.

**Inquiry by individual MPs.** Individual MPs may also write the concerned ministries, offices, and agencies on specific concerns. These concerns may be related to the implementation of BMOA programs and projects or their respective program beneficiaries who happen to be your constituents.

**Appearance in executive session.** The appearance of the Member of the Cabinet shall be done in an executive session when the security of the Bangsamoro or the public interest requires or the Chief Minister so states in writing (Sec 3. Rule XI, AR 268).

**17.1 Document Engagements with the Ministries**

If there is a need for BMOAs to submit reports or to respond to clarificatory questions, request for these in writing. Keep a copy of all the letter-requests and responses from these offices. Take note also of occasions when these offices do not respond as these may be put forth during hearings where the relevant parties are in attendance, most especially during budget hearings. Under Republic Act No. 6713, or the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees, “all public officials and employees shall, within fifteen (15) working days from receipt thereof, respond to letters, telegrams or other means of communications sent by the public.”

In the performance of the oversight function, you can be guided by the provisions of Republic Act No. 11032, or the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act of 2018, which provides that all applications or requests submitted shall be acted upon by the assigned officer or employee within the prescribed processing time stated in the Citizen’s Charter, which shall not be longer than three (3) working days in the case of simple transactions and seven (7) working days in the case of complex transactions from the date the request and/or complete application or request was received.

As part of file management, your staff should compile copies of all documents and official papers whether in hard copy or electronic form, including those pertaining to inquiries.

In other Parliaments, the written queries of MPs to ministers are recorded by topic or issue by the Parliament itself. The record also notes if the query has been answered or not. Some will even publish the reply of the minister. This is to show that the Parliament is responsive to the needs of the public. This also provides an indicator of what issues are important to constituents and MPs.

**17.2 Keep Important References Handy**

There are important references that you need to keep on hand to aid you during inquiries or oversight hearings. Among the more basic but important references and files to keep and maintain are the following:

a) The Philippine Constitution;
b) The Bangsamoro Organic Law;
c) The Rules, Procedures, and Practices of the Bangsamoro Parliament;
d) Copies of the laws enacted by the Parliament, particularly the priority Codes;
e) Copies of resolutions adopting the legislative calendar of the Parliament;
f) Copies of the Plenary Journal of Proceedings;
g) Transcript of records of committee meetings (as may be needed);
h) The Rulings of the Chair (Plenary);
i) Directory of stakeholders;
j) Press releases and articles;
k) Media monitoring files;
l) Copies of position papers submitted to the committee and the MP;
m) The Rules of Procedure of the Senate and House of Representatives;
n) The Omnibus Election Code;
o) The Local Government Code;
p) Copies of laws that have amended the Local Government Code;
q) The Revised Penal Code;
r) The Administrative Code of 1987 or Executive Order No. 292;
s) The Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees;
t) Copies of the laws enacted by the Congress of the Philippines such as the National Integrated Protected Area System (NIPAS Act) and the Indigenous Peoples’ Right Act;
u) Presidential Decree No. 1445 or the Government Auditing Code;
v) Memorandum Circular No. 368-91, or the Government Accounting and Auditing Manual;
w) The Annual General Appropriations Act; and
x) Black’s Law Dictionary or any locally-published legal dictionary.

All laws have to be published in the Official Gazette to become effective. The Official Gazette can be accessed online.

**18 The Budget Cycle**

**18.1 What is the General Appropriations Act of the Bangsamoro?**

In the context of our daily lives, budgeting is the limited allocation of money we can use to provide our family’s essential needs including food, accommodation, clothing, utilities and education. In the workplace, the budget is the lifeblood of every organization. Each program, project, and activity requires a budget for its implementation.

Similar principles apply to government. Government budgeting is the critical exercise of allocating revenues and borrowed funds to attain the economic and social development goals of the country. It also entails the management of government expenditures in such a way that will create the most economic impact from the production and delivery of goods and services while supporting a healthy fiscal position (DBM, 2012).

Ensuring that there are enough funds for their operation is an important responsibility of every government agency. In the National Government, the DBM is responsible for the sound and efficient use of government funds and revenues.

It consolidates the budget proposals of agencies and other instrumentalities and submits it to the Cabinet for discussion and the approval of the President before sent to the Congress as part of the President’s budget message and National Expenditure Program. In the BARMM, the Ministry of Finance, and Budget and Management (MFBM) is the office primarily responsible for the preparation of the Bangsamoro Government’s budget. The MFBM shall submit the consolidated proposal to the Chief Minister for discussion by the Cabinet and later on, shall submit the final proposal to the Parliament. In the Parliament, the Committee on Finance, Budget and Management (CFBM) scrutinizes the budget allocation of the various BMOAs, while the Committee on Accounts prepares and finalizes the budget of the Parliament. The proposed budget of the BMOAs and the Parliament must undergo intensive discussions in the CFBM, and the Committee on Accounts, respectively. Once approved in the committee level, the proposed budget is forwarded as a bill to the plenary for deliberation.

Once approved by the Parliament and signed by the Chief Minister, the General Appropriations Act of the Bangsamoro (GAAB) shall be published in the Official Gazette.

The GAAB contains the itemized allocation of the annual budget of the Bangsamoro Government. It contains the following: a) detailed budget appropriation of all BMOAs including that of the Parliament classified into Personnel Services (PS), Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE), and Capital Outlay (CO); b) organizational outcomes (OO) and performance indicators (PI); c) special provisions specific to each BMOA; d) Special Purpose Funds and its special provisions; e) staffing summary of all ministries and offices; and f) the General Provisions of the GAAB.

**18.2 The BARMM Budget Cycle**

Exercising the oversight function requires an understanding of the BARMM’s budget cycle. The budget cycle is composed of four (4) phases:

1. Preparation;
2. Legislation;
3. Execution; and
4. Accountability.

In many ways, this reflects the budget process undertaken at the national level, but with key differences.

**18.2.1 Budget Preparation**

The preparation phase is undertaken by the Executive and it is comprised of the following activities:

**A. Budget call**
The MFBM issues a budget call through a Bangsamoro Budget Memorandum addressed to all heads of BMOAs, the Bangsamoro Parliament, offices of the Bangsamoro Government, and all officers concerned. The Memorandum contains the legal framework that is the basis for budgeting, the determination of budget reform measures, the formulation of the expenditure management framework, the pegging of BMOA budget levels, the list of requirements to be submitted, and the Memorandum Annexes. These Annexes include: a) guidelines on the computation of Tier 1 and Tier 2 levels; b) budget preparation guidelines, forms, and instructions; and c) calendar of activities.

**B. Budget forum**
The MFBM conducts a budget forum to explain the budget guidelines, priorities, timelines, and requirements for the succeeding year’s budget. Several topics are discussed and presented by the MFBM which includes the salient features of the Budget Call to guide the participants in crafting their budget proposals. In the open forum, BMOAs are given the opportunity to clarify some issues and concerns regarding the topics.

The activity is attended by the heads of BMOAs, budget officers, planning officers, accountants, stakeholders’ representatives, and other key officials.

**C. Stakeholder engagement**
The Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority and MFBM engage the members of the Bangsamoro Economic and Development Council and civil society organizations, the BMOAs with their provincial and municipal offices, and other stakeholders. This is to ensure that the needs of the communities or target beneficiaries are incorporated in the proposed budget of the BMOAs.

**D. Submission of budget proposal of each ministry or office**
Ministries, offices, and agencies submit their budget proposals to the MFBM based on the guidelines and using the standard forms provided in the Budget Call Memorandum.

**E. Technical Budget Hearing**
The MFBM conducts technical budget hearings to allow the BMOAs to defend their budget proposals before a panel of budget experts. This oversight panel is expected to give comments and recommendations on the budget proposals of BMOAs.

**F. Review and finalization of the budget proposal**
Based on the comments and recommendations of the oversight panel, the BMOAs revise and refine their budget proposals and submit these to the MFBM. The MFBM, through an Executive Review Board, reviews the revised proposals and recommends further revision to the proposed amounts taking into consideration the utilization of the previous fiscal year’s budget as well as the available fund sources.

**G. Review and finalization of the proposal**
After the review of all budget proposal of BMOAs, the MFBM consolidates the proposals and prepares the BEP.

**H. Presentation of the BEP to the Chief Minister and Cabinet**
After the printing of the BEP, the MFBM officially presents it to the Chief Minister and other members of the Cabinet. The proposed budget will be deliberated upon by the Cabinet. Each member shall be given the opportunity to comment particularly on their corresponding ministry’s or office’s budget. After a certain period and after consideration of the comments and recommendations of the Chief Minister and the Cabinet, the MFBM finalizes the BEP.

**I. The Chief Minister’s budget**
After ensuring that all the necessary revisions in the BEP as agreed during Cabinet meeting are reflected, the Chief Minister’s budget shall be submitted to the Parliament for its consideration.

**18.2.2 Budget legislation process**

The BEP shall undergo the following process:

**A. Submission to Parliament**
The GOTD, through the MFBM shall submit the BEP in bill form to the Parliament, which will then assign a bill number. The bill will be subjected to the legislative process as described earlier. Prior to the deliberation proper, the Chief Minister shall deliver the budget message, and thereafter, the Minister of Finance, together with selected members of the Cabinet, will present the highlights of the BEP.

**B. Deliberation by the Parliament**
The bill will be discussed first by the Committee on Finance, Budget and Management (CFBM). Given the extent of the work needed, the Committee will review the budget through its subcommittees.

The subcommittees are composed of a Chairperson, a Vice-Chairperson, and members. The subcommittees simultaneously conduct hearings on the respective budgets of their assigned BMOAs. After the hearings, the subcommittees, together with the representatives of the ministries, offices, and agencies, will present to the mother committee the respective budget of the BMOAs based on the results of the budget hearings they conducted.

The committee then reviews and scrutinizes the proposal of the subcommittees. In most cases, the Committee supports the recommendations of the subcommittees, but in some cases, it may either recommend the increase or decrease of the budget proposed by the subcommittee.

In the case of the budget of the Parliament, it is the Committee on Accounts which conducts the budget hearings. The offices and services of the Parliament, from the Office of the Speaker to services and divisions of the Parliament, are expected to present and defend their respective budget proposals before the Committee on Accounts. The consolidated budget proposal of all these offices, as approved by the Committee on Accounts, is then presented in an MP's caucus, then submitted to the plenary for consideration and adoption. Thereafter, it shall be incorporated in the proposed GAAB.

Members of the committee shall then approve and sign a committee report on the budget bill. Although committee members are expected to defend the committee report, they have the option not to sign or to sign with reservation as they previously manifested during the committee’s deliberations. An MP who has reservation over the proposed budget may propound the same sentiment during the period of interpellation and debate.

**C. Enactment**
The CFBM shall file a committee report on the bill and the same will be deliberated by the Parliament in plenary session. It will undergo the period of interpellation and debate, and the period of amendments. Upon the termination of the period of amendments, the committee report, as amended, shall be approved. Unless certified as urgent, the bill shall be considered and approved on Second Reading *viva voce* and after three (3) days on Third Reading through nominal voting. The Presiding Officer then declares the votes of the bill. If a majority is in favor of the bill, then the bill passes Third Reading.

**D. Signing and Effectivity of the Act**
After the approval by Parliament, the Speaker and the Chief Minister shall sign the bill.

The GAAB shall take effect after 15 days following its publication in a newspaper of general or regional circulation. It contains the appropriations in terms of specific amounts for PS, MOOE, and CO for various programs, projects, and activities of all BMOAs for a given fiscal year.

**18.2.3 Budget execution**

The Executive takes the forefront during the **execution phase**. This includes the following steps: a) issuance of guidelines on the release of funds; b) budget programming; c) allotment release; d) obligation; e) monthly cash allocation; f) disbursement; and g) submission of accountability reports. The MFBM is primarily responsible for overseeing these processes during the execution phase.

**18.2.4 Budget accountability**

The last phase of the budget cycle is the **accountability phase**. The Parliament oversees budget implementation. This may include a mid-year and year-end performance review conducted by the Parliament through the CFBM.

Other modes of oversight include an audit which may be undertaken internally by the BMOA, and the mandatory post audit observed by the COA.

**18.3 Budget Scrutiny**

Budget scrutiny is important as it will help ensure that government resources are utilized appropriately and effectively. Budget reviews are a form of budget scrutiny. The budget review is done by assessing the achievement of performance targets as well the utilization of the funds authorized under the GAAB.

An MP should look at the performance indicators set for each ministry or office. Performance indicators are usually found in the last part of the budget of each ministry or office in the BEP and GAAB. There is a need to ascertain if the performance indicators used by BMOAs are reflective of their mandate, powers, and functions. Some BMOAs during the transition period tend to change their performance indicators annually, hence the need to scrutinize them.

The constant changing of performance indicators of some BMOAs has resulted in the inaccurate depiction of their actual performance. It has been observed that some of the targets of the BMOAs are either too high or too low.

While the Bangsamoro Government is still in the transition stage, targeting can be improved gradually through in-depth review of the performance indicators and baseline data as well as past performance targets. This is the core of the government’s planning, monitoring, and evaluation functions.

Another area that may be scrutinized is the budget utilization rate (BUR) of the BMOAs, or what is colloquially referred to as the burn rate. To be effective, the CFBM should ascertain the burn rate of the BMOAs every year. For benchmarking purposes, a comparison of the annual burn rate and a comparison of the rate of various BMOAs may be done. Assess whether the performance of a BMOA is high or low. If the performance is high, then commend the BMOA on record. If it is too low, then allow them to explain. If the explanations are acceptable, then recommend measures that will ensure non-repetition of poor performance. Other remedies could be recommended to the appropriate committee. The CFBM may decide to increase or decrease the budget of a particular ministry or office depending on its performance. Depending on the gravity of the deviation from their approved budgets, programs and projects or even their mandate, the Committee may or may not require the ministry or office to explain the circumstances behind the deviations.

The role of the MP in the foregoing scenarios is to help the BMOAs find realistic indicators that are reflective of their functions. Budget scrutiny entails the review of baseline data, the analysis of set targets, and thereafter, the recommendation of appropriate measures to improve a ministry or office’s performance. Budget scrutiny is a technical activity and should not be an avenue for personal attacks towards a head of ministry or office with whom a Member may have differences.

There are basic considerations when preparing for budget deliberations. These include the following:

**Fixing one’s calendar.** In the first four (4) years of the transition period, the CFBM usually held budget hearings from November to December of each year. During this period, the Parliament is usually very busy, making it almost impossible for MPs to attend all budget hearings as scheduled. If you are a member of this committee, it is highly recommended that you prioritize these budget hearings. Ask your staff to help you manage your schedule so you can maximize your time.

Non-committee members may also participate in the deliberation on the proposed budgets of BMOAs both at the subcommittee and mother committee levels.

**Reviewing the BEP prior to hearings.** Before the budget deliberations at the subcommittee, committee, or plenary level, you need to review the submitted BEP. The BEP is usually distributed during the second stage of deliberation.

As mentioned earlier, after the Chief Minister delivers the budget message, the MFBM Minister presents the proposed budget as contained in the filed bill based on BEP. The BEP contains all proposed programs and projects of the BMOAs with corresponding performance indicators, targets, and budget, as well as staff complement. The budget is made up of the Regular Fund, Contingent Fund, Pension and Gratuity Fund, Miscellaneous Personnel Benefit Fund, Local Government Support Fund and Special Development Fund (SDF). The SDF is an annual allocation intended for the rehabilitation and development of conflict-affected areas. It shall be allocated annually for a 10-year period that started in 2020.

Under the General and Special Provisions, it is possible that some amounts are presented in lump sum without any specific details as to its composition. These amounts must be clarified during the deliberations.

**Requiring the submission of documents in advance.** If you are a member of the CFBM, you may require ministries and offices to submit documents prior to the budget hearing. This may include the following signed documents:

i) Annual accomplishment report;
ii) 3-year comparative budget, with physical and financial accomplishments;
iii) 3-year budget utilization rate;
iv) Detailed engineering design and program of works of proposed new buildings;
v) COA Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM); and
vi) Explanation of budget increase/decrease.

**Paying attention to the details.** Pay attention to the utilization of PS, MOOE, and CO allocations. Sometimes, a ministry or office may have a high budget utilization rate for its MOOE funds while its PS and CO utilizations are low. This could indicate that there are delays in the hiring process, and yet the ministry or office was able to utilize program and project funds as well as the budget for the general administrative support services, which utilization is dependent on the hiring of responsible personnel. Review the performance of the programs and projects, and determine if the ministry or office has indeed accomplished its targets.

**Exercising your right to scrutinize the budget.** Sometimes there are issues and concerns that arise during budget hearings. Some MPs may not want to discuss them in a public forum. Assert your right to scrutinize the budget of the BMOAs especially if you sense a possible attempt to railroad the process. If you are given the opportunity to propound questions on the budget under review, then state your reservation and make it part of the proceedings.

**Understanding the Budget**

The Committee on Finance, Budget and Management is one of the most important committees in the Parliament. If you are a Member of this Committee, you have the responsibility of ensuring that appropriations are based on the priority needs of the Bangsamoro. This means that you need to study the budget of all BMOAs.

You must learn the basics of budgeting as discussed earlier. If you have difficulty understanding budget terminologies and figures, you may seek the guidance of the MFBM officials, or at least some experts within and outside the Parliament. Require your staff to review the details of the budget and pinpoint the issues and concerns that are important to your office and constituency.

As a new MP, it is normal that you first observe the actual conduct of a budget hearing, especially at the subcommittee level. But as much as possible, you may attempt to ask question at this level to take advantage of the manageability of small group discussion. In comparison, it will be much more difficult at the committee level as it is a larger group, and in most instances, questions you may come up with might have already been asked by other MPs with prior experience in budgeting.

If your concern is broached earlier by other MPs, you can still manifest a rejoinder or response to their manifestations to strengthen your position on the matter.

Budget hearings involve negotiation between the committee and the requesting BMOA. In most instances, they request additional budget from the subcommittee up to the committee level especially when their proposals were rejected by the MFBM. In the case of a rejection, find out why the MFBM did not consider such proposals. You may ask the representative of the MFBM and the proponent agency, either on record or not, in order to get the rationale of the rejection and the merits of the proposal. From there, you can either support or oppose the proposed additional budget.

In your decision, consider the performance of the BMOAs. If they have not met their targets for the current year, it is likely that such performance will persist in the following year. Thus, it is prudent to support a position that is within the capacity of the BMOAs. Otherwise, the allocated funds—all of which come from taxpayers money—will not serve its purpose.

**19 How to Exact Accountability**

**19.1 What is Accountability?**

Public office is a public trust. This is enshrined in Sec. 1, Art. XI of the 1987 Constitution, and reiterated under Sec. 41, Art. VII of the BOL. These provisions further state that “[p]ublic officers and employees shall at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives. As an MP, you are the *khalifa* (leader or steward) of the people. You have taken not only an oath of office but also an oath of moral governance. People expect that as a public servant, you are able to do your job with utmost dedication, commitment, and integrity. You are accountable for both your actions and inactions.

Every decision counts, as each decision corresponds to resources spent. As an MP, always remember the Parliament’s oversight role over the BMOAs and their utilization of every peso of their budget. This includes your own office’s programs and projects and the use of government funds.

You are also accountable for the position or stand you take on any legislative measure being considered by the Parliament. Whatever is your stand on a controversial issue, at the very least, you need to explain why you took it. For example, during the voting by the Parliament on the Bangsamoro Civil Service Code, an MP registered some reservations on the proposed qualifications of the Division Superintendent because of the existing jurisprudence on the matter.

The MP took full responsibility for making the stand and made it on record. Whether the gesture was appreciated or not, the MP remains fully accountable for it.

Sometimes accountability is demanded as when there is public outrage or pressure over a miscarriage of justice or mishandling of government funds and similar issues expressed through social media and other platforms. In decision-making, especially on the provisions of the law, consider the pulse of the public and the general welfare. For example, several groups pushed for the inclusion of an anti-dynasty provision in the Bangsamoro Electoral Code, reflecting the desire of the common people for equal access and opportunity to hold political power.

When the bill proposing to amend the Code was deliberated upon at the committee and plenary levels, majority of the MPs were in favor of the anti-dynasty provision given the clamor raised during the public consultations held by the Committee on Rules. Among the sentiments raised during the consultations was that politics is dominated by the political elite.

In some instances, there is a tendency to reject other people’s ideas. But as an MP, you must listen, discern, and consider the other side of a decision-point. This is a duty of a people’s representative who operates within the democratic process. Learn to work with this in a healthy way. Transparency starts with you.

**19.2 Discipline and Ethics**

**19.2.1 Ethics**
As a policymaker, one has to stand firm over one’s decisions. Invariably, it is always wise to abide by the principle of ‘honesty is the best policy’, and the current leadership’s policy advocacy of ‘moral governance’. Being an MP, you could be exposed to some lobbyists who wish to trade favors in exchange for your vote or decision. This is not apparent in the Bangsamoro Parliament, nor is it the case. As an MP, you should be careful in dealing with stakeholders, whether internal or external. Be mindful of these possibilities and exercise caution at all times.

**19.2.2 Discipline**
Under the Rules, the Parliament, upon recommendation of the Committee on Ethics and Privileges, may punish its members for any violation of its Rules of Conduct, as well as for disorderly behavior.

The Parliament may censure or reprimand an erring Member with the concurrence of a majority of all its Members. It may suspend an erring Member with the concurrence of two-thirds (2/3) of all its Members: Provided, That a penalty of suspension shall not exceed six (6) months (Sec. 4, Rule XXVIII, AR No. 268).

In special cases, the Parliament may convene its Blue Ribbon Committee which has the power to investigate allegations of malfeasance, misfeasance, and nonfeasance in office involving officers and employees of the Bangsamoro Government, including those in the Parliament.

**19.3 Transparency and Accountability**

Transparency is both a requirement of the law and an integral part of being accountable. It assures that information about policies and laws promulgated by the Parliament are made available to the public. The BOL mandates the Bangsamoro Government to adopt a policy of full disclosure of its budget, finances, bids and public offerings, and to provide protocols to guide local authorities in the implementation of said policy which shall include, among others, the posting of the Summary of Income and Expenditures, and the participation of representatives from civil society in the budget process (Sec. 40, Art. XII, BOL). This should be implemented by every government office.

To promote democratic governance and accountability, the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) posits that transparency in the Parliament includes, among others, the openness on:

1) posting of parliamentary documents such as the plenary’s Order of Business, and each committee’s meeting agenda;
2) publication on the Parliament’s website of the results on the vote on draft legislation and draft legislation itself;
3) providing access to citizens so they can submit comments on the draft legislation;
4) publication of the Parliament’s annual report;
5) publication of the detailed budget of the government;
6) access to the Parliament—such as plenary sessions and committee meetings that are open to the public, and live coverage of the plenary and committee meetings;
7) freedom of information which includes the observance of a law mandating freedom of information and providing for categories of information that are exempted from disclosure; and
8) lobbying, which includes the rules governing the activities of lobbyist in the Parliament, and concomitantly, a register of accredited lobbyists.

Some of these transparency practices are already observed by the Bangsamoro Parliament, but some can still stand improvement.

**19.4 Audit Findings of the COA**

On the other hand, the COA is mandated to ensure accountability for public resources, the promotion of transparency, and to assist in the general improvement of the government’s performance through its auditing function. As an MP, ensure that the BMOAs are observing COA auditing rules and regulations. During budget hearings, BMOAs are asked to submit the COA Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM), a document that contains the COA’s observations in its post-audit of the utilization of funds by BMOAs. These reports are also available in the COA website. Your staff may access, review, and analyze the report. If you wish to be clarified on certain points in the report, you may call the attention of the concerned ministry or office.

**19.5 How MPs Can Promote Accountability**

**A. Call the attention of the Bangsamoro ministry, office, or agency**
You may personally call on a minister or invite the minister for a meeting in your office. Inform the minister or head of an office of your concern or the concerns of your constituencies. Listen and understand the explanation or responses of the minister or head of office. If your concern is not resolved through this conversation, you may file a resolution regarding it.

**B. Bring issues and concerns to the committee**
If a resolution is thus filed, request other MPs to support you. Depending on the magnitude of the problem, you may request the Committee Chairperson to include your resolution in the committee’s meeting agenda. The committee shall then invite the concerned ministry or offices to shed light on the issues and concerns you raised.

If your resolution is placed in the agenda of the committee, prepare your questions for the concerned BMOA. Make sure that their responses, whether written or verbally conveyed, are placed in the record of the committee. Request the committee secretariat to update you on the compliance of the BMOA with your request for the submission of documents.

**C. Partner with CSOs**
Historically, CSOs have played a big role in demanding for transparency and ensuring that grievance mechanisms are in place. They speak on behalf of the people in their respective areas, promote solidarity and participation, and have served as ‘watchdogs’ of government performance which, in a big way, helps in promoting good governance.

As an MP, you should also be transparent with CSOs in terms of your advocacies, policies, and positions on certain issues. Build your understanding of popular sentiment by engaging CSOs through community outreach programs. Partner with them to identify and address legitimate concerns on the ground. Raise their concerns in the proper forum or file a resolution seeking attention to and action on these concerns. You can also conduct public consultations in aid of legislation if you think the issues they raise are valid and represent the clamor of the people.

Inform your constituents and the general public about the processes you are undertaking with CSOs or other partners in order to update them of the developments that impact their lives and communities.

**D. Other options**
Depending on the issue, you also have recourse to the leadership or other appropriate committees such as the Blue Ribbon Committee. You may opt to deliver a privilege speech on the issue, especially if the issue was not acted upon. This may be seen as an offensive act against the specific BMOA, so make sure that you have exhausted all possible means prior to invoking your personal privilege.

**20 The Value of the Record**

In government, everything must be written down. In the vernacular, we call it *resibo* (receipts), which essentially means that you have evidence or proof to present, should a situation warrant it.

**20.1 Official Records Matter**

The records of Parliament include the minutes of the meetings of committees, plenary journals, verbatim transcripts, and video and audio recordings. All these are kept by the committee and plenary secretariats. Later on, these documentation will form part of the archives of the Parliament and made accessible to the public. In the meantime, while the live broadcasting capability of the Parliament is being built, the live video coverage of the plenary sessions can be accessed through the Facebook page of the Bangsamoro Parliament.

Everything you say during the committee meetings and plenary sessions of the Parliament is recorded. As much as possible, state your position in a very clear and concise manner. It is very important that you know how to prevent miscommunication, thus, make sure there is no space for uncertainty in your explanations.

In the future, when there are legal questions or inquiries regarding a particular legislative measure, the record will be referred to. The record, whether these be the minutes of meeting, the journal of the plenary session, or the transcript of proceedings, will confirm your stand and bear you out.

It is therefore necessary to be careful in expressing yourself in parliamentary proceedings. It will also be circumspect for you to read documentation such as the minutes of a meeting and the Journal of the session to ensure that they reflect your manifestations accurately.

It must be reiterated that your office should keep electronic or paper copies of important documents. In record keeping, redundancy of files means security of files. You can officially request the Secretariat for particular records you are interested in and keep your own file of documents or recordings.

**20.2 Put it in “Black and White”**

Write the BMOAs regarding your concerns. This may include a request for justification or explanation for poor project accomplishments, or a request for submission of a report, clarification about a guideline, a request for the status of the implementation of an approved resolution which you have authored, among others.

Compile all files related to your request and inquiries. Document actions and inactions of a BMOA. If these requests are not acted upon, bring the issue to the Committee on Finance, Budget and Management (CFBM). During the budget deliberation, you may make of record all communications that were not acted upon based on the documentations done by your office. The responses of the Minister or head of office could warrant your support or non-support of the approval of their budget proposal.

**20.3 The Opinion of Constituents Matter**

It is very easy to be swayed by media accounts of popular sentiments, but there should be no substitute for directly soliciting your constituents’ view over certain issues. Depending on the extent of your need for verification, a small focus group discussion or a survey can be used to surface public opinion and need. These are the more scientific means of measuring the popularity or the divergence of sentiments, and of harvesting information at the ground level. Most politicians also undertake more informal get-togethers, like the village-based *pulong-pulong*, or a regular meeting with barangay captains. Needless to say, getting the pulse of the people and documenting their comments, fears, perspectives and insights, is a task that your office can undertake to guide you in performing both your legislation and representation roles.

**PART IV**
**Representation**

**21 Community Outreach as Representation**

As an MP, representation is your core function. You represent the Bangsamoro’s interests and are expected to give voice to the needs, fears, and aspirations of your constituency. This is the so-called social compact between an MP and the MP’s constituency. Once elected, your words and actions shall be construed as those of your political party, district, or sector. Moreover, you are expected to devote time to both your constituency and your legislative functions.

Part 1 of this guide gives a bird’s eye view of representation as it relates to the external environment.

**21.1 Being In and For the Communities**

At the community level, people converge at certain places, most notably in public markets, and at events like weddings, and Friday or Sunday congregational prayers. Immerse yourself in the communities by joining local activities, sponsoring townhall meetings or scheduling the more intimate *pulong-pulong*. Extend modest assistance to communities in the form of food or goods, should the situation warrant it.

**21.2 Bridge the Service Gaps in Your Community**

Identify barangay or community-based needs from the *pulong-pulong* and engagements with residents, barangay officials, mayors, civil society organizations, and others.

These engagements could be an opportunity to link the community with service providers and to accurately identify the projects that are most impactful. In other jurisdictions, these activities are called **constituent services**.

In the United States and Australia, a huge part of the work of legislators is to help constituents navigate the federal bureaucracy to obtain assistance or relief. This is very similar to the expectations of BARMM constituents and most Filipinos. As an MP, care must be exerted so that your office’s assistance to constituents are not biased in favor of those whom you presume to be potential supporters. It will be helpful to identify what groups are underserved—these could include out-of-school youth, fisherfolk, people with disabilities, children caught in armed conflict, low-income households, and the unemployed. Factors such as age, sex, income, and disability influence the allocation and prioritization of government resources, and could thus indicate resources that are available to help constituents (such as those itemized in the GAAB and the General Appropriations Act approved by Congress), and conversely, the groups that are underserved. A demographic profile of your district reflecting the distribution of different groups can potentially be the bases for the measures that you author or support in the Parliament.

The kind of constituent services an MP’s office extends may also be influenced by the advocacies of the political party the MP belongs to. Other factors such as the MP’s professional background, affiliation, or expertise, the openness of government leaders to provide assistance, even crises and other fortuitous events influence the nature and kind of services that an MP’s office either solicits or provides.

Constituent services can take a lot of forms. These include writing letters to government offices or personages in behalf of constituents, reaching out by telephone and personally following up on certain requests, informing constituents about important government activities such as vaccination schedules or disaster relief drives, providing or accessing scholarships, supporting youth sports jamborees, representing the families in negotiations for the repatriation of the remains of overseas worker-constituents, and the like.

**21.3 Volunteers are Helpful and Necessary**

Promoting volunteerism can strengthen your constituents’ participation in community servicing. This is consistent with Bangsamoro cultural concepts and Islamic practices such as *sadaqqah* (charity), and you can use existing social networks to promote citizen involvement in community affairs. As encouraged in the *Surah Al-Mā’idah: 2* of the Qur’an, Muslims are enjoined to “[h]elp one another in righteousness and piety.”

Involving the community in spreading goodwill ultimately facilitates consolidation and fosters political stability. As much as possible, encourage volunteerism within your district and involve women’s groups, business federations, the local chapter of civic organizations, and the youth, among others. Organize small groups of volunteers at the grassroots level to help in community-related activities. Partner with legitimate peoples’ organizations if appropriate. Be clear on the objectives of organizing, and assign a focal person from your office to this initiative.

**22 Participating in Public Hearings and Consultations**

*Shura* (consultation) is necessary and is embedded in the rules of the Bangsamoro Parliament. In fact, no bill can be passed into law without going through public consultations.

As an MP, it is important that the people feel your presence on the ground during public gatherings. Whether or not the consultations you conduct are of an official nature, getting the sense of the public on important issues, especially that of your constituents, is a crucial aspect of your work as a legislator.

You will realize many things when you personally engage with the community. In community consultations, you can immediately evaluate circumstances on the ground, get the popular sentiment, and gauge whether a particular stance will receive broader acceptance. This kind of knowledge is greatly superior to information given by your staff, your supporters, or merely reading the minutes of meeting. In the absence of polling, this becomes a way of directly measuring public sentiment particularly for sensitive topics that people may not readily share with others.

Participation in public hearings and consultations gives MPs an opportunity to engage with stakeholders. Prior and after the activity proper, talk to as many people as you can. If the situation warrants, be part of the discussion. This will allow the people to know you and your position on the subject being discussed. Be clear and concise in your statements. Take note of the important positions of the stakeholders as this may help you in the improvement of the bill being subjected to public consultation, including language and framing.

The organizer of a public consultation, townhall meeting, or assembly chooses the participants and the venue of the activity, among other logistical considerations. While there are target participants for each public consultation, as the organizer of the activity, you and your staff must analyze the situation on the ground.

This is especially critical for consultations involving multiple local politicians who differ in perspectives, alignments, and affiliations. Even the invitation matters: who do you invite, who do you not invite? What names and titles do you use to address certain people? Consider the implication of each word and inflection in the invitation and other documents emanating from your office.

In choosing the venue of the activity, select neutral ground as much as practicable. If you are not from the area where the venue is located, you should be mindful of political dynamics. Situations on the ground are oftentimes complicated. The Secretariat or staff must also pick the right venue to ensure physical security.

Because of the complexity of circumstances, it would be advantageous to work with partners such as CSOs, the academe, and other reliable institutions on the ground. But be fair and careful. Choose a CSO with a good track record and a reputation for supporting diversity and consensus.

When asked to speak during public meetings, speak in the language or dialect that your constituents are comfortable with. Representatives of the people are oftentimes regarded as their hope.

As much as possible, inspire your constituents, give them hope that better days would come, but make sure that your message is clearly communicated. Manage expectations. Don’t promise what you can’t deliver. Do not argue. Listening will give you time to study the dynamics during the consultation, absorb and analyze conflicting positions, and allow you to take notes that you can review later on.

Document these public consultations through an audio or video recording. This record can help you analyze the perspectives of various entities and triangulate issues and positions taken in the series of consultations you conduct. You will be surprised at the analytic value of these recordings and how they can help affect a particular plan or course of action you are considering.

**23 The Privilege Speech as a Call to Action**

When the situation calls for it, stand on behalf of your constituents and the general public. Be a strong voice and take the role of a champion. Deliver a speech on a specific topic based on their sentiments. There is a broad range of issues and concerns from the ground that need to be elevated to the Parliament. Some of these are popular and commonly-held in many areas, but others could be peculiar to your constituency.

When a fellow MP seeks a clarification on certain points about your speech, do not feel offended. It is an opportunity to expound your message and how it will redound to the common good.

**23.1 Timing is Important**

Request the Floor Leader to include your privilege speech in the calendar but make sure that it is scheduled when the topic is not related to any legislative measure being deliberated upon on the Floor. Avoid days when there are more than five (5) MPs scheduled to deliver their privilege speeches, as the interest of spectators and viewers wane fast. When caught in this situation, consider rescheduling the delivery of your privilege speech so you can maximize the opportunity to reach as many people as you can.

**23.2 Disseminate Information About Your Speech**

Disseminate information about your privilege speech using various media platforms. Engage media regarding this matter, if necessary.

**PART V**
**Other Unwritten Rules**

**24 The Necessity for Completed Staff Work**

Being prepared for foreseeable scenarios will always be better than scrambling to adapt to a situation. This is practical even from a political point of view, considering that every positive engagement can translate to additional support and potential votes.

What is “completed staff work”? Completed staff work, or CSW, is a process undertaken by staff members who are responsible for submitting written or verbal recommendations to a superior (in this case, the MP). It is a comprehensive and systematic process of analyzing a problem, recommending solutions, and presenting it to the staff member’s principal. It ensures that the principal does not need to do anything further than reviewing the submitted document and indicating approval or disapproval (DAB, 2023). It is an essential management principle in ensuring that all recommendations that reach the level of the superior are already vetted.

Completed staff work means that your staff undertook extensive research, data gathering, evaluation, and scenario building. This means that once you receive a report, nothing else needs to be added. Preparation always matters. For MPs, all your activities related to your major functions of legislation, oversight, and representation, must be supported by CSW.

**Require CSW to Avoid a Comedy of Errors**
Imagine a scenario where you, as an MP, are asked to attend an activity in a known university. You were invited as a guest because you are one of the sponsors of the activity. You expect that you have your own reserved seat because you are a sponsor, and that your staff went ahead of you to help co-organize the activity on behalf of the office.

You assume that your staff had already arranged the logistics for you. But when you arrive at the venue, you are told to wait. You are new to the place, and you are not that familiar about the people at the event. Thus, you try to patiently observe what is happening. From where you stand, you see your staff and organizing personnel talking hurriedly in a corner, clearly trying to fix an avoidable issue.

After a relatively long wait, they find a seat for you at the edge of the presidential table. While waiting for the start of the program, the emcee acknowledges the participants by calling their names and offices individually. You inevitably expect yours to be mentioned next. But after every other guest is acknowledged, the main host does not mention your name or office.

Being seated at the edge of the presidential table, and not being recognized by the main host, may indicate that there was no CSW. Remember that this is not about you as a person, but about the office and the institution that you represent.

A matrix that contains the checklist of tasks to undertake (prior, during, and after each activity), could be prepared by the staff as reference for the MP in every activity. Has your staff coordinated with the organizers of the event to get basic information about the activity? Have they, in turn, relayed basic information to the organizers? Have you identified any resource requirements—for example, do you need to prepare a speech, or bring a token of appreciation for your hosts? Who are the other invited guests? Is attendance in this event an appropriate use of your time, or are you better off sending a staff member to represent you?

**When Staff Work is Inadequate**
Imagine a scenario where a bill is being deliberated by a committee. Despite its categorization as a priority bill, you find that almost 40%-50% of the text has already been revised by the committee. One could think that the bill has not undergone thorough research, careful study and analysis, or consensus building. This may invite various opinions, criticisms, and the like.

It is perfectly acceptable for a bill to undergo certain amendments, but a complete overhaul may indicate that staff work was inadequate. CSW will ensure that a bill can stand scrutiny.

**25 Protocol, Social Graces, and Etiquette**

**25.1 Protocol and Protocolar Guidelines in Official Activities**

Protocol is the accepted or established system of rules, procedures, or behavior to be followed by a group, organization, or individual in specific situations. Tracing its origins to the Middle French “protocolle,” the word also refers to the set forms of etiquette to be observed by heads of state, as well as the responsible government department overseeing the enforcement of such rules. This speaks of expectations usually attached to positions of rank. As such, protocols are set for myriad activities, from formal State ceremonies and events to more informal social gatherings. While MPs are generally expected to maintain orderliness in official activities, it is good to understand why there are rules governing the way MPs comport themselves, whether in their official or unofficial capacities.

Many protocols are established by law such as Republic Act No. 8491, or the Flag and Heraldic Code of the Philippines, which requires that reverence and respect be always accorded to the Philippine flag, the national anthem, and other national symbols that embody the country’s ideals and traditions and express the principles of sovereignty and national solidarity. Other protocols are established through administrative fiat such as Memorandum Order No. 14, s. 1998 which authorized the assignment of low-numbered protocolar plates to motor vehicles used by government officials of the Republic of the Philippines.

The United Nations itself has established its Manual of Protocol which consists of guidelines gathered from practical experiences and common sense successfully applied over the years. Each Permanent Mission and Observers Office has a copy of the Manual which also contains important information on administrative and diplomatic procedures to facilitate the activities of the diplomatic community stationed at the UN Headquarters.

For instance, in the matter of official visits of a Head of State, Crown Prince and Princess, or a Vice President, it is expected that the concerned Permanent Representative informs the UN Chief of Protocol at the earliest possible date of the intended date of visit. The Manual also prescribes that “*when a Head of State visits the UN Secretary-General, the Chief of Protocol will greet the Head of State as he/she alights from his/her vehicle and will escort the Head of State to the Office of the Secretary-General. At the end of the meeting, the Secretary-General will bid farewell to the Head of State or Government. The Chief of Protocol will escort the Head of State or Government to the General Assembly of the designated area*”. For Sessions of the General Assembly, the Manual prescribes specific arrangements. We quote certain paragraphs of the protocol:

> “...the delegation of a Member State shall consist of not more than five representatives and five alternate representatives and as many advisers, technical advisers and experts as may be required by the delegation. If the chairperson of a delegation is either the Head of State or Government, Vice-President or Minister for Foreign Affairs, he/she is considered as the chairperson of the delegation while present in New York (head of delegation ex officio) and, as such, is not counted as one of the five representatives. The heads of delegation ex officio are always listed before the remaining members of the delegation. With the exception of the Heads of State or Government, Vice-Presidents or Ministers for Foreign Affairs, all other heads of delegation will be counted as one of the five representatives.
> 
> The list of delegates provided by each Permanent Mission should reflect the exact names of the delegates, their diplomatic ranks (ambassador, counsellor, etc.), functional titles, and representational capacities (representative, alternate representative, special adviser, or expert).
> 
> During the general debate, seats will be reserved in the VIP area of the General Assembly Hall for the spouses of the Heads of State or Government, Vice-Presidents, Crown Princes or Princesses participating in the general debate, provided that the Chief of Protocol is notified in advance of their attendance at the Session.
> 
> In addition, depending on availability, a limited number of seats will be reserved for the guests of delegations in VIP Section A (up to 15 seats) and on the 4th floor balcony of the General Assembly Hall. The seats in VIP Section A will only be allocated for the duration of the address of the head of delegation at the plenary meeting.”

There are rules on etiquette that have also become part of official protocol during State ceremonies. For instance, in a receiving line intended for visiting officials and diplomatic personages, it is observed that the visiting dignitary or official extends their hand or greeting first before the receiving official takes it in a short, firm handshake. The House of Representatives and the Senate pass their respective resolutions designating certain members to comprise the delegation to officially welcome the President to the House of Representatives for the Constitutionally-mandated report on the State of the Nation. Before the President is received by the Delegation, the Armed Forces of the Philippines Honor Guard, together with the Armed Forces Chief of Staff and the respective Sergeant-at-Arms of the House and the Senate, accord military arrival honors to the President and escorts them to the Rear Entrance of the House of Representatives.

These are behaviors that are considered correct, polite, and respectable, particularly in such settings. When calling on the President, Vice-President, Senate President, Speaker of the House, and the Members of the Cabinet, Members of the Bangsamoro Parliament are expected to follow procedures that are observed by these offices, and to maintain official decorum at all times. During courtesy calls or for official ceremonies, it is not advised for spouses to be brought along unless it is expressly allowed by these offices on certain occasions.

Members of Parliament and in particular, the Philippine House of Representatives and Senate, officially authorize the attendance of their members in international parliamentary conferences and international bodies like the International Labor Organization, and the Speaker and Senate President both communicate this authorization to the Department of Foreign Affairs. This authorization establishes the credentials of the Philippine delegation as participants of the conference. In practice, official representatives and delegates to these conferences may be accompanied by a Delegation Secretary or by Advisers. The official authorization contains the names of these persons, and in present day practice, they may be allowed into the conference venue to assist the official delegation.

**During courtesy calls or for official ceremonies, it is not advised for spouses to be brought along unless it is expressly allowed by these offices on certain occasions.**

**It is always prudent to ask for information on protocols observed in official activities, conferences, and calls.**

**25.2 Social Graces and Etiquette**

The guidelines or rules governing official behavior are set to avoid embarrassment and misappreciation of acts or intent, and to accord respect to the status of personages and official relationships among institutions. These observances are reflected in what is called “official decorum.” Hence, formal attire is prescribed for certain occasions like the Joint Session of Congress for the State of the Nation Address of the President, and the practice of standing when the President enters and leaves the Plenary Hall is always observed.

Decorum also extends to table manners observed during State banquets and receptions. Typically, it is considered rude to belch or burp during formal banquets. It is also a breach of protocol to attend formal banquets without being officially invited. So is being late to an official ceremony or activity.

An MP or their office must also respond to formal invitations to inform on whether or not the MP is attending the event. This is necessary so that Protocol Officers can finalize seating, banquet, and reception arrangements. We often skip this courtesy, a fault which could unwittingly bring about the perception that the invitee does not have regard for the person, office, or organization that sent the invitation, or for the importance of the occasion. In the context of the United States, protocol only allows certain reasons for rejecting the President’s invitation to a State dinner: death in the family, serious illness, “unavoidable” absence far away from the District of Columbia (where the seat of government is, including the White House where State banquets are held), or a family wedding.

Thus, it is always prudent to ask for information on protocols observed in official activities, conferences, and calls. This may be available with the Parliament’s Protocol and Decorum Division. It is necessary for an MP to coordinate with this division and to be briefed accordingly about an official activity, event, or ceremony.

For international conferences that have bearing on the Parliament and the laws of the land, it is important to know the agenda of the conference and to gather as much information about the items to be discussed. Participating in small and plenary meetings do require familiarization with conference protocol such as when to speak, length of time for each manifestation, order of the delivery of remarks or manifestations, and the like. It is considered appropriate preparation to be apprised of the political issues involved in any item in the agenda to avoid making awkward or unpleasant remarks.

Remember, behavioral guidelines are observed for specific official events and ceremonies. One’s position or rank does not allow for liberties to be taken especially during official activities. You and your colleagues represent the Parliament as an institution and the Filipino people, as a whole.

**Addressing colleagues.** The words “peers” and “colleagues” are frequently used to refer to fellow MPs. Following protocol and the usual decorum, MPs are supposed to accord their fellow MPs the highest esteem and respect. In official deliberations in Parliament, it is typical to address colleagues as “Your Honor” or “the gentleman or lady from the province of Maguindanao del Norte,” for example, or to mention the district your colleague represents.

In committee settings, an MP who wishes to make a remark, convey a position or opposition, or to seek clarification from the author of a measure, should seek the permission of the Presiding Officer who is usually the Chairperson, a Vice-Chairperson, or a Member of the Committee who is designated by the Chairperson to preside over the meeting. Likewise, during Plenary sessions, an MP has to seek the permission of the Speaker in order to interpellate the sponsor of a committee report, or another MP in connection with a privilege speech.

No matter how opposed one is to the measure being discussed or a manifestation made on the Floor, an MP should avoid speech that can cause embarrassment to another, abusive or insulting words, or those that can rouse anger or resentment. This observance does not only mean to preserve the reputation of a colleague, but to maintain amity and order within the Parliament. Disruptive speech or remarks not only disparages one’s colleagues but erodes public respect for the institution.

When addressing each other informally, MPs usually use their colleagues’ nicknames. Filipinos often use informal salutations as a sign of conviviality.

However, in addressing colleagues in writing or in formal communication, it is typical and acceptable in the Philippines to use the MP’s professional title, such as Dr., Atty., Engr., Mr., Mrs., and Ms. followed by the MP’s surname. For example, your salutation can be “Dear Engr. Adil-Ampatuan.” The simplest salutation is “Dear Sir,” or “Dear Madam.” While this may be seen as overly hierarchical by non-Filipinos, it is taken locally as a sign of respect.

**Respecting your colleague’s “first dibs” on a brilliant idea.** It sometimes cannot be helped that MPs file similar proposals; indeed, one does not have the monopoly over a good idea. However, if a colleague has filed a measure, it would be wrong to copy and file the exact measure. Similarly, if it comes to your knowledge that an MP means to file a certain measure over an important subject matter, do not try to beat that colleague by hastily filing a measure using the same idea just so that you are recorded as the first author. It would be best to instead ask your colleague’s permission to be placed as a co-author of the measure. Affording them this simple courtesy can only strengthen your working relationship and even allow you to propose amendments and improvements to the measure.

**No matter how opposed one is to the measure being discussed or a manifestation made on the Floor, an MP should avoid speech that can cause embarrassment to another, abusive or insulting words, or those that can rouse anger or resentment.**

**Discard biases or perceptions about other cultures and learn about them with an open mind.**

**Cultural and social sensitivity.** Cultural sensitivity is defined as being aware that cultural differences and similarities between people exist without assigning them value—positive or negative, better or worse, right or wrong. Being culturally sensitive promotes inclusivity and harnesses the power that diversity infuses into the MP’s role of representation. For example, the Philippine House of Representatives ensures that food prepared and served during banquet reservations comply with Muslim cultural norms. This can be taken one step further by ensuring that food is halal, as well as providing options for other people with similar cultural or health considerations, including those following strict vegetarian and non-allergenic diets. In BARMM, another common practice is the conduct of a tri-peoples’ prayer during official events in order to ensure that the majority of religious orders and denominations—namely Muslim, Christian, and non-Moro IPs—are represented.

It is beneficial to consciously develop one’s sensitivity to cultural differences. This can be done by being aware of certain holidays and events celebrated by other groups or by attending festivals and activities to get to know people and their unique backgrounds, and to know the cause or reason for the celebration of festivity. Discard biases or perceptions about other cultures and learn about them with an open mind. Read books, browse the internet, and ask your colleagues about interesting facets of their history and culture. Immersing one’s self in other cultures and learning about the historical importance placed by them in certain practices promotes empathy, fosters unity, and deepens the bonds of friendship and goodwill.

**Spaces for Sensitive and Confidential Matters**
Oftentimes, MPs need to talk among themselves on sensitive topics such as budget matters, high-interest legislation, or issues surrounding their work environments. Moreover, there are occasions where MPs may need to talk with national officials or international partners, formally or informally. In these situations, they should have enough privacy to openly exchange ideas without any staff or relatives listening to the conversations. These situations require staff and other hangers-on to avoid intruding into these private conversations and huddles, or to join MPs in the main table, even if they are close relatives of the MPs.

Usually, these conversations may feel simple and light at first, but will always lead back to sensitive issues and concerns. That is why, as much as possible, the support staff should avoid joining when MPs are informally grouped. The support staff may also find separate space to talk with their peers to make their time productive.

The same protocol should be followed when MPs meet with national officials or international partners unless the meeting specifically allows support staff. Ensuring the privacy of spaces and securing seating arrangements conducive to easy and unhampered exchanges should be part of staff work.

**26 Training and Further Education**

The opportunity to enhance your knowledge while working in Parliament should not be wasted. This may be obtained through training programs. Aim to participate in many training programs and earn additional academic degrees if you can, preferably from reputable universities.

**26.1 Learning is a Continuing Process**

Undergoing training and further education is ideal and necessary for an MP. Strive to continually develop your potential by exploring avenues for education. As an MP, you should always be sharpening your skills, honing your abilities, and keeping yourself up with current trends in order to perform your duties properly and to be responsive to public needs and expectations.

As a legislator, learning from the experiences of others and their success stories might help your growth as a professional, and translate to better work performance and outputs. MPs should therefore exert every effort to participate in local and international training opportunities to learn more and consequently contribute more meaningfully in the Parliament.

If time warrants, MPs may get further formal education. This will also help in building networks and alliances. There are available online courses and weekend courses which would allow you to earn degrees or certificates.

**26.2 Build Your Own Mental Model**

You should also be able to build your own mental model and framework, both technically and ethically, to guide you constantly. This is useful when you are crafting laws because a guiding framework will help you maintain consistency in your decision-making on issues. A mental model is the specific thought process you use to examine a problem or to make sense of a construct. There are many types of known mental models, and each one takes a unique view of a concept in order to reduce its complexity. In short, it is the mind’s way of making sense of something. For example, rationalizing a legislative measure by asking some basic questions (see anecdote) is an example of a mental model.

**If time warrants, MPs may get further formal education. This will also help in building networks and alliances. There are available online courses and weekend courses which would allow you to earn degrees or certificates.**

Just manage your time and resources once you opt to pursue further studies. There are also many executive courses or post-graduate degree programs that an MP can attend. These can expand your network and expose you to other professionals, government and private sector executives, and even public influencers from whom you can learn.

**Rationalize the Legislative Measure by Asking the Basics**
As an MP, do not just agree with what has been put on the table, and do not settle for “cut-and-paste” provisions. For example, in the deliberation of bills on the creation of an office, you can ask the following basic questions:

1. Who will benefit from the bill? Who will manage the office to be created?
2. What are the problems that this office is supposed to respond to? What are the requirements in the creation of this office?
3. When will the physical office be constructed and when will it become operational?
4. Where will this office be established? Where was the proposal patterned after?
5. Was there a study conducted, the results of which supports the creation of the office?
6. How much will the creation of the office cost the Bangsamoro Government? How shall its operation be sustained?

Additional questions, such as “what does a functional office look like,” and “what are the potential challenges that this office would face once established” are also helpful in strengthening your mental model. If your questions are not answered well, you will now be able to recommend improvements to the bill. You may also decide not to support the bill altogether.

**27 Communications and Public Relations**

Communications and public relations are among the most powerful tools that MPs have at their disposal. Ensuring that your constituents have access to information about what the Parliament is doing on their behalf contributes significantly to stability and to institutional longevity. In today’s constantly evolving communications landscape, MPs must adapt to new technology to maximize reach and influence. Public relations goals are maximized by technology, and one’s public image may be further enhanced by an active social media presence.

**27.1 Create and Organize a Communications Team**

Consider forming a communications team to prepare and execute your communications strategy. Recruit professionals who have writing skills, or public relations experience, or social media communications aptitude. Promote your agenda and advocacies, but be mindful of negative propaganda and fake news, and respond quickly to them. Use both the traditional mediums of communications and the new technologies available. Allot resources for your public relations activities. You may also utilize the Parliament’s communications team for your requirements. This office usually features MPs in articles, publications, and broadcast programs once or twice a month. Provide the BTA’s Communications Office with appropriate information on your bill or resolution so they can properly post it on time, or plug it in their radio program when your measure is placed in the Order of Business.

**27.2 Develop a Communications Plan**

Work with your communications team to formulate a simple communications plan. Identify your target audience, from the regional level all the way to your local constituency, and identify your appropriate medium of communication.

The contents of your communication messages may start with your defined legislative agenda, then may gradually expand to include information on the legislative measures you have introduced or are planning to file. Your communications plan can also include updates on the Parliament, and on what are being discussed every session or every committee meeting. You can also share updates on activities you have attended. You may even voice your opinion on certain issues of national importance especially when they affect your constituents' wellbeing. It is imperative that this information is shared with your constituency in a clear and timely fashion.

Timing matters in sharing information and in communicating. Find that “best time.” In times of crisis, an MP must communicate warnings, appeals for sobriety, or requests for assistance or relief, clearly and with immediacy. The timing and tone of messages also depend on your objective. Invariably, messaging would adjust to whether you are 1) trying to raise awareness; 2) trying to change attitudes, or 3) trying to motivate people to act.

**In times of crisis, an MP must communicate warnings, appeals for sobriety, or requests for assistance or relief, clearly and with immediacy.**

**27.3 Communication Strategies**

There are various types of communication strategies. The choice of strategy will depend on your objective and audience. Strategies include social media posts, photo essays, infographics and posters, website promotion, newsletters, press releases, blog posts, briefings or press conferences, e-blast messages, and so on. Your communications team can use a combination of these strategies to maximize exposure and reach.

Press interviews are also as powerful as delivering privilege speeches. These will allow you as an author to expound on the aims of the measure and will help you reach segments of the public that do not or cannot access the proceedings of Parliament.

**27.4 New Communication Platforms**

In the past, people were likely to be avid newspaper readers, or were glued to television and the radio for news and information. Nowadays, people tend to rely on social media platforms for their information needs. There are many platforms that allow you to engage with your constituencies and the rest of the world more directly and efficiently.

The presence of these platforms is both an opportunity and a problem. Social media platforms present a huge opportunity and advantage in terms of reach and cost savings. However, they can also be a source of negative messages and can be manipulated by determined groups that hold contrary views to yours. Thus, your team should manage these communication tools well. Be an instrument of positive social media utilization and support efforts to address the growing problem of disinformation and online negativity and propaganda.

**When You are Not Visible, You are Not Counted**
When an important piece of legislation is adopted or approved by the Parliament, be among the first to announce it, talk about it, or comment on it publicly. This is one of those instances when your communications team should work fast, otherwise, other persons or sectors who are as interested on this piece of legislation will take the spotlight and you would lose a good opportunity to communicate your position or be credited for good work.

**28 Security, Mental Health, and Self-Care**

**28.1 Ensure Your Safety**

As an MP, whether you are an experienced politician or not, you must take extra care of your health and well-being. The nature of the job and the environment you work in is stressful. Politics tend to sow cynicism and engender ill motives. Such an environment can sadly promote hostility even when you least expect it. Keep in mind that the person beside you may one day suddenly decide to go against you, or act for their own interests at the expense of your own.

Additionally, your safety should also be given the utmost priority. Ensure that the people that surround you are trustworthy. Your security matters significantly more during outdoor activities. As much as possible, it is best to hire professional security personnel for your own overall safety and protection.

**28.2 Keep an Open Mind**

You are now a public figure, whether you like it or not. This opens you up to public scrutiny and criticism especially when you take on a stand about a current social issue. Emotions have no place in politics. When dealing with criticisms, maintain your composure and keep an open mind. Master mental toughness while being gracious in handling other peoples’ views.

**28.3 Practice Healthy Living**

Good health will allow you to function well, think better, and relate more effectively. Maintaining good health is a great challenge nowadays because of factors such as lifestyle choices, habits, and the environment. You must watch and monitor your diet, especially so that you attend many activities where food is served. As much as possible, submit yourself to an annual executive check-up. See a doctor if needed. More importantly, regularly engage in a form of physical exercise that will help you maintain cardio-vascular health and mobility.

The Bangsamoro Parliament has a Medical and Health Division. It is good to schedule a visit with the division for basic checkups.

Furthermore, devote time to the family. Your busy schedule can sometimes hamper you from spending quality time with loved ones who are always a source of strength and inspiration.

**28.4 Be Mindful of Your Mental Health**

Mental health is important in all workplaces, without exception. Because of their strategic role in nation-building and in the maintenance of an effective and functioning democracy, those who hold government positions including MPs need to be mindful of their mental health. Working in high-stress environments such as the Parliament can lead to exhaustion, sadness, or even depression. Strive to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Reach out to friends and family, and nurture a solid support system. Try to develop a hobby that will ease your tension, restore balance, and allow for reflection and contemplation.

Being aware of the psychological impacts of one’s work and social environment is beneficial not only to the MP, but also to their families, colleagues, and staff.

**Being aware of the psychological impacts of one’s work and social environment is beneficial not only to the MP, but also to their families, colleagues, and staff.**

Early on, the new MP must recognize that the job shall be highly stressful throughout the term of office. It entails representation of constituents, attending numerous meetings and investigations, managing staff and one’s office, attending party caucuses and events, being available to the media, advocating for specific issues, and conducting electoral campaigns. For instance, the debilitating effects of the earthquake, typhoon, or armed conflict event, have as much impact on MPs as on their constituents. MPs are expected to voice out their views, concerns, and to protest on behalf of their constituencies. This inherent role is part and parcel of politics, but unlike ordinary citizens, elected representatives are challenged to live up to constituents’ expectations, while delivering on their mandates despite limitations of law, time, and resources.

Other stressors such as ongoing investigations, a death in the family, political dynamics among colleagues, or negative press, can affect the mental stability, efficiency, and effectiveness of an MP. Despite these stresses, the MP is expected to remain cool, calm, and unfazed.

When those holding critical positions in an organization, and in this case, the Parliament, are not mindful of their psychological state or condition, any negative effects on the quality of decision-making may have far-reaching socio-economic and political consequences on the nation. Ashley Weinberg, in her article entitled “The Health of Politicians”, points out some case studies of leaders which show links between these leaders’ well-being and their decision-making.

She mentioned US President John F. Kennedy’s treatment for Addison’s disease and his subsequent decision to invade Cuba, and former United Kingdom (UK) Prime Minister Anthony Eden’s biliary tract operations and post-operative disability and the subsequent Suez Crisis. These illustrate how stressful the job of politicians is, how important it is to be constantly aware of one’s mental health, and to strengthen one’s ability to cope with undue stress.

Depression can remain undiagnosed to one who is less than proactive about mental health. Weinberg also cited surveys of first-term UK Members of Parliament who showed increases in symptoms of psychological strain (such as rising anxiety, lowered self-esteem, and difficulties in decision-making). While this may be expected as a natural consequence of job adjustment, the physical symptoms of strain such as difficulty in sleeping, overeating, and unexplained pains, can remain elevated. Weinberg cites the positive example set by Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik who openly acknowledged that he was diagnosed with depression and stepped down from office. Norwegians found this honesty a compelling reason to re-elect him to office.

It will be beneficial to MPs, their families and constituents to seek the appropriate professional psychological processing and therapy when they experience the symptoms of stress such as anxiety, difficulty in sleeping, and other physical symptoms. It cannot be overemphasized that first-termers, especially those without any legislative experience, should undergo knowledge-transfer activities such as seminars, familiarization tours, and coaching/mentoring sessions to lessen anxiety and feelings of inadequacy. MPs approaching the end of their terms may also want to consider actively managing their mental health and well-being as part of the change management process.

**Emotions have no place in politics. When dealing with criticisms, maintain your composure and keep an open mind. Master mental toughness while being gracious in handling other peoples’ views.**

**28.5 Prayer Helps**

Do not belittle or forget the value of prayer. Trust the Almighty in everything that you do. Cleanse your soul, offer your intentions, and pray for protection and guidance all the time.

**PART VI**
**Wrapping Up and Moving Forward**

**29 Wrapping Up**

Be prepared emotionally and psychologically for the end of your term. As much as possible, learn to let go peacefully and with much gratitude. All good things must come to an end, as they say. A grateful heart will not only enable a smooth transition from the life of an MP to another chapter of your life, it will also help open your mind and spirit to other possibilities.

**29.1 Do an Inventory**

All properties, equipment, office space, and even official government data registered under your office, your name, or that of your staff, must be inventoried at least three (3) months prior to the end of term. This will allow clear documentation and facilitate the smooth turnover of these properties to new incoming MPs.

**29.2 Turn over Government Properties**

All those in the inventory must be turned over to the Secretary-General, or to designated officials immediately after the organization of the new Parliament. There are government procedures for this and forms to fill out, so make sure that everything is accounted for. A smooth turnover of properties will ensure a speedy processing of accountability clearances, salaries, and terminal benefits, if any.

**29.3 Clear All Pending Financial Transactions**

It is a must to liquidate all cash advances and to settle payables, both of which must be done not later than a month after June 30 following a Parliamentary election. Otherwise, the MP shall not be cleared of accountabilities and issued a clearance.

**29.4 Respond to Audit Observation Memoranda, if There Are Any**

Any Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM) findings and recommendations of the Commission on Audit must be answered prior to the issuance of a clearance to an MP. If there are disallowances, they must be settled immediately.

**29.5 Secure a Work Clearance**

An MP and staff should obtain clearances from the Office of the Speaker. A clearance will not be issued if there are administrative and financial obligations that have not been settled. Failure to do so may affect your future job opportunities and could earn you a negative image.

**29.6 Ensure Legal Cover**

All important positions taken during the discussions of controversial provisions of proposed measures documented by the Secretariat, especially in the budget and the priority Codes, form part of substantive proof that could provide legal cover to an MP in case of future legal issues or litigation. It is best to secure a copy of audio recordings and other important files such as committee and plenary proceedings, or documentation of public consultations and hearings. For MPs holding executive positions, this will include contracts and agreements undertaken by your ministry, office, or agency.

**29.7 Review and Reflect**

Reflect on the journey of the last three (3) years. How have your professional and personal plans progressed? Do you think you have achieved your goals and objectives as an individual, as a professional, and as a public servant? Assess and look back on what went well and what could have been done differently.

Finally, thank the Almighty for the opportunity to have served the Bangsamoro people.

**Government Property is Not Personal Property**

When it is time to leave office, all those in the office inventory of equipment, furniture, and fixtures must be accounted for and returned to the AGSD of the Parliament. These include desktops, laptops, printers, LCD projectors, tables, chairs, filing cabinets, photocopiers, cameras, whiteboards, television sets, among others, that have been placed in your name and which bear government property stickers.

The failure to return these properties is contrary to law. It will also be detrimental to the service and the new incoming MPs who may not be able to immediately organize and begin their work due to the lack of equipment. You should remind your staff to be careful in handling office equipment and facilities so that they remain serviceable once passed on to other officials and staff. Government procurement, particularly for capital equipment and furniture, takes time, and there is no guarantee that these items can be easily replaced.

Following basic rules and regulations should be considered an observance of moral governance. This is part of what you swore to when you took your oath of office.

**The Post-MP Journey**

Dear MP,

There is a time to say goodbye. In fact, it is always good to begin with the end in mind. As they say, every beginning has its end.

Develop a plan to achieve your goals for the post-MP life. It might be the right time to prepare for the next election, or to leave public service altogether and finally enjoy other things or aspects in your life. You may want to initiate the establishment of a group composed of former MPs who may wish to mentor new MPs. Join a legislators’ organization, if you wish, or start one, or simply wait for guidance or inspiration on the next step to take.

You may also want to throw a traditional thanksgiving “*kanduli*” for all your friends, supporters, and allies. Thank all of them for their unwavering support from the campaign period to the end of your term or service as an MP. Whether you seek re-election or not, thank everyone for the opportunity to be of service to the people through their support. Moreover, if you intend not to pursue re-election, explain to your staff the reasons behind this choice, and encourage them to find alternative employment. There is life outside Parliament, and there are still greener pastures to pursue.

May you continue to have better days and even more successful undertakings. And may the Almighty Creator bless you and the Bangsamoro with peace and prosperity!

Your partners in the service,

**Acknowledgment**

Writing this guide was both challenging and fulfilling. It stemmed from a genuine desire to share bits of information that would greatly help those who have not been exposed to the rules and traditions of parliamentary work and legislation. We had gained experience in both and wanted to impart knowledge that should be useful to those who either want to work in the legislature, or study it for some other important objective or goal.

This book would not be possible without the friends and colleagues who contributed their time and effort to put it together.

Ms. Maria Carmen “Ica” Fernandez helped us begin assembling these stories. While chatting with her over dinner in February 2023, a stray cat began scratching at MP Adil-Ampatuan’s leg, and meowed loudly when the conversation came to the topic of completed staff work for MPs. Perhaps, we thought, the cat was trying to convey a message.

This humorous thought led to the idea of coming up with a little handbook or guide. Despite her extremely busy schedule, Ica helped grow this germ of an idea into a viable undertaking that is based on our experiences and insights into the processes of legislative policymaking.

We also acknowledge the inputs of expert peer reviewers, Deputy Speaker MP Atty. Laisa M. Alamia, Floor Leader MP Atty. Sha Elijah B. Dumama-Alba, Minister MP Atty. Ubaida C. Pacasem, MP Atty. Rasol Y. Mitmug, Jr., and Maria Victoria “Mags” Maglana who helped us tighten the content of this guide. Their own experiences indeed helped make our narratives richer and insightful.

We acknowledge with deep gratitude the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) led by Speaker Atty. Ali Pangalian Balindong and the leadership of the Bangsamoro Government led by Chief Minister Ahod Balawag Ebrahim for inspiring and leading the Members of the Bangsamoro Parliament in its transition journey.

We would also like to extend our sincere appreciation and thanks to the national government leaders who supported the Bangsamoro peace process throughout the decades. Particularly, we acknowledge President Rodrigo R. Duterte and President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr., who appointed the members of the first and second BTAs, respectively, through the facilitation of the Office of the Presidential Adviser on Peace, Reconciliation and Unity (OPAPRU) led by Sec. Carlito S. Galvez, Jr.

Most of all, we bow our heads in gratitude and thanksgiving to the Almighty for His guidance and provision, and for bringing us together in this humble contribution to the success of the Bangsamoro.

*Shukran ya Allah,*
*Alhamdullilah!*

Both chambers observe a voluntary political party quota. Currently, there is no electoral quota for the youth.

For appropriation bills, a message to the House from the Governor-General recommending the purpose of the appropriation in accordance with Section 56 of the Australian Constitution must be announced before the bill is introduced. A further message must be received before any amendment can be moved which would increase or extend the objects and purposes or alter the destination of a recommended appropriation. This requirement, in effect, prevents private members from moving such amendments. However, a private member may move to reduce the amount of a proposed expenditure or may move to omit items.

The House of Representatives has a specialized unit that is tasked to study and analyze the budget; it has 29 full-time positions.

The Australian Constitution states that the Senate may not amend proposed laws appropriating revenue or money for the ordinary annual services of the government. The Senate may not amend any proposed law to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. The Senate may, at any stage, return to the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend, requesting, by message, the omission or amendment of any item or provisions therein.

A “point of order” is a motion that seeks to call the attention of the Speaker or Presiding Officer whenever a Member believes that proper decorum of debate is not being followed or that there is non-observance of procedure. An MP can rise anytime to ask to be recognized on a 'point of order'.

**9. Can an MP change political party affiliation during their term of office?**
Under Art. IV, Sec. 4(b) of the Bangsamoro Electoral Code, the changing of political party affiliation during the party representative’s term of office shall *ipso facto* forfeit the seat in the Parliament. 

The electoral party representative who changes political party affiliation within six (6) months before an election shall not be eligible for nomination as party representative under the new party or organization.

**10. Can the Rules of the Senate and House of Representative apply to the proceedings of the Bangsamoro Parliament?**
Yes, Sec. 1, Rule XXXII of the Parliament states that if there is no provision in the Rules that is applicable to a specific case or proceedings in the Parliament, the procedures of the Senate of the Republic of the Philippines, the House of Representatives of the Philippines, and the generally-accepted principles on parliamentary procedures shall apply suppletorily. 

In such cases, the Parliament shall recognize the principle of *stare decisis*, or the commitment to stand by earlier decisions.

**11. Can the committees convene meetings after adjournment of the sessions, sine die?**
Yes. Under Sec. 1, Rule XIII of the Parliament, the meetings, hearings, and consultations of the committees and subcommittees are held on the mornings of a regular session of the Parliament, on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday in the Executive Lounge of the Parliament building, without prejudice to holding it, whenever necessary, on days and in venues outside of those herein mentioned. Only the Committee on Rules and such committees and subcommittees to which it has granted permission may meet and/or conduct hearings or consultations while the Parliament is in plenary session, has adjourned, or is in recess.

During the incumbency of the second BTA, the Parliament, by an approved motion, allowed the committees to conduct meetings even during the Parliament’s mandatory break.

**12. Can a committee member who has signed a committee report still ask questions during the committee's final deliberation?**

Yes. Under Sec. 13, Rule XIX, during the final voting stage, Members of the Parliament may make a verbal statement on the final vote lasting not more than five (5) minutes, or submit a short written statement which shall be included in the minutes of plenary proceedings. 

As a rule, the Speaker shall give Members leave to make a statement before the vote is taken.

**17. Is there a time limit set for a Member to speak during a debate on the Floor?**
Yes. Sec. 6, Rule XIX provides that a Member shall not be allowed to speak for more than one (1) hour in debate on any question. 

However, the sponsor of any measure may consume as much time as may be deemed necessary to express the contents and purposes of the bill.

**18. What is meant by the term turno en contra?**
In its literal sense, the term means “turn to speak against.” In the legislative process, legislators rarely take the Floor to render a speech against a measure that is being considered in plenary session. 

Most legislators partake of the privilege given to interview sponsors and authors of measures on the provisions of a measure during the period of interpellation and debate. But there have been occasions when a legislator stood up to ask for the leave of the chamber to “speak against” a bill. Usually, the *turno en contra* period is availed of during deliberations on the budget. In the Congress, Senator Tito Sotto stood on the Floor to speak against the Reproductive Health bill and referred to the speech as his *turno en contra*.

**19. What are unexplained absences and how many of these can result in the imposition of sanctions?**
In a sense, unexplained absences mean absences from committee meetings and plenary sessions for which no explanation is given. In most assemblies and parliaments, certain situations justify absences, and these include sickness, missions on parliamentary, government or party business, attendance in meetings of international assemblies, attendance in committee meetings outside the Parliament, cases of *force majeure*, “authorized” absences, cases where the Member is “unavoidably detained,” excuses that are considered “satisfactory,” transport problems, and the like.

In the Rules of the House of Representatives, “a Member of a Committee who incurs three (3) consecutive unexplained absences within a regular session shall forfeit membership in that Committee” (Rule IX, Sec. 36, Rules of the House of Representatives, 19th Congress).

**20. In the Philippine Congress, what is the role of a witness’ counsel or lawyer during an inquiry in aid of legislation?**
The role of counsel or lawyer of a witness is limited to giving advice of the latter’s legal rights throughout the inquiry or investigation. The statements and answers to questions shall be given personally by the witness.

**About the Authors**

**Engr. Baintan Adil-Ampatuan, MNSA** has been a legislator for more than five (5) years and a development planner for more than two (2) decades. MP Ampatuan stands as one of the 80 presidential appointees of the second Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) Parliament, from February 2019 to date. As a Member of Parliament, she is one of the vice-chairpersons of the Committee on Finance, Budget and Management and a member of eight (8) committees of the Parliament, specifically, the Committees on 1) Rules; 2) Ways and Means; 3) Agriculture; 4) Public Works; 5) Education; 6) Health; 7) Women, Youth, Children, and Other Vulnerable Sectors; and 8) Labor and Employment. As of May 2024, she principally authored 47 bills and 115 proposed resolutions. Of the 115 filed resolutions, 34 have been adopted by the Parliament. Additionally, she is one of the co-chairpersons of the Joint Task Forces on Camps Transformation (JTFCT), on the side of the Government (GPH). The JTFCT is one of the peace mechanisms under the Socio-economic Cluster of the Inter-Cabinet Cluster Mechanism on Normalization (ICCMN).

She earned her degree in Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering (BSCE) from the Notre Dame University in 1991. She became a licensed Civil Engineer right after obtaining her undergraduate degree in 1991. She also obtained her Master in Professional Studies – Development Management, major in Public Affairs Management in 1994. In 2021, she finished her Senior Executive Master in National Security Administration (SE-MNSA) from the National Defense College of the Philippines (NDCP), where she received meritorious awards. As a result of graduating with SE-MNSA, she also became a commissioned reserve officer of the Philippine Army, with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. She has an in-depth understanding of autonomous government bureaucracy, having risen from the ranks, starting as a Development Management Officer and later becoming the Executive Director of the former Regional Planning and Development Office-Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (RPDO-ARMM). She has accumulated robust experience in planning, investment programming, budgeting, project implementation, alongside monitoring and the evaluation of policies, programs, and projects. She left a significant footprint in the ARMM by leading the creation and development of various regional plans and notably, the ARMM Transition Report. She was also an awardee of the Civil Service Commission-ARMM 2014 Regional Outstanding Lady Executive (ROLE). She has also undergone several trainings locally and abroad, ranging from leadership programs in the United States of America (USA) and Japan, to exchange and learning visits to South Korea, Sri Lanka, Kingdom of Bhutan, Timor-Leste, Scotland, Canada (Toronto, Kitchener, and Ottawa), Europe (The Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium), Spain, and International Training Program 3 (ITP3) on Disaster Risk Reduction and Management in Stockholm, Sweden.

**Violeta T. Veloso** served as Executive Director of the Committee Affairs Bureau of the House of Representatives for more than 20 years. She started her career in the House in 1987 as Committee Secretary of the Committee on Transportation and Communications. Her years in the service gave her the opportunity to study the workings of other legislatures, and to familiarize herself with the nuances of policymaking and politics. She worked towards professionalizing committee services, conceptualized and implemented training programs, standardized performance indicators of staff, and honing officer and staff capacities in agenda-setting to assist incoming Congresses in determining their legislative priorities. During her service in the House of Representatives, she edited the publications containing the recommendations of the Secretariat for legislation in the 14th Congress up to the 19th Congress. She was part of the Secretariat Task Force of the House and the Senate that assisted the leadership in the crafting of the final version of the bill that was enacted as the Bangsamoro Organic Law and views her contribution in this guide as a continuation of the advocacy of promoting peace and the democratic process by capacitating legislative workers and first-time Bangsamoro legislators in the area of legislation and representation.
