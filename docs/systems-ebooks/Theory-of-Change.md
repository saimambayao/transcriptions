**CONCEPTS AND DEFINITION**

**1 INTRODUCTION**

**1.1 HIVOS AND THEORY OF CHANGE**
Hivos aims for structural, systemic change that enables all citizens – both women and men – to participate actively and equally in the decision-making processes that determine their lives, their society and their future. Consequently, Hivos staff and partner organisations engage in complex social processes.
Change emerges as a result of the simultaneous push and pull of multiple political, cultural and social forces involving many individuals and entities. Social change processes are complex and characterised by non-linear feedback loops: our own actions interact with those of others and a myriad of influencing factors. This triggers reactions that cannot be foreseen and makes outcomes of change interventions unpredictable.
Given these uncertainties, how can we plan strategically and sensibly? How can social change initiatives move forward in emerging change processes in a flexible way, while remaining focused on the goal?
In this context of complexity, Hivos values working with theory of change (ToC) as an appropriate approach to guide its strategic thinking and action, as well as its collaborative action with others. The use of a ToC approach fosters critical questioning of all aspects of change interventions and supports adaptive planning and management in response to diverse and quickly changing contexts. It contributes to the quality and transparency of strategic thinking, and therefore to personal, organisational and social learning. Use of a ToC approach should make Hivos more effective in achieving its goals, and enable it to understand better why and under which conditions specific strategies might work for specific groups in society.

**1.2 ORIGIN OF THE GUIDELINES**
This guide has evolved from experimentation with and learning about theory of change thinking and its use in practice, which started in 2007. The approach presented here has been developed over time in a series of workshops with Hivos staff, partner organisations and consultants in all regions where Hivos is active. These guidelines have benefited greatly from the feedback of participants.
In 2010, Hivos established a Theory of Change Learning Group, to consolidate learning from practice. The ToC Learning Group members varied over the years, but key participants have been the authors of this guide: Marjan van Es, Irene Guijt and Isabel Vogel, with Iñigo Retolaza Eguren and staff of the Centre for Development Innovation (CDI) of Wageningen University and Research Centre.

***

Important milestones in the learning process were the publication of the guide ‘Theory of Change - A thinking and action approach to navigate in the complexity of social change processes’, written by Iñigo Retolaza Eguren (2011), and the launch of Hivos Theory of Change Resource Portal (2012). This portal is now hosted by CDI: www.theoryofchange.nl.

**1.3 USE OF THE GUIDELINES**
This guide aims to support Hivos staff in applying a ToC approach as intended and set out in Hivos’ policy brief: ‘Hivos and Theory of Change’.
A theory of change approach can be used for different purposes, by different users, and at different moments in the cycle of developing, monitoring, reviewing or evaluating a programme or strategy. Table 1 gives an overview of the relevance of the chapters for different uses and user groups.
**Part A** introduces theory of change and Hivos’ perspective on ToC thinking: what it is, what you should know before you start, and key features of ToC thinking that you need to understand in order to be able to use the approach effectively and reap the benefits of the process. ‘Theory of Change’ as a term is used by an increasing number of organisations and demanded by donors, but is not always understood in the same way. Hivos has developed its own understanding of the process and what good quality ToC work is all about. All users who are not fully acquainted with a ToC approach and/or are new to Hivos will benefit from reading this part.
**Part B** is a stepwise approach to guide you through the process of developing a ToC for different purposes. Here you will find also information on how to use specific tools recommended for each step. This is the most practical part of the document.
Part B also includes ideas for a ToC Quality Audit that can be used to check whether all the necessary components are elaborated with sufficient quality. Such an audit is useful in two situations. First, for staff responsible for assessing proposals, either from partner organisations to Hivos, or from Hivos to other donors. It can also be used as an extra check at the end of a ToC design process by the team involved in the process. Second, for those involved in the review of the ToC of an ongoing intervention.
**Part C** contains references to tools suggested in Part B, as well as resources and sites where you can find more information about ToC use. This material will enable you to dive deeper in specific aspects of ToC, find appropriate tools for your purpose as well as updates and experiences of how others use ToC.
This guide does not elaborate on how to facilitate the process of developing a ToC. You will find some (links to) resources related to facilitation in section 8.3.

**LANGUAGE USED**
A brief word about the language in the guide is needed for clarity.
When the authors provide information or an explanation, they address the user(s) of the guidelines, primarily Hivos staff, with ‘you’. The stepwise approach is structured around a number of questions the users are encouraged to ask themselves. Therefore, the authors chose to use ‘we’ in the questions, with ‘we’ being Hivos staff and partners or allies who should ask and answer these questions before moving on.
The authors make a distinction between ‘stakeholders’ and ‘actors’. A stakeholder is a person or entity that has a concern in the initiative or the change process and an interest in its success, and could win or lose. The term ‘actor’ is used for a person or entity that has an influence in the envisaged change process, but may be indifferent to its success, or even ignorant of the change initiative or process.
Hivos uses the term ‘project’ for an initiative with a clearly defined objective, project plan, duration and resources. A ‘programme’ is larger in scope and scale, may comprise several projects and has a longer time perspective.

**2 THEORY OF CHANGE**

**2.1 WHAT ARE THEORIES OF CHANGE?**
‘Theories’ of change are the ideas and beliefs people have – consciously or not – about why and how the world and people change. How people perceive and understand change and the world around them is infused by their underlying beliefs about life, human nature and society. They are deep drivers of people’s behaviour and of the choices they make.
These beliefs are formed by different aspects of people’s lives:
• class, gender, religion, the history of their family, the values they have been brought up with;
• history, culture and context of where they live;
• personal life experiences and their different identities in different settings;
• formal education and – where relevant – their knowledge of academic social theories.
People’s position in society and their personal beliefs and values shape their mental models and inform their own ‘theories of change’. For actors involved in social change work, these mental models influence the role they see for themselves (and their group or organisation) and the strategies they choose.

**BOX 1: HIVOS’ DEFINITION OF THEORIES OF CHANGE**
Theories of change are the ideas and hypotheses (‘theories’) people and organisations have about how change happens. These theories can be conscious or unconscious and are based on personal beliefs, assumptions and a necessarily limited, personal perception of reality.

**WHAT IS A TOC APPROACH?**
Theory of change as an approach is a guiding framework for all stages of thinking, action and sense-making when we intervene intentionally in social change processes.
For Hivos, theory of change is a process-oriented approach to analysing the complex systems in which we and our partners and allies work, and for planning actions we think will influence parts of the system in a positive way. The process helps us navigate in unpredictable and complex processes and to track changes in the system to which our interventions may have contributed.

***

**BOX 2: DEFINITIONS OF THEORY OF CHANGE THAT ARE IN LINE WITH HIVOS’ VIEW**
• Theory of change is an ongoing process of reflection to explore change and how it happens - and what that means for the part we play in a particular context, sector and/or group of people. (Cathy James, Comic Relief Theory of Change Review, 2011)
• Every programme is packed with beliefs, assumptions and hypotheses about how change happens – about the way humans work, or organisations, or political systems, or ecosystems. Theory of change is about articulating these many underlying assumptions about how change will happen in a programme. (Patricia Rogers, in ‘Review of the use of ‘Theory of Change’ in international development’, Isabel Vogel, 2012)

Hivos distinguishes between ToC as a way of thinking (overall approach), a process (doing a ToC analysis/enquiry) and a product (the result of a ToC process).
• ToC is a thinking and action approach to navigate the complexity of social change. It is a way of looking at the world that calls on and fosters people’s capacities for critical questioning, not taking things for granted, dealing with uncertainties, and acknowledging the inevitability of diverse perspectives.
• ToC is a process. If used well, a ToC enquiry is an ongoing process of analysis and reflection. It is not a one-off exercise in the design phase of a programme, but rather involves an ongoing action-learning cycle.
• A ToC is also a product because a ToC enquiry results in specific outcomes – in a narrative and/or visual form – that represent the theory of change of an organisation, a team, or a project or programme. It is a ‘living’ product because it will change over time. A ToC is a temporary snapshot, a reflection of the thinking at a specific moment, which will not and does not need to be complete. As a product, a theory of change offers a framework for sense-making that needs to be used, revisited and adapted as the project or programme moves on, other actors come in, changes in the context occur and learning takes place.

**DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TOC AND LOGFRAME**
The Logframe (short for Logical Framework Approach) is a management instrument widely used in the development sector for planning, monitoring and evaluation. The terminology used in Logframe and ToC approaches is similar but there are important distinctions. How do ToC and the Logframe relate - and differ?
As explained above, ToC starts from the premise that social change processes are complex and unpredictable, that different perspectives exist on what needs to change and why, and that a full analysis of the context of a change intervention and of the assumptions underlying its design are crucial to enhance its chance of success.

***

Logframe is driven largely by its form – a matrix structure. This matrix encourages linear thinking about change. Language used and associated with the Logframe, such as ‘planning’ and ‘delivering’ results, suggests project implementers are in control of the situation and can predict or promise what will happen over time. The three result levels of the Logframe leave no room for intermediate steps. This pushes the users to make wide conceptual leaps and does not encourage them to question the feasibility and plausibility of the envisaged change process. There is limited attention for assumptions underlying the strategic thinking and assumed causal relations between result levels.
Despite these differences, the approaches can be used together. Many donors ask for proposals that contain Logframes for planning, monitoring and evaluation. When a team conducts a full ToC analysis in the design phase, it will have all the information needed to develop a Logframe that is as realistic as possible.
However, this guide encourages taking monitoring and evaluation further than just monitoring in order to meet the information needs of the Logframe-based proposal. It will benefit the programme or project immensely if the team uses the full ToC as the basis for tracking and learning about the change processes as they unfold, and for strategic reflection. Doing so will also provide the information and arguments to explain necessary adaptations to the donor.

**BOX 3: DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE TERM ‘THEORY OF CHANGE’**
**Perspective 1:**
ToC is seen and used as an improved logic model to better predict, plan and deliver results. Some critics call this understanding of ToC ‘Logframe on steroids’.
**Perspective 2:**
ToC is seen and used as a critical, multi-stakeholder exploration of intentions, interests, power and gender relations, in order to contribute to social justice, equality, sustainable development. The key question is ‘What change, for whom, why – and who says so?’
**Hivos supports the second perspective on ToC:**
• ToC is not about ‘predicting change’. ToC is our own narrative of change, a hypothetical projection of the future. It is full of assumptions and based on values, political choices, and on what we know at this moment. It does not predict that the change process will evolve in that way, nor can it promise to deliver intended outcomes.
• ToC is an approach that enables individuals and organisations involved in change processes to:
- better understand the system they are part of without oversimplifying it, in order to support change in a strategic and responsive way;
- to learn from how the process evolves in reality, so that strategies can be reviewed and adjusted along the way.

**TABLE 2: COMPARING AND CONTRASTING THEORY OF CHANGE AND LOGFRAME**

| THEORY OF CHANGE | LOGFRAME |
| :--- | :--- |
| Critical thinking, room for complexity and deep questioning | Linear representation of change, simplifies reality |
| Explanatory: A ToC articulates and explains the what, how, and why of the intended change process, and the contribution of the initiative | Descriptive: A Logframe states only what is thought will happen / ‘will’ be achieved |
| Pathways of Change, ‘unlimited’ and parallel result chains or webs, feedback mechanisms | Three result levels (output, outcome, impact) |
| Ample attention for the plausibility of assumed causal relations | Suggests causal relations between results levels without analysing and explaining these |
| Articulates assumptions underlying the strategic thinking of the design of a policy, programme or project | Focuses on assumptions about external conditions |

**2.2 WHY A THEORY OF CHANGE APPROACH?**
A theory of change approach entails that people and organisations involved in intentional change processes explore and make explicit their theories of change and the assumptions underlying their thinking. This exploration includes clarifying how they see cause-effect relations between their actions and the intended changes.
Why is this important? In a multi-stakeholder setting, the people involved may well have different views on what the desired change is, why it is desired and how it could and should happen. If these different views are not shared, misunderstandings can arise and stakeholders may start off on the wrong foot when working together. A joint ToC exploration can help to understand what drives each stakeholder and how they understand the situation. It helps identify common ground for action, as well as opportunities and obstacles. It lays the basis for collaboration with clear definition of roles and responsibilities as well as for joint monitoring, evaluation and learning processes.
In an organisation or team, exploring existing theories of change will contribute to a more shared understanding of organisational purpose, core values and strategic choices. This, in turn, lays the foundation for more consistent programme implementation. In most organisations, a difference can be observed between the theory of change as reflected in formal policy documents and the practice on the ground. Mapping out the theory of change and underlying assumptions can help to make these differences explicit, to stimulate

***

discussions about why they exist and to align formal policy and actual practice. A ToC analysis can also help to narrow the gap between the often ambitious change goals of an organisation and its actual potential, as it leads to more realistic objectives and more appropriate strategies.
Consequently, an effective ToC process always involves a dialogue about existing understandings of how change can happen. As this will challenge everyone involved to take a broader perspective, a ToC process can be confrontational for individuals and organisations. It may uncover structural inconsistencies or contradictions between ‘the walk and the talk’; for example, in the way power is exercised in an organisation or paternalistic behaviour towards marginalised groups.

**2.3 CORE COMPONENTS OF A TOC PROCESS AND PRODUCT**
There are multiple ways to develop theories of change, depending on purpose, stakeholders involved, specific preferences or needs, capacities and available time. The field-testing of ToC processes with Hivos staff and partners (see 1.2) have resulted in seven core components and key questions to be addressed in a full ToC process and product. This guide offers a stepwise approach to develop these components of a ToC process, as explained in Chapter 5.
1. What is the desired change, why and for whom?
2. Analysis of the system and the current situation:
• context analysis: social, political, economic, ecological and other dimensions
• stakeholder and actor analysis
• power and gender dynamics, drivers of change, opportunities for change
3. Mapping pathways of change:
• Who and what needs to change in order to realise the longer-term desired change?
• How do we think the change process might evolve from where we are now?
4. The assumptions underlying our theory of change:
• What do we assume about the needs, interests and behaviour of stakeholders and other key actors?
• What do we assume about cause-effect relations in the logic of the change pathways?
5. Strategic options:
• What is the best way for the organisation or project to contribute, what should its role be? (position, capacity, added value)
• What do others do? Is there a need and opportunities for multi-actor collaboration?
6. Strategic planning for the project period (theory of action)
7. Monitoring, evaluation and learning framework and process:
• How to document the change process?
• What to monitor and how?
• Learning agenda
• When and how to revisit the ToC and reflect on what works?

***

**2.4 THEORIES OF CHANGE AT DIFFERENT LEVELS**
Theory of change is used for thinking about change at different levels, ranging from world views to project level theories of change.
The broadest level at which the term is used refers to what some call ‘worldview’ theories of change. People have ideas about how social change happens, assuming, for example, that positive change happens through democratisation processes and political contestation; through economic growth; through building organisations, strengthening civil society and citizen agency; or through individual awareness and empowerment. These theories and beliefs are political in nature and grounded in personal histories and socio-cultural factors. But they are also based on and influenced by social and political theories and research.
In developing theories of change in a professional setting, such as in Hivos, three other levels of ToC thinking can be distinguished. Figure 1 illustrates how these different levels relate to each other.
The organisational level refers to Hivos’ overarching theories of change. A general policy or longer-term strategic plan should contain a ToC that answers questions such as: What analysis do we, as an organisation, make of what needs to change in the world and why? How do we think social transformation happens and how do we see our role in it? Why do we choose to work on specific themes and why do we make certain strategic choices? Which values, analyses and key assumptions are underlying our thinking?
**NB** The analyses and theories of individual staff members will clearly not always coincide fully with the formal organisational view. Revisiting organisational policies and strategies based on new insights and questioning by staff members and other stakeholders will ensure a dynamic policy process, renewal and innovation. In order to maintain shared ownership and consistency in implementation, these review processes must be organised in ways that enable all staff members to contribute meaningfully to the process.
A policy domain or thematic level seeks to define a ToC for a specific theme or area of Hivos work, for example for Sexual & Reproductive Health & Rights, or Renewable Energy. A ToC for a policy domain builds on the vision, values and overall strategic choices of the organisational ToC. This level looks at questions such as ‘Why is this theme or policy area critical – and what kinds of people should benefit? What do we consider to be the main drivers and obstacles of change? What are the strategies we consider most effective for making progress on these themes and why, and what is Hivos’ role in these strategies? A policy domain or thematic ToC can be specified further for a regional or country context.
A programme or project level ToC is largely derived from the ToC of the related (thematic) policy domain, but is made context-specific. For example, a ToC of a Biogas programme in Indonesia, or a project advocating LGBTI rights in Kenya. It zooms in on specific objectives

***

and strategies for a defined period of time. It is based on the outcomes of a sound analysis of the current context, actors, opportunities, as well as the objectives and priorities of Hivos or a back donor. To make a distinction with the other levels of ToC mentioned above, Hivos prefers to call a ToC at this level a Theory of Action. But most actors in Hivos’ field of work use the term ToC at project or programme level too.

**THEORIES OF CHANGE @ DIFFERENT LEVELS**
(Summarized from Figure 1)
**WORLDVIEW:** Personal beliefs and understanding of how change happens, and why. Social and political theories and development perspective that inform our thinking.
**ORGANISATIONAL TOC:** Vision, mission, organisational values, strategic preferences, and role of the organisation in - and its contribution to - social change.
**TOC FOR A SPECIFIC POLICY DOMAIN OR THEME:** How an organisation or team expects change to evolve in a specific (sub)system, sector or thematic area, why, and its own role and contribution.
**PROJECT OR PROGRAMME THEORY OF ACTION:** The analysis and intervention logic of a project/programme to achieve a specific change objective in a specific context, incl. its assumed contribution to longer term social change. Relates to thematic or organisational ToC.

**2.5 USING TOC THINKING FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES**
ToC thinking and the stepwise approach offered in this guide can be used for different purposes and at all stages of a project, programme or initiative. A ToC process is most effective when tailored to suit your purpose, so agreeing about the purpose prior to starting is critical. The purpose also influences who needs to be involved in the process. You will see that Step 1 in Chapter 5 starts with clarifying the purpose. The most common purposes of ToC thinking are described below.

**PROGRAMME OR PROJECT DESIGN**
A ToC process for programme or project design takes place as part of the preparation or inception phase. It entails a broad analysis of the system that needs transformation, identifying and involving key actors, initial programme design and strategic choices, and identifying critical assumptions. It forms the basis for adaptive management and monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) during implementation. The ToC products are used for internal and external communication about the initiative.

**REVIEW AND/OR QUALITY AUDIT OF AN EXISTING INITIATIVE**
A ToC process for the review or quality audit of an existing programme or project aims to improve its quality, to revisit and sharpen strategies, to clarify underlying assumptions and to adjust strategies and operational aspects to changed realities. The outcomes of the review may be used to adapt plans and implementation, to improve the MEL process or framework,

***

and to support communication about the programme and its results. A review can also be undertaken to prepare for a new phase of an initiative.

**STRATEGIC LEARNING DESIGN AND KNOWLEDGE GENERATION**
A ToC process is an effective way to identify knowledge gaps, and learning or research questions. It helps create a structure to build an evidence base about what works or not, for who and why, and under which conditions. In particular, the assumptions identified in all steps of the process offer entry points for questioning, documenting and monitoring of what we think will happen and what happens in reality. The ToC analysis also helps to identify who should participate in the learning process.

**EVALUATION**
A programme or project ToC provides a good basis for a mid-term review or an ex-post evaluation, as it makes explicit what the initiative aimed to achieve, why and how it was supposed to work, and key assumptions made. The evaluation will seek to substantiate the validity of the ToC, offering important information and insights for a possible next phase design or for learning with similar initiatives. The findings contribute to the body of knowledge on the topic of intervention, for example, the role of women in conflict resolution. Evaluation findings based on a clear ToC provide a sound basis for accountability to funding agencies, either by evidencing the initiative’s contribution to the overall goal or offering in-depth and relevant lessons learned.
If an initial ToC has not been developed for the initiative, then the evaluation can start with reconstructing its implicit ToC. This offers a good base for the evaluation and will support an improved and shared understanding of the initiative by the team and other stakeholders. This in itself often leads to improvement of implementation and/or a next phase.

**MULTI-ACTOR COLLABORATION AND COLLECTIVE IMPACT MONITORING**
For a multi-actor initiative, jointly undertaking a ToC process is critical in order to come to shared understanding, decision-making and ownership of the initiative design and operations. An important product of such a ToC is a collective MEL process and framework for impact monitoring, a condition for joint learning and demonstrating success. In practice, aligning the systems and MEL practices of the different partners in the project for collective impact monitoring often proves challenging. The ToC process can help to define clear and agreed roles and responsibilities of each actor involved.

**SCALING UP AND SCALING OUT**
A ToC process can help Hivos or its partners to analyse the suitability and feasibility of replicating or scaling up and/or out an initiative in a different context. The results will provide insights into the need to adapt the ToC, why and in what way, and will identify assumptions that need to be tested in the new context.

**3 KEY FEATURES OF A THEORY OF CHANGE PROCESS**

**3.1 FROM COMPLEXITY TO FOCUS AND BACK**
Engaging with social transformation means understanding and navigating complex systems (see Box 4). ToC thinking helps us navigate by developing a manageable conceptual model of a system without oversimplifying it.
**Beware of falling into the trap of believing that a model replaces reality!**
A theory of change process starts with an extensive exploration of the system of interest. We create the big picture, exploring and understanding as best as possible the components and factors that make the system what it is and how it functions. Then, we make a series of informed strategic choices, ultimately leading to concrete, context-specific interventions. In order to make sure that the intervention is actually contributing to and remains relevant for the envisaged change, we zoom in and out of the bigger picture regularly, in the design process as well as the implementation phase. We must be alert to timely and effective switching between the broader thinking and the focus and clarity we need for decision making and implementation, and back.
A ToC process is typically a process of first diverging and then converging. It starts with brainstorming and in-depth exploration. To reap the full benefits of this phase we must try to be as open as possible, to expand our thinking and to step out of our comfort zone. The more we challenge ourselves and each other, the richer the thinking will be, with more potentially innovative and effective outcomes.
However, in order to move towards an actionable intervention we need to focus again. We bring diverse ideas together, prioritise strategic options, identify concrete and feasible opportunities, consider capacity and resources. The rich insights generated from the ToC process – shared information, insights, ideas and questions – need to be translated into a project design with realistic objectives and clear pathways of change.
The risk at that moment is to simplify too much and fall back into linear thinking. A similar challenge is keeping the rich thinking of the design stage active and shared throughout implementation. To achieve that, we need to actively use our bigger picture ToC to maintain the connection between interventions and their origins in the broader thinking about change.

***

Regular reviewing of the ToC – zooming in and out between the overall thinking and our experiences on the ground – is crucial and part of the process of monitoring, learning and evidence building. The MEL process and framework, describing what we need to know – thus need to monitor – , why we need to know it and how we are going to ensure that we do, provides guidance on how to use information to keep updating the ToC. When to zoom in and when to zoom out are signalled in the stepwise approach.

**BOX 4: DEFINITION OF A COMPLEX SYSTEM**
Characteristics of a complex system:
• Elements and dimensions are interconnected and interdependent;
• Interactions of elements result in emergent properties of the system;
• Feedback processes – ongoing action-reaction processes in the system – promote as well as inhibit change.
Systems are dynamic and in an ongoing state of change. Change in systems is emergent and not linear and can therefore be neither predicted, nor guaranteed.
System change is always contested. Many actors try to maintain or transform the status quo, operating from specific interests and perspectives. Their positions and relationships are characterised and conditioned by power and gender inequalities.

**3.2 MAKING ASSUMPTIONS EXPLICIT**
Our thinking about development and change is based on multiple assumptions about what triggers change. We make assumptions about how change processes ‘work’, about the context in which it takes place and about what will happen as a result of interventions.

**WHAT IS AN ASSUMPTION?**
An assumption is a belief or feeling that something is true or that something will happen, an assertion about the world we do not always question or check. Assumptions stem from and represent values, beliefs, norms and ideological perspectives that inform our interpretation and understanding of reality, and our expectations of what will happen. Assumptions are personal, but can also be part of collective convictions of a specific group having a similar social, cultural, political (etc.) background or history.
Assumptions are based in belief systems: notions and ideas that are so familiar or internalised that we take them for granted: ‘Fish don’t talk about the water’. Taken for granted, we may not be aware of making them and rarely question them. They are often reinforced because they frame how we see and understand the world, and how we interpret and give meaning to our personal experiences. We are all biased.
Our assumptions are not always valid. For example, we assume water will come out of the tap when we turn it on. We suddenly realise that this is an assumption when no water comes out and it raises a question about why this is happening. Surprises are therefore interesting eye openers about implicit assumptions.

**WHY ARE ASSUMPTIONS IMPORTANT IN TOC THINKING?**
Our personal beliefs and worldviews inform the assumptions underpinning the paradigms we uphold about how change happens and can best be achieved. One of Hivos’ key assumptions, for example, is that social change occurs by citizens collectively demanding their rights and pushing for responsive government. Our assumptions lay the foundation for how we view the anticipated change process, and they influence the design of an initiative. Likewise, they inform our judgement about what is appropriate and feasible in the context where we support social change interventions.
Articulating assumptions in a ToC process as rigorously as possible generates entry points for checking, feedback and ongoing analysis to feed into the next round of action. Box 5 highlights specific benefits of clarifying assumptions in a ToC process.

***

**BOX 5: WHY ASSUMPTIONS MATTER**
**More effective teams:** Personal and group values are surfaced, collective energy is generated, and differences are named and sometimes resolved. If not, they are noted and can be taken into account.
**Improving design and innovation:** Identifying those assumptions that most affect success can help people wake up to new options for action, and to help them choose the most critical pathways on which to focus planning efforts. This helps us move beyond ‘business as usual’.
**More coordinated and focused action:** By articulating the different ways in which individuals and organisations assume change will take place, the group can come to a negotiated shared meaning that can help coordinate different actions.
**Basis for adaptive management and risk management:** Monitoring outputs, assumptions and processes together enables you to respond in a timely manner to new information and adapt planning and strategies, and to decide on the most strategic next steps to take in complex contexts/processes. Critical assumptions are a good basis for risk management.
**More focused learning and evaluation:** Critical assumptions for which little knowledge or evidence exists can become the focus for a learning or (action) research to inform the change process. Critical pathways and assumptions help guide analysis and judgements in evaluation.
**Increased credibility:** An articulated set of assumptions can raise trust among those who have invested in an intervention or other key partners who are not directly involved in the design or intervention.

**TYPES OF ASSUMPTIONS**
Each step in a ToC process draws on different types of assumptions. Understanding their significance and identifying them are important for the quality of our ToC thinking.

**1) Assumptions about the context and the actors and factors at play**
When we intervene in a system with the intention of changing it, we make many assumptions about the context and what is influencing the situation. We make assumptions about the problem and its causes, about people’s needs, capacities, motivation and behaviour, about the roles, interests and relations of key actors. We make assumptions about which strategies would work in that context. We make assumptions about the belief systems, norms and values that shape people’s perceptions and responses, and might help or block what we try to achieve.

**2) Assumptions related to the pathways of change**
When we explore and articulate our theories of change, and develop our pathways of change, our assumptions are fully active. They concern the mechanisms at work between our intervention, the change objectives, the effects of specific strategic choices, the cause effect linkages, and conditions needed for change to occur. These assumptions represent our expectations of what will happen. They are not predictions. These assumptions merit critical questioning.
Assumptions underlying strategic choices in the ToC often relate to the ‘solution’ we think might work; for example: ‘Small scale farmers will be able to supply to regional markets if they have access to credit and market information’.
These assumptions are also made for project-level strategies; for example: ‘Community dialogues will change people’s attitudes towards domestic violence (which in turn will change their behaviour)’. We make many assumptions about the relevance, feasibility, effectiveness and sustainability of the strategies we use.
Developing our pathways of change is based in the causal thinking that shapes our logic of the change process. With each step we make assumptions about cause-effect relations in the pathway or results chain: ‘If we do X, then we think that Y will happen. If Y has happened, then Z will be the next step in the change process’. We may find that the causal link is only likely to be valid when certain conditions are in place. Take the example of ‘Free primary education is provided’, which is expected to lead to ‘Girls will come to and stay in school’. This causal link is clearly conditioned by many factors. If those conditions can be influenced by the intervention, activities to that effect should become part of the strategy and pathways of change. If not, the context should be closely monitored to ensure that the assumed conditions are actually there – or to change plans if they are absent.

**3) Assumptions related to conditions for and quality of implementation**
You may come across two other types of assumptions, which are less critical for ToC thinking. Sometimes assumptions are made about external conditions completely beyond the control of the intervention, such as ‘We assume that there is no regime change’ or ‘[…] that no natural disaster occurs’. Such assumptions are not useful for our thinking as they are obvious. Anyone would understand that under extreme circumstances implementation of plans would be disrupted and the objectives would not be achieved.
**NB:** If regime change is imminent, then of course the intervention should take this fully into account in its strategic thinking.

***

People also commonly make operational or implementation assumptions. Examples include: ‘We assume that participants will turn up for the training’ or ‘The content of the training is aligned with the participants’ needs’. These are clearly important issues to consider but they primarily concern the quality of implementation, and not necessarily the theory of change as such.
Also common is ‘We assume we’ll have mobilised sufficient funding to implement the programme’. This is so obvious that it is redundant.

**VALIDITY OF ASSUMPTIONS, EVIDENCE AND RISK ANALYSIS**
A ToC is based on a series of assumptions, so you need to know if they are valid or not. Core questions to ask: ‘Did we check our assumptions? Is there evidence that supports their validity?’ Assumptions should be checked with evidence from research, good practices, or the shared professional experience of the actors involved. Assumptions supported by evidence still need monitoring during implementation to ensure that they are also valid in this particular context.
Among the many assumptions underpinning an intervention, there may only be a few that are critical. This means that if these assumptions are not valid, the intervention will probably not work as planned. A risk analysis is useful in terms of knowing which assumptions are most critical to monitor. Categorising the full set of assumptions using the matrix in Figure 2 will help you identify the critical assumptions. Action will need to be taken in the case of those that are more likely to be invalid and have serious consequences. This may involve redesigning aspects of the intervention, close monitoring, integrating them into the research or learning agenda and evaluation.

**FIGURE 2: RISK ANALYSIS MATRIX**
(Summarized)
• **Low likelihood of being invalid / Mild consequences:** Don’t worry.
• **Low likelihood of being invalid / Serious consequences:** Can consequences be mitigated?
• **High likelihood of being invalid / Mild consequences:** Can risk be reduced?
• **High likelihood of being invalid / Serious consequences:** Watch out! High risk - rethink design.

***

**3.3 THE IMPORTANCE OF VISUALISATION**

**VISUALISATION TO SUPPORT EXPLORATION AND ANALYSIS**
People often find complex issues or situations easier to understand and to remember when supported by meaningful visualisation. Visualisation engages people with a visual learning style, complements dialogue and text and stimulates critical thinking.
Developing a theory of change is like forward storytelling – an expression of participants’ hopes, expectations and assumptions. Such a conversation can be awkward in the setting of a formal meeting. Not everyone speaks and individual contributions tend to remain open to multiple interpretation and unconnected to others’ experiences. The setting is not conducive for new thinking and emerging insights are easily lost.
Discussing while drawing together engages people in conversation and offers the opportunity to share different perspectives and question each other. Participants can return to certain points at a later stage, and dive deeper in a second round. The drawings stay with the group, to be used for several purposes during the rest of the ToC process.
Drawing while we explore and share our views of the desired change and how the current situation looks, for example in a Rich Picture, helps to bring out our inner thinking and to discover what others think. Assumptions can strike us in ways that might not happen in a discussion. The picture helps communicate with others. It helps to surface and overcome differences in perception and to ensure that we are talking about the same issues. It helps to grasp the complexity of the system and the challenges faced.
Visualisations made during a ToC process do not need to be beautiful. This is not about art but about analysis and learning! It does not matter how they look, as long as everybody involved in the process feels that they understand the visual products and that the picture(s) reflect the group’s thinking.

***

**VISUALISING FOR COMMUNICATION**
Another important function of visualising is communicating the ToC to people who were not involved in the process of developing it. The pictures and diagrams generated during the ToC process can inform the visualisation of the ToC as a product (see Chapter 6).

**4 QUALITY OF TOC PRACTICE**

**4.1 PRINCIPLES FOR TOC PRACTICE**
A ToC process, undertaken well, can lead to more inclusive, relevant and effective programmes and strategies. For its full value to materialise, the following principles for good practice are key.

**BOX 6: PRINCIPLES FOR GOOD TOC PRACTICE**
• Participation in ToC development
• Comprehensive analysis
• Power and gender lenses
• Assumptions articulated
• Regular and active use

**PARTICIPATION IN TOC DEVELOPMENT**
Participation of a wide range of stakeholders in the development and in the reviews of a ToC results in greater ownership and increases the chances of effective use. A diversity of perspectives improves the quality of the thinking, and consequently of the programme.
Who should be involved, and when? A clear statement of the purpose of the ToC process (see Chapter 5) helps to identify relevant participants. The perspectives from (local) stakeholders are a condition for a grounded ToC that represents the key actors’ ambitions, views and knowledge of the context and local dynamics. Assumptions about what needs to change, why and how may differ greatly, both within and between stakeholder groups (including the implementers).
If there is insufficient time in the design phase of a project (e.g. in response to a call for proposals) to include all relevant stakeholders, then provisions need to be made in the proposal to revisit the initial thinking with the stakeholders in the inception phase of the project. Likewise, a ToC may gain in quality if the initial draft is submitted for critical feedback of actors who are not directly involved in the programme, but can contribute to its success, or for review by thematic experts.

**COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS**
A sound analysis of context, actors and factors that influence the situation we would like to change is the foundation for a relevant programme or project. This does not mean an open ended analysis, mapping and researching every factor. The process needs to be guided by the ToC purpose: what really matters, what do we need to understand better, and why? The people for whom we aim to help improve the situation need to be at the centre of the analysis: what is their perspective, what is important to them and what influences their lives?
A ToC process must be informed by stakeholder perspectives and local knowledge, in order to ground the conversation in real and specific circumstances on the ground, and in multiple knowledges. At the same time, we need to make use of relevant knowledge from research and good practice elsewhere, in order not to fall into the trap of ‘business as usual’, going for familiar activities without questioning their relevance and utility. A good use of available knowledge also strengthens the evidence base of our assumptions.

***

**POWER AND GENDER ANALYSIS**
Inequalities in power and gender relations are strong causes of social injustice. Power and gender analysis are, therefore, central to any ToC process. The ToC (product) should make explicit the nature, sites and distribution of power - including gender relations. It should also document what that means for the strategic choices of the programme, and the assumptions being made with regard to (changing) power and gender relations. See sections 4.2 and 4.3 for more specific guidelines.

**ARTICULATION OF ASSUMPTIONS**
Identifying assumptions underlying people’s thinking about change is one of the most valuable aspects of a ToC process (as discussed in section 3.2). Making them explicit allows them to be debated and validated, contributing to mutual understanding and a genuinely strategic discussion. Critical assumptions are important for risk analysis. They need monitoring to test their validity and for the purpose of learning and knowledge generation.

**REGULAR UPDATE OF THE TOC AND ACTIVE USE IN PLANNING, MONITORING, EVALUATION AND LEARNING**
To be most effective, ToC use needs to be firmly embedded in the project cycle of the programme and the organisation. The ToC of a project or initiative forms the basis for the planning, monitoring, evaluation and learning framework. Monitoring key assumptions is particularly important for strategic planning and learning. Adaptive planning and management requires regular reviewing and updating of the ToC, so that the programme or initiative can accommodate emerging changes and new insights. A review of the ToC can be triggered by context changes, stakeholder shifts, operational problems, or when there are indications that a key assumption might not be valid. It is especially important to do when processes take unintended turns, to help make sense of events.

**FIGURE 3: PRINCIPLES, PURPOSES, PROCESS, PRODUCTS**
(A visual summary showing the relationship between products (Visual, Narrative, Plan to Learn, MEL Framework), process (steps using tools), purposes (Design, Revision, Quality Check, Evaluation), and principles (Participation, Analysis, Power/Gender, Assumptions, Active Use).)

***

**4.2 POWER AT PLAY**
Power plays a central role in Hivos’ analysis of the causes of poverty and inequality in the world (see Box 7). Consequently, power analysis is at the core of Hivos’ ToC thinking: if we aim to contribute to shifting power relations in a specific situation we need to know how power is distributed, which forms of power and power dynamics are at play, and how the people we aim to benefit are embedded in and affected by them.

**BOX 7: CIVIL VOICES ON A GLOBAL STAGE (Hivos 2002)**
“Injustice, poverty, gender inequality as well as the marginalisation and exclusion of large groups of the world population, are basically caused by unequal power relations at all levels of society: from political and economic relations at the international level to personal relations at individual and household levels. These unequal power relations determine – directly or indirectly – which interests are being represented, which voices are being heard and who is in the position to make claims in decision-making processes. The outcome perpetuates unequal access and unequal distribution of material and non-material means and resources, including rights and opportunities. The very people negatively affected by the outcome of these decision-making processes are only rarely participating or represented in them; and if they are, their opinion does not count equally.”

Power analysis helps us to ask the right questions in a ToC process and to rethink deeply rooted assumptions. It provides entry points for change interventions and appropriate strategies. The outcomes will enable us to sharpen our definition of success, and to define our MEL priorities and process accordingly. Power analysis is an effective way to uncover the reasons for gaps between theory and practice, between policy and implementation, between proposed solution and actual outcomes.
At the same time, power analysis can be a challenging process. It may lead to discomfort or even hostility because of the way it brings to light assumptions and realities that normally lie hidden, especially between actor groups. An experienced facilitator can help to overcome these challenges.
Two frameworks for power analysis that have proven to be effective tools of thought are:
• the ‘Expressions of Power’ by VeneKlasen and Miller, distinguishing between: Power Over, Power With, Power To and Power Within; and
• the ‘Power Cube’, developed by IDS.
These frameworks can be used separately or in combination. The Power Cube can build on and be used to further explore the concepts of ‘power over’, power to’, ‘power with’, and ‘power within’ (see Boxes 8 and 9, further explained in section 8.1).

***

**BOX 8: EXPRESSIONS OF POWER**
**Power Over:** The most commonly recognized form of power, power over, has many negative associations for people, such as repression, force, coercion, discrimination, corruption, and abuse. Power is seen as a win-lose kind of relationship.
**Power With:** Power with has to do with finding common ground among different interests and building collective strength. Based on mutual support, solidarity and collaboration, power with multiplies individual talents and knowledge. Power with can help build bridges across different interests to transform or reduce social conflict and promote equitable relations.
**Power To:** Power to refers to the unique potential of every person to shape his or her life and world. When based on mutual support, it opens up the possibilities of joint action, or power with.
**Power Within:** Power within has to do with a person’s sense of self-worth and self knowledge; it includes an ability to recognize individual differences while respecting others. Power within is the capacity to imagine and have hope; it affirms the common human search for dignity and fulfilment.
From: ‘A new Weave of Power, People & Politics’, Lisa VeneKlasen and Valerie Miller 2002

**BOX 9: THE POWER CUBE**
The Power Cube is a framework for analysing the levels, spaces and forms of power, and their inter-relationship. It helps us to explore various aspects of power and how they interact with each other. It lets us visually map ourselves and our situation, including other actors, relationships and forces, and then look at possibilities for movement, mobilisation and change. It helps to find entry points for action.

**4.3 GENDER (IN)EQUALITY**
Gender inequality is one of the most universal forms of inequality in the world and manifests itself in unequal power relations between men and women. Hivos promotes the empowerment of women in order to contribute to gender equality at all levels of society, by advancing women’s rights, including sexual and reproductive rights. Like power imbalances in general, Hivos sees gender inequality as one of the main causes of poverty and inequality in the world. Structural transformation requires changes in gender relations, so a fully integrated gender analysis is crucial in a ToC process. When discussing power issues and assumptions, gender power issues often remain hidden. They require specific and explicit attention.
We are all gender-biased, men and women alike. We have grown up with notions about our identity as women and men, or feeling that we did not fit these dominant social categories. We all internalised how our social and cultural environment viewed gender roles and what was appropriate for women and men to do, to be and to feel. Even when we have distanced ourselves from those notions, the way we see the world remains influenced by gender stereotypes.
When designing programmes or projects, our personal gender biases and assumptions make us overlook important gender issues. These biases inform and shape the ToC we are developing in terms of content – what matters. But biases also influence the process of how we generate theories of change, the concepts and methods we use. In particular, the identification and prioritisation of assumptions are not gender neutral.
Being mindful of gender dynamics goes well beyond just counting men and women. Throughout the ToC process, we have to take into account gender-differentiated needs, benefits, capacities, risks, influence in decision-making, division of labour, etc. A fully integrated gender analysis in a ToC process means that at all stages of the process, questions about strategic gender interests (see Box 10) are posed. Questions such as:
• Does the desired change benefit women and is it significant for them?
• To which strategic gender interest(s) does it contribute? Why do we think so? (assumptions)
• What gender inequalities are influencing the system?
• What gender dynamics are at play here?

**BOX 10: STRATEGIC GENDER INTERESTS**
Strategic gender interests relate to:
• changes in access to and control over resources;
• institutional changes such as laws, policies and resource allocation;
• changes in socio-cultural norms, beliefs and practices;
• changes in internalised attitudes, values and practices.
Strategic gender interests require medium to long-term change processes and concern changes at the levels of outcomes and impact.

**PART B**
**A STEPWISE APPROACH**

***

**5 DEVELOPING THEORIES OF CHANGE - EIGHT STEPS**

**THE EIGHT STEPS (Figure 4):**
1. Clarify Purpose of ToC Process
2. Describe Desired Change
3. Analyse Current Situation
4. Identify Domains of Change
5. Identify Strategic Priorities
6. Map Change Pathways
7. Define MEL Priorities and Process
8. Use and Adaptation of ToC

**INTRODUCTION**
The eight steps proposed in this chapter are a basic approach to guide you through any ToC process.
Each step includes an explanation of its essence and role in the ToC process, which will help you decide how to work with that step. Each step also contains a set of core questions to guide you, defines the output that should be produced and challenges you may encounter. Key points to consider are outlined. The tasks involved in each step are detailed, including reference to additional tools for thought that help prompt the critical thinking required in that step. If tools ask for a more elaborate explanation or can be used in different ways, that explanation is given in Chapter 8.

***

**STEP 1 CLARIFY THE PURPOSE OF THIS TOC PROCESS**

**WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?**
A clear purpose of going through a ToC process gives you a sense of direction and helps to ensure that the participants start off on the same foot.
The purpose informs decisions about who should participate in the process, how to shape the process, which levels it needs to encompass, what type of outputs or products you want to end up with and which questions need specific attention in each step.

**ESSENCE**
Determining a clear and shared purpose for this ToC process, in order to:
• know why you engage in the process and what you expect as a result;
• enable decision-making about the process.

**CORE QUESTIONS**
1. Why are we doing this? What do we want to be different for the team and our partners or allies as a result? Which specific benefits do we expect the process will bring us?
2. What is this ToC process expected to produce? What does that mean for the levels to address and the design of the process?

**OUTPUT**
A clear, documented statement of the purpose and level of the ToC process and product, including who needs to be involved in the process and why.

**CHALLENGES**
New insights gained from a ToC process are likely to challenge your thinking, practice and resource allocation.

**KEY POINTS TO CONSIDER**
1. There are two types of purposes for going through a ToC process that need consideration:
**a) Why are we doing this?** Thinking about why you are doing a ToC process and what will be different as the result, obliges you to be open to questioning your current practice. Are we doing ‘the right thing’? Is there a better mix of strategies than our usual repertoire, do we need to rethink resource allocation? Or, what is problematic that the ToC process might solve? Are there conflicting

***

perspectives in the team or partnership? Are we lacking evidence of what has and has not worked? Do changes in the context require a rethink of focus and feasibility?
**b) What is the intended product of this ToC process?** ToC thinking can be used for different purposes, as is explained in section 2.5 and summarised in Table 3. A ToC process to design a project is different from a strategy revision, or using ToC to develop a learning or research agenda.
These questions will need to be answered partly in preparing the ToC process with the larger group of stakeholders. However, both core questions need full attention at the start of the actual ToC development process with the wider group of participants. Clarity and understanding of the purpose of the process is necessary for aligning expectations and is conditional for full and successful participation.

**TABLE 3: PURPOSES OF TOC USE**
• **Programme or project design:** Comprehensive situation analysis (context, stakeholders, power, gender, etc.), stakeholder involvement, strategic choices, critical assumptions, MEL framework.
• **Strategy revision:** Regular revisit of ToC to review strategies in response to changes inside and outside the project, new insights, and evidence.
• **Quality review of existing programme:** Improve programme quality, make implicit assumptions explicit, sharpen strategies.
• **Strategic learning design:** Define learning questions, building evidence base, what works or not and under which conditions.
• **Evaluation:** Mid-term, end-term, validate assumptions, reconstruction of ToC.
• **Collaboration and collective MEL framework & process in a multi-actor initiative:** Develop joint strategic approach and collective MEL framework and learning agenda, with clear and agreed roles and responsibilities of each actor involved.
• **Scaling up or out:** Analysis of suitability and feasibility of scaling an initiative up and/or out in other locations, need for adaptation of the ToC, identify assumptions to be tested in the new context.

**NB** Experience learns that for most purposes of a ToC process a single workshop is not sufficient for developing all the Steps fully.

2. Part of clarifying the purpose of your ToC process concerns determining the level(s) of ToC thinking it needs to encompass. The appropriate level(s) directly relates to the ToC purpose and intended ToC product. It has consequences for the route you will take through the stepwise process and the aspects you need to emphasise.

***

The appropriate level of ToC thinking needs to be considered upfront because it is the most common stumbling block to a productive ToC process, especially in Step 6: Map Change Pathways. Without a clear focus, the mapping risks being too detailed at the higher level and becoming overwhelming, or lacking necessary detail at the project level. How to avoid this is explained below and in more detail in Step 6.
The ‘hourglass’ diagram (Figure 5) depicts how your ToC and change pathways can focus on:
a. developing a ToC at a high level of change (the level of Domains of Change - Step 4), encompassing the upper half of the hourglass;
b. developing a ToC at project level (Theory of Action), encompassing the lower half of the hourglass;
c. develop a full ToC, spanning both halves of the hourglass.

**FIGURE 5: THE HOURGLASS: CHANGE PATHWAYS AT DIFFERENT LEVELS**
[A diagram shaped like an hourglass showing the flow from Strategy/Outputs at the bottom up to Project Objectives in the middle, and then to Intermediate Outcomes and Domains of Change ending in Desired Change at the top.]

***

**a. Developing your ToC for the upper half of the hourglass**
This is relevant if the ToC process focuses on a (thematic) policy or strategic level. You explore and articulate the thinking of Hivos, the team or partnership about how change happens in a specific, but still broad area of change, for example Transparency & Accountability of governments, and how Hivos sees its role in this area.
• The focus and result of the mapping is on developing a ‘change’ or ‘system map’ rather than detailed pathways. This level of ToC thinking focuses on change processes with a long term horizon and is not yet context-specific, so going into too much detail is not productive. Assumptions about causal relations are based on evidence from research and Hivos’ experience in the specific area of change.
• You do not go down to the project level: many projects in different contexts can be designed based on and drawing from this higher level ToC.

**b. Developing a project level ToC, or Theory of Action (the lower half of the hourglass)**
You can start directly at the project level only when designing a project for which Hivos has already articulated a higher level ToC that can support and frame the process. However, you still need to go through Steps 1 (Purpose) and 3 (Current situation), to make the existing ToC thinking context-specific. You also need to think through – and be able to explain – how in this case the lower half of the hourglass (this specific project) links to the upper half: how does the project contribute to the envisaged larger, longer-term change process, and what is Hivos’ role in it?
• At the project level, the pathways of change need to be fully elaborated and the logic needs to be clear. Assumptions about cause-effect relations are clearly articulated and underpinned by evidence or other relevant information.

***

**c. Developing a full ToC (encompassing both halves of the hourglass)**
This is required and recommended in cases where no specific higher level ToC thinking is available and you need to develop the full ToC including the project level. For example, when you respond to a Call for Proposals in which only a high level goal, issue or domain of change is determined by the donor. The applicant is required to develop a specific project proposal and explain how that project will contribute to the achievement of the higher goal.
In such cases you have to articulate the full pathways of the ToC at both levels, but:
• in the upper half of the hourglass you do not elaborate the pathways in great detail. The focus is on clarifying your overall thinking about the change process and identifying key assumptions: the reader needs to understand the logic and quality of your overall ToC thinking;
• in the lower half of the hourglass you need to provide much more detail regarding the pathways of change: to sharpen your own strategic thinking and the design of the project, as well as to convince the reader that you are capable of implementing this project successfully.

**NB** There may be a fourth option: a donor provides its own overall ToC and asks Hivos to design a project. Or, a project level ToC is provided and Hivos is interested in implementing it, e.g. in a tender. It is crucial that we still go through our own ToC thinking process for each case, in order to know if Hivos’ thinking is aligned with that of the donor, or not. If the difference between the two is substantial, we should seriously consider not applying for the project. Poor alignment between Hivos and the donor is likely to lead to problems in implementation. If the gaps are not fundamental, we should use our ToC thinking to comment on the donor’s ToC, propose adaptation, and explain why we think that is the better option. In doing so, we may not only preclude problems in the implementation phase, but we also demonstrate our expertise and quality of thinking.

**TOOLS FOR THOUGHT**
• The two core questions
• Table 3 Purposes of ToC use
• The hourglass figure

**TASKS**
1. Discuss the first core question with the key stakeholders: Why are we doing this? What do we expect it will bring us? Be as specific as possible.
When you do this with a group of participants you can use facilitation methods that help making expectations and different perspectives explicit. Critical reflections from evaluations or reviews of other Hivos programmes relevant for this process can be used to trigger discussion.
2. Document the outcomes of your conversation and discuss what they mean in relation to:
• Who should be involved in the process?
• Which aspects or components of the ToC process need prioritising?
• How to design and plan the process; for example, how much emphasis and time to give to different steps?
3. Discuss the second core question: what is the purpose of ToC thinking in this case and what is the expected product? Use Table 3 for help and specify further for your specific project/programme.
4. Discuss what the purpose and expected product mean for the level(s) of ToC thinking. Discuss the hourglass diagram and decide which levels to encompass in the process. Document the outcomes of your conversation and the reasons for choices made.
5. Identify assumptions: Which assumptions are we making about the purpose of this ToC process? Do we need to check them? If so, how?
6. Update and complete documentation of the outputs of Step 1, in terms of:
• What is the purpose of the ToC process?
• Who should be involved and why?
• Which aspects or components of the ToC process need prioritising?

***

**STEP 2 DESCRIBE THE DESIRED CHANGE**

**WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?**
What you want to change, why and for whom is the core question of any ToC process.
The desired change represents the changes in people’s lives and the conditions and relationships in society that we wish to see occurring in the years to come and to contribute to by our actions.

**ESSENCE**
• Define a long-term change that is challenging and hard, stretching but just about reachable in 10 - 20 years’ time.
• ‘Head in the clouds, feet on the ground’.

**CORE QUESTION**
• What is the desired change, why and for whom?

**OUTPUT**
• Careful consideration of the people you want to benefit in a positive future situation.
• A statement of desired change, with assumptions, that is tangible, specific, and plausible.

**CHALLENGES**
• To define a people-oriented statement of change, not an abstract concept.
• The desired change must be ambitious, but not impossible to achieve.
• To identify assumptions.

**KEY POINTS TO CONSIDER**
1. How the desired change is chosen, formulated and viewed is conditioned by the identity, positioning, mind-sets, and interests of the people formulating the theory of change.
Reflect on who is involved in the articulation of the desired change:
• Who is defining the desired change, or dream? Who is initiating this process of analysis, and which other actors are involved?
• Are the people supposed to benefit from the initiative/programme involved in its design?
 – If not, when and how will they be involved or consulted?
 – How do they perceive and value what is articulated as the desired change?
 – If they are not involved: How do we know? If we do not know: when and how will we ensure we know?

***

2. There are two ways to start exploring the options for achieving change in a situation where that is deemed necessary or desirable:
a. by defining and analysing the problem.
b. by articulating the desired change.
Hivos chooses to use the latter, because a ‘desired change’ approach:
• takes a ‘positive’ starting point, which is motivating stakeholders;
• is more future-oriented;
• is more conducive to people using their imagination and creativity;
• gives direction more naturally to the strategic thinking and a delineation of the area of intervention, by its focus on the possible role(s) of the actors involved in the ToC process in achieving the change.
**NB** This choice does not mean that problem analysis is not important. In the next step (Analyse current situation) problem analysis is part of the process.

**BOX 11: BOTH STARTING POINTS CARRY SPECIFIC RISKS**
**Risks of a problem approach:**
• ‘negative’ starting point;
• tendency to focus too quickly on solutions;
• discouragement or loss of direction (e.g. by doing a problem tree analysis): so many causes and factors, where to start;
• tendency to address all factors playing a role in the problem, leading to fragmentation of efforts and resources.
**Risks of a desired change approach:**
• a limited analysis by focusing only on what the main actor(s) involved are able to ‘offer’;
• to start with unrealistic, too ambitious dreams.

**TOOLS FOR THOUGHT (see section 8.1)**
• Rich Picture
• Four Dimensions of Change
• Celebrating Success: the Time Machine/Helicopter, the Party, or the Conference

**TASKS**
1. Concentrate on changes in and among individuals, organisations, social structures, cultural patterns, and institutions, to which Hivos wants to contribute, in a time perspective of 10 to 20 years. The desired change must be plausible: there must be a sufficient degree of probability that the change can happen.
2. Visualise and draw the desired change or ‘dream’.
Visualising helps the group to bring to the surface and share individual thoughts, to start the conversation, to stretch thinking, and to merge the ideas of different team members into a shared view. The drawing itself is helpful to zoom in (and out) on specific parts of the full picture and explore them further. See also section 3.3: The importance of visualisation.

***

Picture the desired change as concretely as possible:
• Who are the people the desired change should benefit: for whom will the situation have changed positively, and in what way?
Be specific (gender, age, ethnicity, etc.):
• Will the change work out differently for different categories of people? In what way? Why?
• How do women benefit from this change and is it significant for them?
• What will have changed? Think of: attitudes, capabilities, behaviour, relationships, institutions, policies, norms, values, etc. (e.g. using the Four Dimensions of Change)
3. Describe the desired change as a change statement, specifying changes for specific groups of people, women and men.

**Example of a change statement**
Girls and young women in Malawi are better able to make their own choices in life, because the Malawi government prevents abuses and protects the rights of the girl child through the implementation of an appropriate legal framework; and because sexual and reproductive health service provision is responsive to the needs of young people, in particular girls and young women.

4. Discuss and document assumptions related to the desired change.

**ASSUMPTIONS**
Guiding questions:
• Why is this change desirable?
• Why does this change matter to us (worldview, values, etc.)?
• Which ideas and convictions about change underlie our picture of the desired change?
• What social beliefs in the context (where the desired change should occur) does this change, build on or challenge?

**BOX 12: QUESTIONS FOR DIVING DEEPER INTO ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE PEOPLE AFFECTED**
What do we assume about:
• who the affected people, women and men, are?
• how homogenous or diverse this group is?
• what their perspectives and interests in the issue are? Are these the same, or different?
• what the affected people need? Or: what the situation/society needs?
• how the affected people deal with or respond to the issue/problem?
• what the affected people value?

***

**STEP 3 ANALYSE THE CURRENT SITUATION**

**WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?**
Every change initiative takes place in a context that determines the conditions and the opportunities for change. We need to understand the situation to be able to make strategic choices that increase the chances of success.
This step is about analysis of the current situation and the issues we wish to change: the ‘ecosystem’ in which the desired change is supposed to take place: which social, political, economic, cultural, ecological and geographical factors directly influence the issue, its causes or effects, and the desired change process? What are the roles and interests of stakeholders and other actors? Where are power and gender dynamics at play? What are drivers of change and opportunities?

**ESSENCE**
Generate a broad – and shared – understanding of the system in which the desired change is needed.

**CORE QUESTION**
What is the current situation in relation to the issue(s) we wish to change?

**OUTPUT**
• A rich picture about the issues and situation for which the change is desired.
• Key stakeholders & their stakes (interest in and influence over).
• Institutions, structures, processes, interrelationships, issues, conflicts, resources, blockages, opportunities, etc.
• Knowledge gaps identified.

**CHALLENGES**
• To analyse with sufficient depth without losing focus on what really matters.
• To consistently include power and gender analysis.

**KEY POINTS TO CONSIDER**
1. This step is often called ‘context analysis’. At Hivos, we understand that issues and situations are affected by the interplay of local, national, regional and international dynamics, so we tend to think about ‘systems’. Lasting change requires system change. This means engaging with a multitude of influencing factors, interacting, pushing and pulling in different directions. System change is always contested: there are many actors with stakes in both the status quo as well as in changing it, and who have different interests and perspectives. Their positions and relationships are characterised and conditioned by power and gender inequalities (see also 3.1).

***

2. This step is about understanding how people experience issues in a holistic way – a health issue may have knock-on effects on income and education, etc. A good place to start is by placing the people most affected, or who you want most to benefit, at the centre of the situation analysis.
3. It can be difficult to set boundaries for a system or situation analysis: you and other participants may be tempted to throw the net too wide or to go on for too long. How deep the analysis needs to be depends on your purpose, so ask yourself what you want to get out of it, what questions you want answered. To make your situation analysis purposeful and focused, you can ask: ‘Is everyone happy with this as a general description or are there critical gaps?’ If necessary, you can limit the time to be spent on it. Important factors not surfaced in this step may come up in next steps and can be added then.
4. In this step, the Rich Picture is proposed as the main tool for exploring the overall situation. Depending on the issue at hand, you may need to do an analysis of a specific aspect of the issue at hand in the ‘dive deeper’ phase, using another analytical tool. For example, a specific gender framework, a Power Cube exercise, or a tool mapping influence and interest. Make sure you include the outcomes of such an exercise in the Rich Picture, and also keep it as a separate output, to use in later stages of strategic thinking.

**TOOLS FOR THOUGHT (see section 8.1)**
• Rich Picture
• Stakeholder and actor analysis, Influence matrices
• Power analysis: Power Cube, Expressions of Power (see also section 4.2)
• Gender analysis (see also section 4.3)
• Framings

**TASKS**
1. Draw a Rich Picture of the current situation. As a (sub)group you draw one picture together, which can have many different elements. Do not discuss, but explain to each other what you are drawing and why. Think of including:
• stakeholders & their stakes: who are they, how are they affected by the issue? How do they influence it? What is their interest?
• causes and effects of the issue/situation you want to change
• relevant context factors.
Draw linkages where relevant.
2. After a first round, take a step back and discuss what is there, how you understand it and what is missing. Take a second round.
3. Dive deeper by analysing:
• Power relations between the actors and factors on the drawing – who has power over, power to, power with, power within. Use the Power analysis frameworks in section 4.2. Which forms of power and power dynamics are influencing the situation? (in society, social life, organisations, family, etc.). Where and how do power inequalities play out in the issue at hand?

***

• Gender dynamics: make gender specific factors in the context and stakeholder/actor analysis explicit. What gender inequalities are influencing the system? (See Box 13: Gender analysis).
• Perspectives of key actors, using different framings.
Include the outcomes in your drawing.

**BOX 13: GENDER ANALYSIS**
How is the current situation in terms of:
• The status of women and their ability to exercise their human rights;
• The gender division of labour and workload of women;
• Access to and control over resources of women as compared to men (including mobility);
• Influence of women in decision-making at household, community and society levels (as compared to men);
• Self-determination of women over their body, reproduction and sexuality;
• Social beliefs and norms about gender roles: what women and men should and should not do and be; images of women in society;
• Violence against women;
• Organisational capacity of women and representation of women’s interests.
**NB** When we speak of ‘women’ and ‘men’: who do we mean? Which women, which men?

4. If not already there, you can refine your drawing and analysis further by adding:
• Interrelationships, conflicts, agreements, resources (e.g. people, money, assets, skills);
• Nature of interrelationships (e.g. strong/weak, conflicted/collaborative, direct/ indirect);
• Non-material aspects affecting how stakeholders, stakes, structures and processes interact: aspirations, goals, motivations, values and norms;
• How factors manifest themselves at the local, subnational, national, regional and/or international level. To what extent are these factors being influenced by developments at those levels?
5. Discuss and write down assumptions made. Give examples.

**ASSUMPTIONS**
Discuss and document:
• Why have we assessed the current situation as we did? What beliefs, values and perspectives are shaping our analysis?
• Why are these the stakeholders and actors that matter?
We have included these stakeholders because […]

***

• Why do we judge specific influences as helping or hindering, particularly power and gender dynamics?
We have identified factors as helping or hindering because […]
• Are our assumptions shared, or do we have different perspectives?
We differ in the following observations and assumptions because […]
• Do we have evidence that our assumptions are true?
**Evidence:**
• On the basis of what evidence, knowledge, experiences or impressions do we make our assumptions?
• What data and research are available about the situation and the issue at hand? To what extent do these confirm or question our assumptions?
• Which (additional) data and research are needed for us to feel comfortable about the core of our situation description?

**LOOK BACK, REVIEW AND FINE-TUNE**
What do the outcomes of this step mean for the initial outcome of the previous step? Do we need to make any adjustments? Why?
> Review and fine-tune

See next page for Questions for diving deeper into Context and Stakeholder analysis.

**BOX 14: QUESTIONS FOR DIVING DEEPER INTO CONTEXT AND STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS**
**NB** Not all these questions need to be answered. Choose what is relevant for your purpose, or what has not yet been discussed.

**Stakeholders & other actors of influence**
• Who are the key stakeholders that affect or are affected by the change process?
• How do these stakeholders relate to each other?
• Which other actors play an important role in the issue/ change process? Is their role helping or hindering?
• What is the political and governance landscape like: who can influence the desired changes? Who owns the decisions that really have an impact on the context?
• How do actors perceive the people most affected by the situation?
• What are the interests and positions of the stakeholders in the issue? Where do their interests conflict or align?
• What is the motivation, capacity and opportunity of actors to change? What are their incentives, constraints, drivers, agendas? What might motivate them to do what is necessary to achieve the envisaged change?
• If relevant: what drives actors who actively cause, reproduce or maintain the problem? (Interest, habit, lack of knowledge, power, greed, etc.)

**Context**
• Which political, social, historical and economic conditions affect or are affected by the change process?
• Which societal structures (formal and non-formal institutions, legal frameworks, cultural practices, etc.) play a role and how do they affect the process?
• What are (historical) areas of conflict and the causes of conflict?
• What gender specific factors, actors, values and dynamics are at play? See also box on gender analysis.
• Which geographical or environmental factors are of importance?

**Opportunities for change**
• Is there recognition of the need for change? By whom?
• Are there different perspectives or alternatives for the dominant view in society? By whom are these held or promoted?
• What or who are drivers of change in the system? Where are opportunities for change?
• What gender-differentiated or gender-related opportunities are present?

***

**STEP 4 IDENTIFY DOMAINS OF CHANGE**

**WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?**
Now the current situation has been explored and mapped, we need to identify the domains where important changes have to take place in order to achieve the overall desired change.
Identifying the domains of change helps to make the complexity more manageable, and to determine what matters for the desired change, and for the people who we hope will benefit from that change. It enables us to decide where best to intervene.
To make the desired change possible, changes usually need to happen simultaneously in many different domains and amongst different groups of stakeholders.
For example, changes may be needed in formal institutions and the behaviours and relationships of actors involved in those, like the legal system; changes in the behaviour and relationships that shape people’s participation in political
