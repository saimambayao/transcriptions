**WHEREAS,** under Section 22, Article XIII of R.A. No. 11054 states that “The Bangsamoro Government shall have exclusive powers over inland waters, including lakes, marshes, rivers, and tributaries within its territorial jurisdiction, except those that provide energy to power generating plants. The Parliamentary shall enact laws on the regulation, conservation, management, and protection of these resources, and may classify inland waters in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. It shall create a Bangsamoro Authority and offices for specific inland bodies of water that shall exercise management and regulatory powers over these bodies of water.

**WHEREAS,** Liguasan Marsh, located in Southern Mindanao, is the largest Marsh wetland in the Philippines, covering over 220,000 hectares, spread across the provinces of Maguindanao, Cotabato, and Sultan Kudarat.

**WHEREAS,** according to Military Public Affairs chief Col. Noel Detoyato, the marshland is very fertile for planting crops, which makes it “very inviting” for civilian habitation. The rich patches of lands of Liguasan grow one of the best varieties of corn and rice in the country, with the villagers cultivating what is locally called as Tapul or Denorado for avid staple consumers.” (*Business Mirror, The Terrain, June 24, 2018*).

**WHEREAS,** about 30,000 hectares are designated as a game refuge and bird sanctuary. It is home to rare birds that can only be found in the Marsh. The Marsh also serves as a nesting place of the famous Philippine Monkey – eating Eagle (*Pithecophaga jeffery*). The Philippine Crocodile (*Crocodylus mindorensis*), which is endangered, as well as the larger Estuarine Crocodile or Saltwater Crocodile (*Crocodylus porosus*) have made the Marsh their home.

**WHEREAS,** Liguasan Marsh is also thought to hold large reserves of oil and natural gas. The presence of gas deposits in Maguindanao was confirmed by the Tukanakuden Oil Exploration project by the Philippine National Oil Co. in 1997, and whose drilling equipment were secured by Detoyato and his team then.

**WHEREAS,** “Liguasan Marsh will benefit the Moros and all the residents that live within and even in the surrounding areas and provinces if it really has oil deposits. It will be put into good use,” said Detoyato.

**WHEREAS,** in the 2020-2022 12-Point Priority Agenda of Bangsamoro Development Plan Authority (BDPA-BARMM) Liguasan Marsh was highlighted for its exploration primarily to harness its economic potentials and boost economic development in the Bangsamoro.

**WHEREAS,** the presence and deployment of Philippine Army, Philippine National Police and other security branches of the national government are greatly encouraged in the area of Liguasan Marsh, for the propagation, harmonious living, peaceful and orderly occupancy of the Bangsamoro inhabitants, advancement and development of the territory, financial feasibility, sustainability and economic development, for business intervention as additional source of revenue for Bangsamoro Government.

**WHEREAS,** in pursuance to the Bangsamoro aspiration of the exploration, development and utilization of Liguasan Marsh the presence of security sectors of the Philippine government is required for the protection, enforcement, and proper administration of the provisions necessary for its implementation.

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,** as it is hereby resolved by the Bangsamoro Parliament of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao in **A RESOLUTION URGING THE PHILIPPINE ARMY GENERAL HEADQUARTERS FOR THE CREATION OF SPECIAL UNIT OF THE 6TH INFANTRY KAMPILAN DIVISION THAT WILL MAINTAIN THE SECURITY, PEACE, AND ORDER IN LIGUASAN MARSH AS WELL TO SUPPORT THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLAN OF BARMM AND TO PROVIDE NECESSARY EQUIPMENT, PROVISIONS, AND FUNDS ESSENTIAL FOR CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT OF THE SPECIAL UNIT TO BE CREATED.**
